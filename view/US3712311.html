                        <p> The invention provides a novel combination of a nail clipper and molded plastic case or retaining body therefor, such that the clipper is available for ready use, apart from the body, by overcoming a retaining detent-engagement action between interfering parts of the body and clipper. The arrangement is such that the spring lever of the clipper serves as a clip, to resiliently hold the assembled clipper and body in a clothing or other pocket. In the form described, the body member is a hair comb, in which case, the lever of the clipper is the spring clip by which both grooming-tool functions are pocket-retained and readily available for use. </p>

                        <p>   Another specific object is to provide a novel pocketclip function for a device of the character indicated.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Other objects and various further features of novelty and invention will be pointed out or will occur to those skilled in the art from a reading of the following specification, in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. In said drawings:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 1 is a view in perspective of an assembled clipper device of the invention;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 2 is a simplified fragmentary view in perspective to show the device of FIG. 1, retained in a garment pocket;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 3 is an exploded fragmentary view in perspective to illustrate the body member of FIG. 1, just prior to clipper assembly thereto;   </p>
                    
                        <p>  FIG. 4 is a sectional view at the plane 4-4 of FIG. 2;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 5 is a sectional view at the plane 55 of FIG. 3; and   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 6 is a view <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">similar t</span>o FIG. 5 to illustrate a modification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The invention is shown in application to a combined tool wherein a finger-nail clipper 10 is removably retained <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">in a body member 11 whi</span>ch is capable of performing<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> a different to</span>ol function, namely a hair comb. The body member 11 is elongate along its back or <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">body 12, and ha</span>s plural comb teeth 13<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> extending trans</span>versely f<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">rom one longitudinal </span>edge. Body member 11 may be of suitable molded plas<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">tic material.  </span> </p>
                    
                        <p>   The nail clipper 10 may be of conventional config<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">uration, compris</span>ing opposed stiffly compliant elongate jaw members 14-15, secured as by welding at one end (16) and formed with spaced cutting ed<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">ges 17-18 a</span>t the other longitudinal end. A reversible actuating lever 19 is mounted agai<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">nst the outer face of the uppe</span>r jaw, being compressionally pinned thereto by a headed rivet 20 which passes through aligned <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">openings near th</span>e cutting endsof the jaw members. The actuating lever 19 is of generally arched con<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">tour and in the fol</span>ded position shown, a foot contact exists at 21, at a location longitudinally intermediate the rivet 20 and cutting edge 18. Under this circ<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">umstance,</span> the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> stiff spring ac</span>tion of jaws applies a turning moment to lever 19, resiliently loading the free end 22<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> thereof </span>against the adjacent face<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> ofjaw 15.  </span> </p>
                    
                        <p>   Near one longitud<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">inal end, the body 12 i</span>s characterized by a cavity 24 which<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">, as bes</span>t shown in FIG. 3, is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">shaped and</span> contoured generally in accordance with the planform of the jaws 14-15. Cavity 24 is shown fully open at the upper fa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ce of body</span> 12 and is only partly open at the lower <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">face; al</span>so as shown, the lower face is characterized by an outwardly bulging wall or walls, so accommodated to the profile of the clipper 10 that the inserted clipper is neste<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">d in cavity</span> 24 with its folded lever 19 substantia<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">lly adjace</span>nt the up<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">per face of body</span> 12 (as best seen in FIG. 1). The body 12<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> has a p</span>rincipal thickness T which app<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ears at </span>the cut-out 25 in the bulging lower wall or face <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">of body 12.</span> Thus, a tapering shallow bulge 26 de<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">fines th</span>e bottom <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">wall of cavity 24 at the s</span>ecured end 16 of the jaw me<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">mbers, and</span> a simi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">larly tapering </span>deeper bulge 27 defines th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">e bottom wall of the cavity at the </span>cutting ends (17-18).   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Snap-detent means coacts between clipper 10 and body 12 in the course of clipp<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">er assembly</span> to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">cavity 2</span>4. As shown, a pair of opposed detent<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> projectio</span>ns 28-28 (integral with body 12 and in the general longitudinal regio<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">n of ope</span>ning 25) extent toward each other to prese<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">nt detent i</span>nterference with the side edges of jaws 14-15 in the course of such assembly. This relation is held pending disassembly, as by thumb-depression access tojaw 14 via the open<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">ing 25.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As noted above, the a</span>ssembled<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> clipper 10</span> and body 12 present leve<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">r 19 adjacent the upp</span>er f<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ace of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">b</span>ody 12 (see FIG. </span>5), with the hinge point of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> lever 1</span>9 near the upper or cutting end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> assembly</span>. Thus, the free end of lever 19 faces downwardly, and when the assem<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">bly is in</span>serted into a pocket 29 (FIG. 2), as for example a coat poc<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">ket, the l</span>ever 19 will resiliently ride over and pinch<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> the uppe</span>r edge 30 of the pocket. If the detent-re<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">tained plane o</span>f the upper surface of jaw 15 (near end 16) is slightly below the up<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">per fac<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"></span>e of body 12,</span> then the pinch action by lever 19-wi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ll be la</span>terally stabilized and self-centering, in that pocket edge 30 is caused to engage cavity sid<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">e-wall edges wh</span>ich are in the pinch region; this centering action can be enhanced by provision of further integral grip projections 31-31 on opposite lateral sides of cavity 24 and in the indicated longitudinal r<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">egion, as </span>will be understood.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 6 shows a modification in which a retaining lug or lugs 33 is formed locally in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> the upper face of body 1</span>2 and at the secured-jaw end of the cav<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ity 24, </span>while the bulging wall 34 in the l<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ower face </span>of body 12 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">is longitudinall</span>y centrally located. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">A furthe</span>r retaining lug 35 in the lower face of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> body 12 projects to supp</span>ort the cutting ends <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">of the j</span>aws, leaving a finger-access opening 36 through which to dis<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">lodge the clipper; oppose</span>d detents 37 project toward each other <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">to resiliently inte</span>rfere with jaw insertion and removal. In this embodiment, the secured end 16 is first inserted under lug 33<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">, and then the </span>cut<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">ting end is snapped in place</span>, to retain the inserted assembly.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The desired construction will be seen to achieve all stated objects, for the specific case of a clipper-andcomb combination. The combination of the clipper 10 with body 12 may also achieve stil<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">l further t</span>ool c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ombinati</span>ons, with or without the comb feature 13. For example, as illustrated <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">by FIG. 1, the l</span>ower part of body 12 may be formed with a second cavity 40<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> to inse</span>rtably receive a furt<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">her tool 41, the </span>same being detachably he<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">ld in place by l</span>ug and detent means analogous to that described for clipper 10. Thus, cavity 40 may<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> be shaped in accordance </span>with th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">e planform</span> of tool 41, shown as a knife-like tool with a pi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">voted bl</span>ade or blades within a folded U-shaped channel or case 42. The lower<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> face of body 31 may be bulbous as </span>necessary to receiv<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">e tool 4</span>1, and retaining-lug means 43 a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">nd detent means </span>44-44<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">&#39; at the upper face</span> of body 12 may hold the assembled relation. It w<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ill be a</span>ppreciated that for such assembly of the added tool 41, longitudinally spaced beneath <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">clipper 10, th</span>e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> mass of tool 41 produces a pendulous sta</span>bilizing acti<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">on to be</span>tter preserve the vertical orientation of the entire assembly, from the edge 30 to which it is clip-pinched by means <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">19.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   </span>While the invention has been de<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">scribed i</span>n detail for the forms shown, it will be understood that modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. And the term molded plastic,&#34; as used herein, will be understood to include other materials, such as hard rubber, suitable for the indicated purposes.   </p>
