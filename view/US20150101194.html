                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> Pet nail clippers contains a fixed grip, a movable grip connected with the fixed grip, a housing, an adjusting bolt, and a cutting assembly. The housing includes a beak portion and a neck portion coupling with the fixed grip which includes a receiving cavity. The cutting assembly includes a movable blade and a fixed blade disposed in the receiving cavity and extending out of the beak portion, and the movable blade contacts with the fixed blade and extends out of the beak portion. The movable blade is coupled with a driving rod connecting with the movable grip, the driving rod includes a second end coupling with a resilient element. The resilient element includes a second end mounted on the fixed grip, the housing also includes a through hole communicating with the movable blade, such that the adjusting bolt inserts through the through hole to abut against the movable blade. </p>

                        <p> FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    The present invention relates to pet nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    A conventional pet nail clippers contain a fixed blade and a movable blade moving relative to the fixed blade. The fixed blade is made of plastic material, so it is broken easily after a period of using time. In addition, the fixed blade cannot contact with the movable blade completely, so the conventional pet nail clippers cannot trim pet&#39;s nails sharply.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    The present invention has arisen to mitigate and/or obviate the afore-described disadvantages.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0004]    The primary object of the present invention is to provide pet nail clippers which adjust a connecting tightness of a movable blade and a fixed blade.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    To obtain the above objective, pet nail clippers provided by the present invention contains: a fixed grip, a movable grip connected with the fixed grip, a housing, an adjusting bolt, and a cutting assembly.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    The housing is hollow and includes a beak portion and a neck portion coupling with one end of the fixed grip, the fixed grip includes a receiving cavity defined on the first end thereof, the cutting assembly includes a movable blade and a fixed blade disposed in the receiving cavity and extending out of the beak portion of the housing, and the movable blade contacts with a top surface of the fixed blade and extends out of the beak portion of the housing, the movable blade is coupled with a first end of a driving rod which is in connection with the movable grip, the driving rod includes a second end coupling with a first end of a resilient element, the resilient element includes a second end mounted on the fixed grip, such that after the movable grip is rotated, the resilient element pulls the driving rod, and the driving rod drives the movable blade to move forwardly relative to the fixed blade, the housing also includes a through hole defined therein and communicating with the movable blade, such that the adjusting bolt inserts through the through hole to abut against the movable blade.  </p>
