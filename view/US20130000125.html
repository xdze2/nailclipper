                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> The actuated nail clipper is a grooming tool that has made it easier to clip nails. The present invention can change in length so the toe nails are easily reachable for the consumer. The elongated neck prevents the consumer from feeling any discomfort that is normally associated with clipping toe nails. A vacuum on the actuated nail clipper can suction in leftover nail clippings. The convenience of the vacuum allows for easier clean up. The present invention also includes a small light that is angled so the nail that is being cut is clearly visible to the consumer. The light helps reduce errors in nail clipping as well as decrease the strain on the consumer&#39;s eyes. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    The present invention relates generally to a battery operated, self-actuating nail clipper. It is the objective of the present invention to provide people, especially those with injuries or disabilities, a way to clip toe nails without strain and a way to clean nail clippings conveniently. The present invention also provides a way for the nail clippings to be cleaned in an easier manner than present conventions.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    Personal grooming is something that applies to everyone, young or old, able or disabled. However, some personal grooming tasks are sometimes more difficult for some rather than others. One of these common personal grooming tasks is toe-nail clipping. A traditional nail clipper is quite small and fits in the palm of a hand. While they are quite convenient to clip finger nails, they are cumbersome to use for toenails. Usually, when attempting to clip toenails, an individual has to maneuver his body in rather unusual positions. These positions range from hunching over one&#39;s legs while sitting or even lifting one&#39;s foot on a table surface so the toe nails are reachable. Either position can be strenuous for the body to be in for extended amount of time. Keeping the body in these strained positions for very long can lead to multiple injuries. The present invention eliminates the need for bending over and remaining in a strained position. Additionally, the present invention allows a way for the nail clippings to be easily vacuumed and cleaned up. Nail clippings can be difficult to search for and dispose of. It is also a rather lengthy task. The Actuated Nail Clipper creates a way to discard nail clippings promptly and easily. Also, the present invention allows the individual user to view the nails easily because of its implemented LED light. The Actuated Nail Clipper is a convenient fix to the problems that arise from using traditional nail clippers on toenails.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAIL DESCRIPTIONS OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0023]    All illustrations of the drawings are for the purpose of describing selected versions of the present invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    In reference to  FIG. 1 ,  FIG. 5 ,  FIG. 6 ,  FIG. 8 ,  FIG. 9 ,  FIG. 10 ,  FIG. 11 ,  FIG. 12 ,  FIG. 13 , and  FIG. 16 , and  FIG. 17 , the Actuated Nail Clipper comprises of four major components, which include an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">end cap  1</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">neck  3</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">head  4</span> . These components can also be broken down further into smaller systems and sub systems. For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span>  has five major systems. The five systems include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">motor assembly  5</span> , an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">actuating system  6</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">vacuum system  7</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">control panel system  8</span> , and a plurality of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">soft grips  9</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">neck  3</span>  has two main components, which include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">telescopic neck assembly  10</span>  and an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">exterior segment  11</span> . The last assembly, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">head  4</span> , can be separated into a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">head plate assembly  12</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">clipper system  13</span> , and an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">LED light  14</span> . The Actuated Nail Clipper also includes a rechargeable dock station that helps not only to hold the present invention, but also helps it retain its power.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]    Once again, in reference to  FIG. 1 ,  FIG. 2 ,  FIG. 6 ,  FIG. 8 ,  FIG. 9 ,  FIG. 10 ,  FIG. 12 , and  FIG. 13 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span> , which is secured by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">end cap  1</span> , is important to the Actuated Nail Clipper&#39;s function because it contains the majority of the systems involved in making the Actuated Nail Clipper operate successfully. One constant problem of all nail clippers is the lack of control concerning nail clippings. More often than not, the nail clippings fly away, landing in unusual or hard to reach places. As a result, cleaning the clippings is a difficult task because they become either hard to find or difficult to pick up when they are found. Also, nails clippings are very light in color, making it difficult to be visible on a surface that is lighter or of the same coloring. This problem is even more prevalent in hospitals and nursing homes where residents are usually elderly, handicapped, or ill and cannot clip their nails themselves. In cases like these, nurses come and cut the patient&#39;s nails on their behalf. It usually occurs on the patient&#39;s bed because they cannot be transported anywhere else. Not all nail clippings can always be found and cleaned up quickly. Nurses have many tasks to accomplish throughout the day and as a result need to be able to finish one task in an efficient manner before moving on to the next. Cleaning up nail clippings with hands is not an efficient method of cleaning because of the time needed to search for the clippings. This is especially true for nurses in hospitals or nursing homes. It is important to prevent the patient from feeling any discomfort and disturbance. Quickly cleaning the nail trimmings equates to less disturbance for a patient. The Ac<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">tuated Nail Clipper&#39;s vacuum system  7</span>  is the solution to a quick clean up of unruly nail clippings. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">vacuum system  7</span>  is a suction tool that uses a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">vacuum tube  25</span>  to pick up the uncontrollable clippings and store them in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">nail container  26</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">vacuum tube  25</span> , which is embedded within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">neck  3</span> , is nearly as long as the entire Actuated Nail Clipper, ending at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">nail container  26</span>  located at the bottom of the present invention and reaching the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">head  4</span> . The clippings are not in danger of falling out of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">nail container  26</span>  because the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">nail container  26</span>  is secured by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">end cap  1</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">ventilation cuts  27</span>  are narrow cuts that traverse through the exterior surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">nail container  26</span> . These <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">ventilation cuts  27</span>  are positioned below the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">vacuum motor  21</span> . Since the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">vacuum motor  21</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">battery  20</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">actuator motor  16</span>  will constantly run until the basic functions are turned off, there can be a lot of heat generated. If the heat is not expelled properly, the present invention can overheat and become dysfunctional. Consequently, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">nail container  26</span>  can be emptied whenever it is convenient for the consumer to do so. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">vacuum system  7</span>  helps to clean nail clippings quickly and efficiently because there is no need to meticulously search for nail clippings. To keep all the components inside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span>  intact, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">end cap  1</span>  can screw onto the end of the body, creating a secure fit. A base of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span> , including the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">end cap  1</span> , can rest inside a dock when the Actuated Nail Clipper is not in use. Since the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">vacuum system  7</span>  needs to create a suction force to be able to pull in all the nail clippings, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">fan  48</span>  is needed to create sufficient air flow. The Actuated Nail Clipper uses a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">vacuum motor  21</span>  in conjunction with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">vacuum fan  48</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">battery  20</span> . This <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">vacuum motor  21</span> , with its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">attached vacuum fan  48</span> , will be able to generate air that flows through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">vacuum tube  25</span>  and up to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">head  4</span> . As a result, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">vacuum tube  25</span>  can be used on any area that needs to be cleaned. Also, nail clippings are often times very small and can get stuck in various cracks or crevices. The Actuated Nail Clipper is useful because of its ability to use its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">vacuum system  7</span>  in small cracks and crevices, which allows cleaning up to be a much easier task. Another advantage to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">vacuum system  7</span> , is that it also provides for a more sanitary clean up since nails are often times dirty or fungus-ridden. With the vacuum, the nail clippings can be gathered and disposed of without anyone having to come into contact with it. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">vacuum motor  21</span>  is a part of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">motor assembly  5</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">motor assembly  5</span>  is the component of the Actuated Nail Clipper that controls most of its functions. It contains, aside from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">vacuum motor  21</span> , an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">actuator motor  16</span> , a plurality of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">cavities (top  15</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">bottom  17</span> , and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">middle  18</span> ) and a plurality of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">connector arms  19</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">vacuum motor  21</span> , as mentioned earlier, is used to create a suction force inside the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">vacuum tube  21</span>  with its fan. Since the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">vacuum motor  21</span>  can be easily damaged, it is housed inside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">bottom cavity  18</span> . Consequently, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">bottom cavity  18</span>  protects the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">vacuum motor  21</span>  from any excessive damage that could have been caused by leaving the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">vacuum motor  21</span>  open inside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">bottom cavity  18</span>  then uses a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">connector arm  19</span>  to attach to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">battery  20</span> , which is used to power both the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">vacuum  21</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">actuator motor  16</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">battery  20</span> , like the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">vacuum motor  21</span> , is encased within a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">cavity  17</span> , which serves as a protector to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">battery  20</span> , preventing it from any possible damage. The next component in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">motor assembly  5</span>  is the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">actuator motor  16</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">actuator motor  16</span>  is connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">battery  20</span>  with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">connector arm  19</span> , which therefore allows the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">battery  20</span>  to power the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">actuator motor  16</span> . One of the benefits of the Actuated Nail Clipper is to clip nails without the need of using force exerted from hands. It uses an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">actuator  22</span>  to create the movement of clipping. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">actuating system  6</span>  includes three components that work in unison with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">actuator motor  16</span> . These components include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">helical gear shaft  23</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">nut  24</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">clipping actuator  22</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">actuator motor  16</span>  is a fan-less motor that is connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">helical gear shaft  23</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">clipping actuator  22</span>  is placed partially inside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">helical gear shaft  23</span> , while the rest of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">clipping actuator  22</span>  extends far beyond the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">helical gear shaft  23</span> . The movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">clipping actuator  22</span>  is controlled by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">actuator motor  16</span> . Since the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">clipping actuator  22</span>  is a lever that needs to reach the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">head  4</span>  so the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">actuator motor  16</span>  can work to control the movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">clipping system  13</span> , it spans from inside the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">helical gear shaft  23</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">head  4</span> . To prevent any slipping of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">clipping actuator  22</span>  from the inside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">helical gear shaft  23</span> , the connection is secured with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">nut  24</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">clipping actuator  22</span>  exerts a force on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">clipper system  13</span>  similar to how hands operate a traditional nail clipper. Another important aspect of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span>  in the Actuated Nail Clipper is the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">control panel system  8</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">control panel system  8</span>  initiates both the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">vacuum  7</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">actuating system  6</span> . The convenience of the Actuated Nail Clipper is that it is operated with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">button controls  31</span> , not force or pressure from fingers. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">control panel system  8</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">control panel platform  28</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">control panel  29</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">control panel grip  30</span> , and a plurality of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">buttons  31</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">control panel system  8</span>  is where the switches for powering on and off various features of the Actuated Nail Clipper are available. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">control panel system  8</span>  begins with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">control panel platform  28</span> , which is a protruded piece of material where the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">control panel  29</span>  is placed. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">control panel  29</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">which contains buttons  31</span>  that control various functions of the Actuated Nail Clipper, is the main user interface. Since the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">control panel  29</span>  will be operated using fingers, it is important that it is also comfortable to handle. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">control panel grip  30</span> , which is located at the base of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">control panel  29</span> , is a set of small protrusions that acts as a traction surface so the user&#39;s hand does not slip off the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">control panel  29</span> . It is important to ensure that the present invention does not fall out of someone&#39;s hands when in use. Another added feature on the Actuated Nail Clipper that can assist with grasping onto the present invention is the set of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">soft grips  9</span>  along the exterior of the body. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">soft grips  9</span>  help to add more friction on the surface to prevent slipping. These grip features make the Actuated Nail Clipper comfortable to use, for anyone. There are <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">two separate soft grips  9</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">finger grip  32</span>  for where the fingers will rest on the present invention and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">thumb grip  33</span>  where the thumb will rest on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span>  of Actuator Nail Cutter. Comfort is added to the Actuated Nail Clipper because of its shape. Since the Actuated Nail Clipper must be hand-held during its use, it is important to be sure that the present invention is designed to fit the contours of the user&#39;s hand, which will make the present invention more comfortable to use. Also, the traditional nail clipper requires force from an index finger and a thumb. Requiring only two fingers can lead to injuries because the force needed to clip nails is not evenly distributed throughout the entire hand. The common nail clipper uses a thumb and an index finger to press a bottom and top clipper together. The original method can lead to placing too much pressure on the two fingers that are important to the functionality of hands. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">The Actuated Nail Clipper&#39;s buttons  31</span> , are a quick solution to preventing any finger injuries that could result from using a traditional nail clipper. The purpose of the Actuated Nail Clipper is to make nail clipping a more comfortable and easy experience.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]    In reference to  FIG. 1   FIG. 2 , and  FIG. 10 , the next main assembly for the Actuated Nail Clipper is the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">neck  3</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">neck  3</span>  comprises of an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">exterior segment  11</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">telescopic neck assembly  10</span> . An important feature of the Actuated Nail Clipper is the ability to extend to the toes without much effort from the user. The problem with bending over to clip toe nails is that it can lead to many different injuries. The more serious of the injuries include pulling a muscle or straining the spine. Since the spine is an important but sensitive bone in the body, its injury could further develop into more injuries. The Actuated Nail Clipper can reach the toes of a person easily because of its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">neck  3</span> , and its subcomponents. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">neck&#39;s  3</span>  primary component is the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">telescopic neck assembly  10</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">telescopic neck assembly  10</span>  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">interior segment  34</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">tapered segment  35</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">straight segment  36</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">curved segment  37</span> . The interactions between the different subcomponents of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">telescopic neck assembly  10</span>  allow the consumer to extend the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">neck  3</span>  past its initial length, if needed. A long neck is useful to people who are short or inflexible and cannot reach their toes easily. However, the Actuated Nail Clipper does not neglect the rest of the population. The telescopic neck has the ability to decrease in length. It can range from fourteen inches to sixteen inches. As a result, the Actuated Nail Clipper is a convenient for anyone. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">telescopic neck  10</span>  connects to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span>  of the Actuated Nail Clipper, which ensures a more secure connection between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span>  and the neck. The first part of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">telescopic neck  10</span>  is the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">interior segment  34</span> , which is inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">exterior segment  11</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">neck  3</span> . The connection of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">interior  34</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">exterior  11</span>  segments ensures that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">neck  3</span>  is securely attached to the rest of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span> . The next part of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">telescopic neck  10</span>  is the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">tapered segment  35</span> , which is a contoured component. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">tapered segment  35</span>  is a small piece that is slightly larger at one end rather than the other. The smaller end connects to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">interior segment  34</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">tapered segment  35</span>  is contoured in its shape so it can fit with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">interior segment  34</span> , which is slightly smaller than the other components of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">telescopic neck  10</span>  because it has to be inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">exterior segment  11</span> . The other end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">tapered segment  35</span>  is attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">straight segment  36</span> , which is used to add more length to the Actuated Nail Clipper. The length of the Actuated Nail Clipper is what enables the present invention to reach toe nails as needed. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">straight segment  36</span>  also prevents the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">neck  3</span>  from being overly bent that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">head  4</span>  cannot even reach the toes properly because it acts as a support for the following segment. The length of the Actuator Nail Clipper ensures that a person can comfortably reach for their toes. Also, it is important to ensure that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">clippers (top  45</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">bottom  46</span> ) can actually reach each toe nail individually, as opposed to grabbing onto cuticles or any other side of the skin. The Actuated Nail Clipper is capable of accurately reaching the toe nail because of the slight shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">curved segment  37</span> . The curve is minimal enough that the Actuator Nail Clipper does not overreach for toe nails, or under reach. When clipping toe nails, it is important that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">top  45</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">bottom  46</span>  clippers are used properly. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">curved segment  37</span>  mimics the shape of an arm and a wrist when conventionally clipping toe nails. When using a traditional nail clipper, the hand is bent and curved so that the clipper is in the right position to clip nails. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">curved segment  37</span>  is the largest segment within the neck segment assembly. While the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">curved segment  37</span>  begins to extend straight from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">straight segment  36</span> , it becomes curved towards the end. All segments involved in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">telescopic neck assembly  10</span>  are hollow with an extra compartment in which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">vacuum tube  25</span>  can slide through. As a result, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">telescopic neck assembly  10</span>  and its subcomponents are able to maintain the shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">vacuum tube  25</span> . By doing so, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">vacuum tube  25</span>  can reach the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">head  4</span>  at one end and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">nail container  26</span>  at the other end. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">neck  3</span> , with all of its components, can then merge with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">head  4</span>  of the Actuated Nail Clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]    In reference to  FIG. 1 ,  FIG. 2 ,  FIG. 3 ,  FIG. 4 ,  FIG. 8 ,  FIG. 11 ,  FIG. 12 , and  FIG. 13 , the last main assembly for the Actuated Nail Clipper is the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">head  4</span> . This assembly consists of small subsystems, which include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">head plate assembly  12</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">clipper system  13</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">LED light  14</span> . The other main function of the Actuated Nail Clipper is that it will need to be able to do the same things as a traditional nail clipper. Therefore, it needs to have a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">top  45</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">bottom  46</span>  clipper in place that can be used to cut any toe nails. The Actuated Nail Clipper also cuts the nails in the same way that a traditional nail clipper does, by pinching the nail with a sharpened edge of both the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">top  45</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">bottom  46</span>  clippers. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">head plate assembly  12</span>  creates the structure of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">head  4</span> , which is where all the other subsystems of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">head  4</span>  are placed. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">head plate assembly  12</span>  consists of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">top plate  38</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">bottom plate  40</span> , a plurality of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">side plates  41</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">closing cap  42</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">side plates  41</span>  are parallel to each other and aligned rest on top of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">bottom plate  40</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">top plate  38</span>  rests atop the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">side plates  41</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">closing cap  42</span>  then comes in and covers one end of the hollow rectangular shape that was created by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">top  38</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">bottom  40</span> , and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">side  41</span>  plates. Since there needs to be an area for the neck to feed into the head, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">bottom plate  40</span>  is smaller than the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">top plate  38</span> . The difference in size creates a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">gap  47</span>  between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">bottom plate  40</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">closing cap  42</span> , which allows space for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">neck  3</span>  to be attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">head  4</span> . It also provides adequate space for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">vacuum tube  25</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">clipping actuator  22</span>  to reach the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">top plate  38</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">clipper system  13</span> , respectively. An added convenience to the Actuated Nail Clipper is the ability to vacuum up nail clippings that are left over from clipping toe nails. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">top plate  38</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">vacuum hole  39</span>  that provides room for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">vacuum tube  25</span>  to have access to the nail clippings because an end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">vacuum tube  25</span>  is attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">vacuum hole  39</span> . The next component in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">head  4</span>  of the Actuated Nail Clipper is the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">clipper system  13</span> . Consisting of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">top clipper  45</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">bottom clipper  46</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">clipper barrier  43</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">clipper system  13</span>  is used in junction with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">clipping actuator  22</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">clipper system  13</span>  is the part of the Actuated Nail Clipper that comes into contact with the toe nails. To be able to clip the actual nail off, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">top clipper  45</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">bottom clipper  46</span>  need to come into contact with one another with enough force that it causes the nail to break off. This is accomplished by the relationship between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">clipper actuator  22</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">clipper barrier  43</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">top clipper  45</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">clipper barrier  43</span>  is a protrusion that extends from the interior surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">top plate  38</span> . Its placement allows for it to control the movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">top clipper  45</span> , which is positioned underneath the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">top plate  38</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">top clipper  45</span>  needs to be able to come into contact with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">clipper actuator  22</span> , which is located near the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">closing cap  42</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">clipper barrier  43</span> , which extends directly perpendicular from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">top plate  38</span> , comes into contact with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">top clipper  45</span>  near the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">top clipper&#39;s  45</span>  top surface. This allows the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">clipper barrier  43</span>  to push the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">top clipper  45</span>  down at an angle, which enables the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">clipper actuator  22</span>  to come into contact with an end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">top clipper  45</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">clipper barrier  43</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">clipper actuator  22</span>  work simultaneously to control the movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">top clipper  45</span> . Unlike the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">top clipper  45</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">bottom clipper  46</span>  is kept predominately stationary. One end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">bottom clipper  45</span>  is encased in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">slot  44</span>  that is located on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">bottom plate  40</span> . As a result, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">bottom clipper  46</span>  does not move freely and disrupt the clipping action. The lack of movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">bottom clipper  46</span>  allows the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">top clipper  45</span>  to control the majority of the cutting. Another component of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">head  4</span>  is the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">LED light  14</span> . Toe nail clipping can be difficult because the lack of light that is available to shine on the toe nail. Adequate lighting can create more precise and accurate clippings. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">LED light  14</span>  not only helps to create a better working space, it also helps the user obtain a better grasp of what he or she is doing because the area is well-lit. Also, the angle at which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">LED light  14</span>  is placed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">bottom plate  40</span>  creates a way for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">LED light  14</span>  to shine on each specific nail that is being clipped at the time. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">LED light  14</span>  interacts with the way the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">head  4</span>  is positioned when clipping nails, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">because LED light&#39;s  14</span>  position is dependent on how the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">head  4</span>  is maneuvered. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">head  4</span>  is positioned so the sharp edges of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">top  45</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">bottom  46</span>  clippers can come into direct contact with the nail. This position ensures that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">LED light  14</span>  illuminates the nail that is being clipped.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]    In reference to  FIG. 15 ,  FIG. 16 , and  FIG. 17 , the dock comprises of a lofted platform, a plurality of side guards, and an indicator light. A benefit of the Actuated Nail Clipper is that it uses a rechargeable battery. To recharge the battery, the dock needs to be able to hold the Actuated Nail Clipper and convey to the consumer when the battery is finished charging. With the lofted platform and the plurality side guards, the dock can hold the Actuated Nail Clipper upright. The bottom portion of the Actuated Nail Clipper fits through the lofted platform The indicator light on the dock illustrates if the battery has completed charging or not.  </p>
