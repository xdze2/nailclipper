                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> The nail clipper contains a pair of blade bodies each having a cutting edge, a lever to be operated for bringing the cutting edges of the blade bodies into press contact with each other and a supporting shaft for linking the lever to the blade bodies; the cutting edges of the blade bodies being brought into press contact with each other by pressing the blade bodies with the lever against resilience of the blade bodies. The nail clipper is provided with bosses formed either on the lever or on the supporting shaft, so as to allow the supporting shaft to pivotally support the lever; and grooves formed on the rest of the supporting shaft and the lever, with which the bosses are engaged. Each groove has a mouth portion through which the boss is engaged and disengaged, a guiding portion capable of pivotally supporting the boss, and a connecting portion connecting the mouth portion and the guiding portion to each other. The groove has a pair of side wall surfaces opposing each other in the mouth portion, connecting portion and guiding portion and also a bottom surface connecting the side wall surfaces to each other. </p>

                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates to nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A conventional nail clipper, for example, as shown in Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Publication No. Sho 61-82502 has a supporting shaft which is notched to form a bearing hole, and a connecting pin attached to a lever is inserted to the bearing hole. In this nail clipper, although the lever can be incorporated into the supporting shaft easily by virtue of the bearing hole opening to the periphery of the shaft, this configuration per se involves problems that the connecting pin of the lever easily slips off the bearing hole of the supporting shaft and that the strength of the portion of the supporting shaft around the bearing hole is lowered. In addition, it is troublesome to form a supporting shaft having such a shape of bearing hole as described above.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is an objective of the present invention to provide nail clippers, capable of facilitating incorporation of a lever, ensuring bearing of the lever and enhancing the strength of the supporting section. It is another objective of the present invention to provide a nail clipper whose supporting shaft can be molded easily.  </p>

The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lever  12</span>  is forked at the distal portion to form a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">supporting arms  13</span>  and also a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">bearing recess  14</span>  between these <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">two supporting arms  13</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper end portion  11</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">supporting shaft  7</span>  is inserted to this <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">bearing recess  14</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">Each supporting arm  13</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lever  12</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper end portion  11</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">supporting shaft  7</span>  are linked to each other in a supporting section S.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Materials of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">Supporting Shaft  7</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">Lever  12</span>    </p>
                    
                        <p>      Both the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">supporting shaft  7</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lever  12</span>  are integrally molded respectively with a synthetic resin material. The synthetic resin material is based on polyamide, polypropylene or aromatic nylon and can contain a predetermined filler. As the filler, a glass fiber, a mineral fiber or a carbon fiber can be used singly, or a combination of at least two of the glass fiber, mineral fiber and carbon fiber may be used. Provided that the content (wt %) of such fillers is Î±, the value Î± is defined in this embodiment as 15%â‰¦Î±â‰¦65%. However, it is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> preferably 40</span>%â‰¦Î±â‰¦60%.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The following characteristics can be obtained by utilizing such synthetic resins.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      (1) Synthetic resins have high strength and high rigidity after wetting or at high temperatures, high impact strength and high elongation at break as rigid materials and excellent fatigue strength, so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">shaft  7</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lever  12</span>  come to have high strength and rigidity.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      (2) Synthetic resins have good fluidity and provide good appearance, since they can be subjected to injection molding at a mold temperature of 80 to 110Â° C. and since dies, screws and cylinders do not wear much; and  </p>
                    
                        <p>      (3) Synthetic resins do not wear much when they are brought into contact with metallic materials to improve wear resistance of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">shaft  7</span>  and of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lever  12</span> .  </p>

In this state, the resilience of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">upper blade body  1</span>  is borne by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">bosses  15</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">grooves  16</span>  formed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">shank  10</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">supporting shaft  7</span>  through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">supporting arms  13</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lever  12</span> ; whereas the resilience of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lower blade body  2</span>  is borne by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">head  8</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">supporting shaft  7</span> , maintaining the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">upper cutting edge  3</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">lower cutting edge  4</span>  to be spaced away from each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Next, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lever  12</span>  is pivoted on the upper side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">upper blade body  1</span>  by 180Â° together with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">supporting shaft  7</span>  and then inverted to be positioned over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">upper blade body  1</span>  so as to form an upward slope with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">blade body  1</span> , as shown in FIG.  7 ( a ) illustrating the state where the nail clipper is ready for use. Then, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">upper blade body  1</span>  is pressed with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lever  12</span>  against the resilience of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">lower blade bodies  1</span>  and  2 , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">upper cutting edge  3</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">lower cutting edge  4</span>  are brought closer and abutted against each other, as shown in FIG.  7 ( b ) illustrating the state where the nail clipper is in action.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In any of the states described above, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">bosses  15</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lever  12</span>  move within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">guiding portions  18</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">respective grooves  16</span>  defined in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">supporting shaft  7</span>  following the movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lever  12</span> .  </p>
