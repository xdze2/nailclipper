                        <p>  Application filed November 14, 1902. $eria11lo. 131,329. (No model.) 7   </p>
                    
                        <p>  T0 on whom it may concern.-   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Be it known that I, ERNST KAUFMANN, a subis constructed after the manner of small&#34; tweezers or nippers, but which by reason of the shape of one leg allows of a gentle out being made without requiring any considerable exertion of power. The said leg is also made on its inner side as a nail-file or nail-cleaning implement, so that the improved implement is suitable for the complete care of the nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   One method of carrying this invention into effect is illustrated, by way of example, in the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a view in front elevation of the implement in the closed condition. Fig. 2 is a view in side elevation thereof. Fig. 3-is a similar view showing the cutter in an open position; and Figs. 4 and 6 are views in front elevation outside and inside, respectively, showing the file or cleaning-toolgturned up. Fig. 5 is a view in side elevation of Figs. at and 6,and Figs. 7 and 8 are views from above of the cutting-jaws in the closed and opened posi tions, respectively. 1   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Throughout the views like parts are marked with like letters of reference.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In the construction shown the nail-cutter is provided with inclined and conically-bent cut-y ting-faces w and y; but this particular. construction is not a distinguishing feature of the invention, because they may also be formed The small jaws which carry the cutting-faces 0c and y are extended in the form of levers or arms and are pivoted together by means of ahinge s. The leg of the jaw y is shorter than the opposite leg and has pivoted to it&#39;in a slot a, Fig. 1, the lever h. This lever has its upper part pivoted on the pin t, formed with awedgeshaped nose, while its lower part is formed internally as a file and .its free end as a nail scraper or cleaner. The free end of the leg belonging to the jaw&#39;y is acted on by a forked spring f, which is fixed to the leg of the jaw 00 by means of small screws m and n, the said spring being so arranged as to have a tendency to continually move the jaws away from each other.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The pivoted lever h in moving from the open position, Fig. 3, into the closed position, Fig. 2, will cause the lower ends of the legs belonging to ac and y to be moved away from each other by reason of. the higher back of the nose of the lever h coming in between them, so that the jaws are thereby moved toward each other and the spring f is placed under further tension. When the nail-cutter is in the closed state, it is secured by means of a loop or catch &#39;0, which is movably connected at p to the .leg of the jaw w and which is slipped over a groove in the lower end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> lever 72</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Thus to use the nail-cutter the catch &#39;0 is opened out of the position shown in Fig. 2 in be now situated undermost, then-the cutter will be again in its open position, but so as to cause. the spring f to look, as it were, the lever h in .that position, Fig. 5. The lever h is thus locked in position to serve as a file,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  and ihmaythen be used as such, as also with its free .end, that is now situated uppermost, asa nail cleaning or scraping device.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The forked shape of the spring f is neces saryin&#39;order to, allow of suitably mounting the lever h. This-rmproved implement for the nails, notwithstanding its extremely effective action, fis of such small dimensions that it can be easilyhcarriedin the waistcoat pocket or thfe like. 1 c   </p>
                    
                        <p>   What I claim ,&#39;*an desireto secure by Letters Patent of&#39;th tedastates, is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> I 1</span>. A device of the classidescribed comprising pivotally-connectedf legs&#39;having cuttingjaws at one end, one of saidleg&#39;s being shorter than the other, saidshor&#39;if&#39;er leg being bifur cated, a lever pivoted between the resultant spaced portions of the shorter leg, said lever having a cam disposed for engagement with the opposite leg and movable to engage portions at opposite sides of its point of greatest eccentricity and a spring constructed and arranged to hold the legs yieldably against the action of the cam, said lever being provided with nail-treating devices.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2. A device of the class described comprising pivotally-connected legs having cuttingjaws at one end, one of said legs being shorter than the other and bifurcated to form spaced portions, the ends of said spaced portions being beveled, a lever pivoted between the spaced portions and having a cam disposed </p>
