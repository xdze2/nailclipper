                        <p>  Application filed April 8, 1912. Serial No. 689,376.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, HARLAN E. EGKLER, a citizen of the United States, residing at Elyria, in the county of Lorain and State of Ohio, have invented a new and useful Improvement in Cuticle-Clippers, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention relates to a cuticle nipper and the principal object of the invention is to provide a nipper having an improved type of cutting jaw which is so constructed that the cuticle at the top of the finger nail can be easily out.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object of the invention is to so construct the cutting jaw that an elongated finger will be formed which not only forms a portion of the edge, but will also form a device by which the finger nails can be cleaned.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object of the invention is to pro vide a cuticle nipper which is simple in con struction and which has an improved operating-means by which the jaws may be held in a closed position when desired.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   VVit-h these and other objects in view this invention consists of certain novel combinations, constructions and arrangements of parts as Will be hereinafter fully described and claimed.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the accompanying drawing: Figure 1 is a top plan view of the clipper. Fig. 2 is a side elevation of the cuticle clipper in a closed position. Fig. 3 is a side elevation of the cuticle clipper in an open position. Fig. 4 is a perspective view of the operating lever.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention comprises a strip of re silient material which is doubled intermediate its length to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> form t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">wo jaws 10 and 11</span></span>, which aws extend substantially parallel and have their free ends formed into heads of an improved construction. Each of these<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> heads 12</span> is provided with a side extension forming a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> tapered finger 13</span> which finger extends beyond one side of the jaw as clearly shown in Fig. l. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cutting edge 14</span>; of each is curved from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> point 15</span> to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> outer end 16</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> finger 13</span> thereby forming a cutting edge which conforms to the shape of the cuticle at the inner end of the nail, so that the cuticle can be readily cut. An<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> operating lever 17</span> has its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> turned up end 18</span> pivotally connected with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> pivot cars 19</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> jaw 10</span> and engages the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaw 11</span> so that the cutting edges may be brought together from the position shown in Fig. 3 to that shown in Fig. 2. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> inner face 20</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> lever 17</span> is roughened to form a finger nail file and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> free end portion 21</span> is curved slightly and provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> roughened outer face 22</span> by means of which the finger will be prevented from slipping from the lever when operating the clipper. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> catch 23</span> is carried by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaw 11</span> and engages the free end portion of the lever, as shown in Fig. 2 to hold the lever in the proper position to hold the cutting edges in contacting relation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Then this device is in use, the lever is released from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> catch 23</span> and will assume the position shown in Fig. 3. The cutting edges will then be normally in spaced relation and the cuticle can be very easily cut, after the cuticle has been engaged by the cutting edges the lever is pressed and the edges will be brought together, thus cutting the cuticle from the finger. If it is desired to file the finger nails the lever can be turned to bring the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> roughened face 20</span> downwardly and the finger nail can then be easily filed. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> finger 13</span> can be used for cleaning the nails when the cutting edges are in contacting relation, as shown in Fig. 2. When the clip is not in use, the free end of the lever is engaged by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> catch 23</span> and the clip can then be carried in the pocket without danger of the clip catching in the pocket and tearing the lining.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  \Vhat is claimed, is:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A cuticle nipper comprising a pair of jaws formed from a single strip of resilient material doubled intermediate its length whereby the jaws will extend substantially parallel in spaced relation, a head at the Free end of each of said jaws, each of said heads being extended to form a tapered finger extending beyond one side of the jaw and having an arcuate outer edge curving outwardly from one side oi. the jaw to the end of the elongated linger, pivot cars carried by one of said jaws, and an operating lever pivotally connected with said pivot ears and engaging the remaining jaw for operating said cuticle nipper.   </p>
