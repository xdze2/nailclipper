                        <p> An improved pair of scissors comprises two opposing and pivotally connected sharp-edged blades configured to allow cutting a nail of a toe or a finger, wherein at least one blade comprises at least one guard configured to lie between a tip of the finger or toe and a bottom of the nail, when the finger or toe tip rests on a blade comprising a guard, and a tip of the nail is placed between the blades. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    Scissors are a hand-operated cutting instrument used for cutting various thin materials, such as paper, plastic, cloth, rope and wire.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0002]    There are many types of scissors and shears for different purposes. For example, shears used to cut metal or to trim shrubs must have very strong, sharp blades. Children&#39;s scissors, used only on paper, have dull blades and rounded corners to ensure safety.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    Scissors used to cut hair, finger nails and toe nails must be very sharp. This creates a problem when the scissors are used by adults to trim babies&#39; and children&#39;s finger and toe nails, as an accidental slip of the adult&#39;s hand may result in injuring the baby&#39;s finger.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    U.S. Pat. No. 3,812,868 titled ‚ÄúGUARDED FINGER NAIL CLIPPERS‚Äù to Francis J. Keating describes a nail clipper having front or side guards for protecting the user from cutting the soft skin of his fingers or toes. The front guard member with a curved surface is adjustably coupled to the lower jaw member by a hold-down clamp. The side guards push back the skin around the sides of the nails. Clippers, however, may not be the preferred cutting instrument for trimming infants&#39; finger and toe nails, for example some users may have difficulties in safely manipulating the narrow small levers because of poor finger dexterity, large fat fingers, arthritis etc, and poor visibility because clippers tend to obstruct the view of the nails to be cut. Such users will prefer to use scissors. However, the multiple adjustable guards for the clipper described in Keating are not suitable for the sliding action of scissor blades.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    The need remains, therefore, far scissors capable of safe, accurate nail trimming. Embodiments described herein below address this need.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0006]    According to one aspect, an improved pair of scissors is provided, comprising two opposing and pivotally connected sharp-edged blades configured to allow cutting a nail of a toe or a finger, wherein at least one blade comprises at least one guard configured to lie between a tip of the finger or toe and a bottom of the nail, when the finger or toe tip rests on a blade comprising a guard, and a tip of the nail is placed between the blades.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    In some embodiments each guard substantially extends along a blade.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    In some embodiment each of the blades comprises a guard.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    Preferably, guards of a first blade oppose guards of a second blade, i.e. they face away from each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    In some embodiments, each guard has a rounded profile.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    In some embodiments, e.g. in some for cutting babies&#39; nails, each guard has a height of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> approximately 1</span> mm.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    In some embodiments, e.g. in some for cutting babies&#39; nails, each guard is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> approximately 1</span> mm from a blade edge.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]    In some embodiments the blades are metal.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0014]    In some embodiments the guards are metal.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0015]    In some embodiments the blades are casted.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0016]    In some embodiments the blades are made of cold setting materials.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0017]    In some embodiments a distance between a base of the guard and an edge of a blade is variable.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0018]    For example, the guard is wave shaped.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]    In some embodiments guards are each on level or almost on level with an edge of said blades.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]    In some embodiments, e.g. in scissors for children, tips of the blades are blunt.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE SELECTED EMBODIMENTS  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0034]    Various embodiments of improved scissors for safe, accurate nail trimming are disclosed hereinbelow. Embodiments of the improved scissors comprise at least one guard placed upon at least one of the pivoted blades of the scissors.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0035]    In preferred embodiments, the blades are extremely sharp and tension sprung‚Äîto increase the cutting and shearing tension only at the exact point where the blades meet. The hand movement (pushing with the thumb, pulling with the fingers in right handed use) can add to this tension.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0036]    Reference is made to  FIG. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">1  illustrating prior art scissors  10</span>  having <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">scissor blades  12</span>   a  and  12   b  pivotally coupled such that their <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">sharpened edges  14</span>   a  and  14   b  slide against each other when the handles (not shown) opposite to the pivot are closed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0037]    Reference is made to  FIG. 2  illustrating an exemplary embodiment of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">improved scissors  100</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">Blades  112</span>   a  and  112   b  have <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">sharpened edges  114</span>   a  and  114   b  similar to the prior art shown in  FIG. 1 ; however, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">blades  112</span>   a  and  112   b  are provided with an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem118">elongat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">ed guard  118</span>   b  (guard  116</span>   a  cannot be seen in  FIG. 2 ) that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">runs along blade  112</span>   b  on its outer side, adjacent to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">sharpened edge  114</span>   b. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem118"> Elongated guard  118</span>   b  preferably has a rounded profile and has a diameter of roughly one millimeter or any other diameter suited to guard a fingertip, as will be demonstrated below. Any other profile can be used for the elongated guard without limiting the scope of the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0038]    The fingernails should not be cut too little to prevent a baby from hurting itself and others with extremely sharp nails; neither should they be cut too much, as the nail protect the finger tips and over cutting might injure the finger tips.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0039]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem118">distance  118</span>   b  between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">sharpened edge  114</span>   b  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">blade  112</span>   b  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">elongated guard  116</span>   b  may be fixed or alternatively adjustable and is preferably designed to provide cut fingernails having optimal lengths. In the embodiment shown in  FIG. 2 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem118">distance  118</span>   b  is fixed, and is approximately one millimeter.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0040]    Other embodiments may have other distances and guard diameters or shapes to allow cutting the nails to optimal lengths, according to the size of the individual whose nails are cut, the nails of which fingers/toes are cut etc. Some embodiments may have more than one guard or guards with varying dimensions to suit various nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0041]    The elongated guard can be provided to the blade using different methods such as soldering, welding, adhering the guard to the blade, erosion or machining of the blade surface so as to form the guard, drop forging or casting of the blades. Those methods are provided only as exemplary methods and by no means limit the scope of the present invention. During manufacture, blanks of the blades are typically also trimmed to remove excess metal, hardened by rapid heating and cooling and tempered. The blade edges may be typically ground and polished as is known in the art.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0042]    In order for the scissors to cut smoothly, the blades should meet at two points only. These two points are the swivel (the point where the rivet or screw connects the blades) and the cutting point. The cutting point moves from just beyond the swivel to the tip as the scissors are closed. The blades are prevented from meeting at any other points by giving them a slight horizontal and vertical curve away from each other during manufacture.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0043]    Reference is made to  FIG. 3  showing a side cross-sectional view of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">blades  112</span>   a  and  112   b  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">improved scissors  100</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">Elongated guards  116</span>   a  and  116   b  are located on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">blades  112</span>   a,    112   b  respectively parallel and adjacent to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">edges  114</span>   a  and  114   b. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem118"> Distances  118</span>   a  and  118   b  between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">corresponding edges  114</span>   a  and  114   b  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">elongated guards  116</span>   a  and  116   b  are also shown.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0044]    In some embodiments (not shown), the guards may be close to or level with the blade edges, to help prevent accidental injury from the sharp blades by baby hands etc.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0045]      FIG. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">4  illustrates improved scissors  100</span>  in action in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">human finger  30</span>  having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">fingertip  32</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">finger nail  34</span>  with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">nail tip  36</span>  is placed between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">blades  112</span>   a  and  112   b  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">improved scissors  100</span>  in order to cut off the edge of the nail. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0046]    Fingertip  32</span>  is shown to rest on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">blade  112</span>   b  such that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">elongated guard  116</span>   b  lies between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">fingertip  32</span>  and the bottom of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">finger nail  34</span> , and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">nail tip  36</span>  is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">placed beneath edge  114</span>   a  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">above edge  114</span>   b.  In this position, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">nail tip  36</span>  is ready to be cut by the pivotal action of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">sharp edges  114</span>   a,    114   b  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">blades  112</span>   a,    112   b. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116"> Elongated guard  116</span>   b  prevents slipping of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">nail tip  36</span>  from its optimal position, thus precluding accidental cutting or harming the delicate skin of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">fingertip  32</span>  by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">both sharp edges  114</span>   a  and  114   b.     </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0047]    Some embodiments will, have blunt or ‚Äòround‚Äô blade tips for safety.  FIG. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">5  illustrates improved scissors  200</span>  in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">improved scissors  200</span>  are shown to have <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">blades  212</span>   a,    212   b  with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem216">elongated guard/s  216</span>   a  running respectively along and adjacent to the edges of the blade/s, and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem213">rounded blade tips  213</span>   a,    213   b.     </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0048]      FIG. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">6  shows scissors  300</span>  with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem312">blades  312</span>   a  and  312   b, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem314"> edges  314</span>   a  and  314   b,  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem316">wave shaped guide/s  316</span>   a,  that may afford improved grip and fit of the finger and fingernail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0049]    Integrating elongated guards within scissor blades contributes to overall child safety in nail scissors which requires particularly sharp edges for cutting nails. Using the scissors presented herein forces the cushion of the finger slightly away from the sharp end of blades by the elongated guard.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0050]    Some embodiments have only one guard on only one blade. In preferred embodiments, both blades have guards, to allow safe use by both right-handed and left-handed people.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0051]    According to another aspect, the scissors are part of a kit that further comprises other apparatuses for fingernail care, for example one or more nail files having abrading material of one or more coarseness, or referring to  FIG. 7 , a nail trimmer apparatus that is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">a small handheld battery powered device  400</span>  that trims nails without damaging the surrounding skin. A trimming action is driven by a compact motor at a predefined speed and torque and a mechanism converts the rotation of a motor shaft to an oscillating action at a head. A cushioned abrasive surface attached to the head oscillates with a frequency and stoke that optimizes the trimming of the nail while not adversely affecting surrounding skin. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">device  400</span>  is particularly useful in blunting babies&#39; fingernails after being cut by the scissors, as the newly cut fingernails may be extremely sharp.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0052]    As shown the trimming method includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem401">trimming apparatus or device  401</span> , which includes a variety of features. Such features include an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem403">oscillating surface  403</span> . Such surface is mounted on a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem405">hand held member  405</span> . The hand held member directs the oscillating surface to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">nail  34</span>  of an infant&#39;s finger, which is on the infant&#39;s hand. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem409">infant&#39;s hand  409</span>  and hand held member are held by a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem411">adult hands  411</span> ,  413  such as those from the infant&#39;s mother or father. One hand holds and directs the hand held member while the other hand holds the infant&#39;s hand and finger.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0053]    Embodiments may be used to safely cut nails of babies, children, adults and animals. Sizes and distances described herein are for illustration only and should not be looked at as limiting.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0054]    The scissors blades are usually made of metal, preferably steel, preferably carbon steel. However, some embodiments may comprise zirconium oxide. The guards may be made of the same material as the blades, or of another matrial. The scissors are typically coated against corrosion. In some made embodiments, the blades or coatings further comprise nickel and/or chromium.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0055]    The scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and includes both combinations and sub combinations of the various features described hereinabove as well as variations and modifications thereof, which would occur to persons skilled in the art upon reading the foregoing description.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0056]    In the claims, the word ‚Äúcomprise‚Äù, and variations thereof such as ‚Äúcomprises‚Äù, ‚Äúcomprising‚Äù and the like indicate that the components listed are included, but not generally to the exclusion of other components. </p>
