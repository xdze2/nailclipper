                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> An apparatus comprises a housing having a shape and size suitable for being held in a single hand of a user. A nail file head is coupled to the housing. An electric drive device is contained within the housing and configured to rotationally oscillate the nail file head about an axis. An abrasive surface is coupled to the nail file head configured to trim or smooth a fingernail or toenail when the nail file head is oscillated. The abrasive surface extends around and faces radially away from the axis. </p>

                        <p>        [0020]    Motorized nail files are used to apply a moving abrasive surface to a finger or toe nail. Oscillating tools are able to accomplish this task while lessening the potential of physical damage (e.g., cuts, bleeding, bruising) to surrounding skin. Motorized nail files are particularly useful to trim nails of others including pets, children, the elderly, patrons at a salon and the infirm. A motorized nail file is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,188,628, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.  </p>
