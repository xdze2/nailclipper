                        <p>   Int. Cl. A4511 29/02 US. CI. 30-28 16 Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE This disclosure pertains to clippers having a pair of acituating members. In one of the embodiments the actuating members are geared together and each is secured to a spring for pivotal rotation with respect thereto by a pin. The spring is housed within the two actuating members and is wider at its base than at its top so that when its base portion is squeezed, cutting surfaces provided on the base are moved toward each other to perform a cutting operation. Cam surfaces are provided on the inner portions of both actuating members so that upon upward pivotal rotation of the actuating members the cams will engage the spring at four places and, due to the geared connection between the actuating members, provide an equal force distribution on the spring to move the cutting surfaces together to perform the cutting operation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In another embodiment of the invention a cam ring is placed over the cutting spring and each of the actuating members are geared to the cam ring to press it downwardly over the spring upon upward pivotal movement of the actuating members so that the cutting surfaces on the base of the spring are moved toward each other. The cam ring and the cutting spring may also be provided with flared portions to provide a second cutting edge or, alternatively, a gripping device upon pivotal movement of the actuating members.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another embodiment discloses a cutting ring having a U shaped member extending therethrough for connecting one arm to each of the actuating members. The actuating members are geared together and through a cam surface compress the ring to perform a cutting operation upon vertical pivotal movement of the actuating members.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the invention The field of this invention is basically cutting devices and more particularly such devices used to clip fingernails and the like.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Description of prior art The prior art involves a standard fingernail clipper which utilizes a pair of cooperating cutting blades forced into operation by a lever anchored on a pin extending through the blades. When the lever is in the open operating position and the clippers are in the hand of the user, having been placed in such position by tediously flipping the lever over through 180 and then pivoting the lever back through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180"> same 180</span>, pressure is applied by the thumb of the user and, being at an angle, often results in pivoting of the lever away from its completely open operating position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Furthermore, after the cutting operation is effected and the operating lever is again flipped over through 180 and rotated back through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180"> same 180</span> to the closed position, sharp edges of the clipper remain exposed so that they may fear the pocket or the pocketbook of the user.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  See   </p>
                    
                        <p>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a small, compact cutting device or fingernail clipper which is always in the open position ready for use (thus not requiring the tedious fixation or cocking of the clipper). The invention involves theuse of a pair of actuating members which encompass a spring having cutting edges on the base thereof. The actuating members are each secured to the base of the spring by a pin so that the two actuating members can pivot upwardly to move the cam surfaces positioned internally of the actuating members into engagement with the legs of the spring member to move the cutting surfaces toward each other. The actuating members may be geared together with one or more teeth (directly or through a third member) so that the vertical pivotal movement of the actuating members provides an equal forced distribution on the cutting spring.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another feature of this invention is the embodiment wherein a cam ring fits over the cutting spring in a noose like fashion to squeeze the cutting surfaces of the spring together upon downward movement of the ring caused by vertical pivotal movement of the actuating members. A second cutting surface and/or a gripping means may be provided on the cam ring and the flared surface of the spring so that the two are forced into engagement upon vertical pivotal movement of the actuating members.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another embodiment of the invention utilizes a cutting ring held adjacent the actuating members by a U shaped member having a leg secured to each actuating member for pivotal movement so that upon pivotal movement of the actuating members (which are geared to each other), a cam surface compresses the ring to move a pair of cutting surfaces on the ring together.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   These and other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.   </p>

                        <p>   Thus, it is apparent that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> spring member 38</span> is wider at the base than it is at its upper portion and that when pressure is applied upon the side of the spring member adjacent the base, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> cutting surfaces 52</span> and 54will be moved toward each other against the resiliency of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> spring<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> legs 4<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">0, 42 a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">nd 44, 46</span></span></span></span>. The lower portion of each of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> spring<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> legs 4<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">0, 42 a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">nd 44, 46</span></span></span></span> is provided with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> aperture 56</span> extending therethrough.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> Apertures 58</span> are also provided in each of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> bifurc<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ations <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">22, 24 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">and 26, 28</span></span></span></span> of the actuating members. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> apertu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">res 56 and 58</span></span> are aligned so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> legs 4<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">0 and 42</span></span> of the spring member are positioned between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> bifurc<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ations 22 and 24</span></span> and receive a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> cylindrical pin 60</span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> similar cylindrical pin 62</span> extends through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> aligne<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">d apertures 56 and 58</span></span> so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> legs 4<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">4 and 46</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> spring member 38</span> are accommodated between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> bifurc<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">ations 26 and 28</span></span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> actuating member 12</span>. The ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> pins 6<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">0 and 62</span></span> are then secured against axial movement in any suitable manner, such as that shown in FIGS. 3 and 5. It is now apparent that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ing members 10 and 12</span></span> are each secured to one side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> spring member 38</span> with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> gear t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">eeth 30<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">, 34 an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">d 32, 36</span></span></span></span> in engagement. Thus, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ing members 10 and 12</span></span> are free to pivot vertically upwardly about the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> pins 6<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">0 and 62</span></span> which are held in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> spring member 38</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Cam means is provided in association with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ing members 10 and 12</span></span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> spring member 38</span> to move the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">g surfaces 52 and 54</span></span> of the spring member together upon vertical pivotal movement of the actuating members. More particularly, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> inner surfaces 64</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> bifurc<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ations <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">22, 24,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> 26 and 28</span></span></span></span> are each provided with a curvature such that the surface above the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> apertures 58</span> extends inwardly with respect to the surface of the bifurcations below the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> apertures 5</span> 8.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In operation of the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the cutting device is carried in the position shown in FIG. .2 with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">g surfaces 52 and 54</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> spring member 38</span> totally encompassed by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ing members 10 and 12</span></span> and thus not subject to tearing the pocket of the user. It should be noted that when the cutting device is taken from the pocket and placed in the hand it is immediately read for use. There is no pivotal movement or cocking of the device required to place it in position for operation. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ing members 10 and 12</span></span> are grasped along the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> serrat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">ions 16 and 18</span></span> between the thumb and fingers of the user and the fingernail to be clipped is placed between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">g surfaces 52 and 54</span></span>.

As the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> base p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">ortions 14 and 16</span></span> move upwardly, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> cam surfaces 64</span> on the internal surface of the bifurcations pivot downwardly and provide pressure along the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> legs 4<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">0, 42, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">44 and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">46</span></span></span></span> to squeeze the base of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> spring member 38</span> together so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">g surfaces 52 and 54</span></span> can perform the clipping operation. It should be noted that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> gear t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">eeth 30<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">, 32, 34</span></span></span>, and 36 being engaged in pairs, force the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ing members 10 and 12</span></span> to move upwardly an equal arcuate distance thus insuring that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> cam surfaces 64</span> on each of the bifurcations provide an equal force on the legs of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> spring member 38</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   When the thumb and the fingers are released the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ing members 10 and 12</span></span> pivot downwardly from the position shown in FIG. 4 and return to the position shown in FIG. 2. Again, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">g surfaces 52 and 54</span></span> are housed within the actuating members to facilitate carrymg.   </p>

                        <p>   The operation of the embodiment shown in FIG. 6 is similar to that as shown in the previous embodiment. Vertical pivotal movement of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ing members 10 and 12</span></span> cause the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> cam surfaces 64</span> to apply pressure down the surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> spring member 38</span> at four points to force the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">g surfaces 52 and 54</span></span> together. The single gear tooth connection between the mating bifurcations insures that an equal force distribution is provided.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Third embodiment (FIGS. 7-11) Referring now more particularly to the embodiment of the invention shown in FIGS. 71l, a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> like a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">ctuating members 72 and 74</span></span> are provided of stamped construction. Each of the actuating members is composed of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> two si<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">de sect<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">ions 76<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82">, 78 and 80, 82</span></span></span></span> respectively. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> side s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">ections 76 and 80</span></span> are angularly disposed with respect to their<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78"> integr<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82">al side sections 78 and 82</span></span> with the side sections being joined solely by the creased top. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">ing members 72 and 74</span></span> are each provided with a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84"> feet 8<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem86">4 and 86</span></span>, respectively, which form the base of the actuating members.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem88">   </p>

                        <p>   Spring means in the form of a generally flat base with a pair of upward extending steeples is adapted to be positioned between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">ing members 72 and 74</span></span>. More particularly, the spring member indicated generally at 104 has upwardly a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">ngularly extending integrally formed legs 106</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> similar legs 108</span> spaced therefrom. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> legs 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">06 and 108</span></span> are integrally connected at their bottom by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> base s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">ections 110 and 112</span></span> which extend between the legs. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> base s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">ections 110 and 112</span></span> terminate on their inwardly extending portions in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> honed <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">cutting edges or surfaces 114 and 116</span></span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> base s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">ections 110 and 112</span></span> also extend outwardly from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> legs 106</span> to provide flared stops for a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem118"> cam ring 118</span> now to be described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem118"> cam ring 118</span> is of generally rectangular boxshaped construction which is adapted to be seated over the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> legs 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">06 and 108</span></span> of the spring member. The internal dimensions of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem118"> cam ring 118</span> are such that it may freely fit over the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> legs 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">06 and 108</span></span> of the spring member for a portion of the height of the legs. However, the base of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> legs 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">06 and 108</span></span> are normally separated a greater distance than the internal dimension of the box like cam ring so that when the cam ring is forced to its lower position with the bottom surface engaging the outwardly extending flared base of the spring member, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> spring<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> legs 106 and 108</span></span> are squeezed together forcing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">g surfaces 114 and 116</span></span> toward each other.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   To effect upward and downward movement of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem118"> cam ring 118</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120"> towers<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122"> 120 and 122</span></span> extend upwardly from the side walls of the cam ring and each is provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124"> depres<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">sions 124 and 126</span></span> on opposite sides thereof to receive the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem92"> tooth-<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem94">like projections 92 and 94</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">ing members 72 and 74</span></span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   To secure the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">ing members 72 and 74</span></span> to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104"> spring member 104</span> while permitting vertical pivotal movement of the actuating members,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem128"> apertu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130">res 128 and 130</span></span> are provided in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> spring<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> legs 106 and 108</span></span> adjacent the upper portion thereof and are aligned with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem96"> eyes 96</span> and &#39;98 of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">ing members 72 and 74</span></span> respectively.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem132"> Pin me<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem134">ans 132 and 134</span></span> extend through the aligned apertures and are suitably secured against axial movement.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In operation, the cutting device is normally carried in the position shown in FIG. 8 wherein the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104"> spring member 104</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem118"> cam ring 118</span> are positioned between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">ing members 72 and 74</span></span> with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">g surfaces 114 and 116</span></span> completely shielded. When the cutting device is placed between the thumb and the fingers of the user it is immediately ready for use to clip the fingernail or other object placed between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">g surfaces 114 and 116</span></span>. The user merely squeezes the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">ing members 72 and 74</span></span> along the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> serrat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">ions 100 and 102</span></span> to cause vertical pivotal movement of the outer ends thereof. Such vertical pivotal movement causes the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem92"> tooth-<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem94">like projections 92 and 94</span></span> extending from the head of the actuating members to force the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem118"> cam ring 118</span> downwardly over the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> spring<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> legs 106 and 108</span></span> against the bias thereof to move the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">g surfaces 114 and 116</span></span> toward each other to perform a cutting operation. Upon release of pressure on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">ing members 72 and 74</span></span>, the resiliency of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> spring<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> legs 106 and 108</span></span> causes the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem118"> cam ring 118</span> to move to its upward position thus returning the actuating members from the position shown in FIG. 10 to the original position shown in FIG. 8. From the foregoing it is apparent that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">ing members 72 and 74</span></span> are, in effect, geared together through their connection with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124"> cam ri<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">ng depressions 124 and 126</span></span> causing equal arcuate movement of the actuating members and a corresponding balanced downward movement of the cam ring to provide equal force distribution on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> spring<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> legs 106 and 108</span></span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Fourth embodiment (FIGS. 12 and 13) Referring now more particularly to the embodiment of the invention shown in FIGS. 12 and 13, a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem136"> like a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem138">ctuating members 136 and 138</span></span> are provided with a contoured back surface having<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140"> serrat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem142">ions 140 and 142</span></span> for gripping purposes. A pair of parallel<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem144"> protru<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem146">ding head portions or bifurcations 144 and 146</span></span> extend from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem136"> actuating mem<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem148">ber 136<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150"></span> while similar bifurcations 148 and 150</span></span> protrude from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem138"> actuating member 138</span>. The terminal portion of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem146"> bifurc<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem148">ations 146 and 148</span></span> are identical with each having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152"> depression 152</span> whereas the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem144"> bifurc<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">ations 144 and 150</span></span> terminate in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem154"> tooth-like projections 154</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem154"> Opposite projections 154</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152"> depressions 152</span> are adapted to be received in mating engagement.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A spring member indicated generally at 156 is adapted to be accommodated between the bifurcations of the actuating members. More particularly, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem156"> spring member 156</span> is an integrally formed member having upwardly e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem158">xtendin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem160">g angularly positioned paired legs 158 and 160</span></span> spaced apart from each other, The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem158"> legs 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem160">58 and 160</span></span> are connected by a base portion which has an outwardly flar<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem162">ed upwardly extending horizontal shoulder 162</span> on one side of the legs. Approximately midway between the ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem162"> should<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem164">er 162</span> vise-like teeth 164</span> are provided. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem164"> teeth 164</span> are adapted to cooperate with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem166"> teeth 166</span> provided on the bottom of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem168"> cam surface 168</span>. of a cam ring indicated generally at 170.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   On the other side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem156"> spring member 156</span> the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem158"> legs 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem160">58 and 160</span></span> are also connected by a base portion which is flared outwardly and bent upwardly but in this case a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem172"> honed cutting surface 172</span> is provided along the terminal edge. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem172"> cutting surface 172</span> cooperates with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem174"> cutting surface 174</span> provided on the bottom edge of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem176"> cam surface 176</span> provided on the other side of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem170"> cam ring 170</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The cam ring is of rectangular configuration and has the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem168"> previo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem176">usly described cam surfaces 168 and 176</span></span> secured along the sides thereof. The cam ring has internal dimensions such that it may be freely fitted over the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem158"> legs 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem160">58 and 160</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem156"> spring member 156</span>.

                        <p>   A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> spring ring 204</span> somewhat elliptical in configuration s adapted to be positioned beneath the barrel sections of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem196"> :he ac<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem198">tuating members 196 and 198</span></span>. Curved tabs extend nwardly from one side of the spring ring and terminate In<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> honed <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">cutting surfaces 206 and 208</span></span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> spring ring 204</span> has<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210"> four apertures 210</span> extending therethrough. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212"> U-shaped rod 212</span> has<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214"> one leg 214</span> extending through two )f the apertures in the spring ring while the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem216"> other leg 216</span> :xtends through the other two apertures of the spring ring. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214"> leg 214</span> of the U-shaped rod extends into a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem218"> lrilled recess 218</span> in the under surface of the barrel portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem196"> actuating member 196</span> and has an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem220"> eye 220</span> which is aligned with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem222"> eye 222</span> in the actuating member. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem224"> pin 224</span> extends through the aligned eyes and is secured against axial movement. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem216"> other leg 216</span> of the U-shaped rod extends into a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem226"> drilled recess 226</span> provided in the under surface of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem198"> actuating member 198</span> and has an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> eye 2</span>.28 which is aligned with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem230"> eye 230</span> provided in the actuating member. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem232"> pin 232</span> extends through the aligned eyes and is secured against axial movement.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In operation, the cutting device is placed between the thumb and the fingers which grasp the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem234"> serrations 234</span> on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem196"> actuating member 196</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem236"> serrations 236</span> on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem198"> actuating member 198</span>. When the hand is squeezed, the actuating m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem224">embers <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem232">pivot vertically upward about pins 224 and 232</span></span>. Thus, the forward ends of the actuating members pivot arcuately downwardly so that<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem238"> cam surfaces 238</span> provided on the under surface of the barrel portion of the actuating members apply pressure against the cam surfaces of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> spring ring 204</span>. Accordingly, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> spring ring 204</span> is compressed from the position shown in FIG. 15 to that shown in FIG. 17 wherein the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">g surfaces 206 and 208</span></span> are brought into engagement to perform the cutting operation. Upon release of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem196"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem198">ing members 196 and 198</span></span>, the resiliency of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> spring ring 204</span> forces the actuating members to their original position as shown in FIG. 15. As with the other embodiments of this invention, the geared connection between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem196"> actuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem198">ing members 196 and 198</span></span> insures a balanced force distribution on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> spring ring 204</span> to insure a proper cutting operation.   </p>
