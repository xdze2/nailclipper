                        <p>  Application May 12, 1954, Serial No. 429,156   </p>
                    
                        <p>  10 Claims. (Cl. 30-142) This invention relates to a combination pocket knife and nail clipper.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is an object of the invention to provide a pocket knife with a nail clipper without reducing the size of the knife blades. In other words, having in mind that the average man does not want a bulky knife and nail clipper, but does want a knife with at least one fairly good size knife blade and nail clipper, it is desired to utilize normally lost space in the knife casing to accommodate the nail clipper.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object is to provide the nail clipper with shielding elements at the side edges of its cutting elements whereby when the device is not being used there will be no danger of the cutting elements snagging the users clothes, as for example when it is deposited in a mans pocket.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object is to construct the unit out of a minimum number of parts by forming both side plates of the knife housing out of a single sheet of material.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A further object is to provide the nail clipper with a lever (for bringing the cutting elements together) which needs no latch for holding it in retracted position against the face of the clipper.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object is to provide a combination pocket knife and clipper in which the clipper-biasing lever is made as a flat member without a hump portion to project beyond the face of the knife; whereby the device will not be unduly bulky when deposited in a mans pocket.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Other objects of this invention will appear in the following description and appended claims, reference being had to the accompanying drawings forming a part of this specification wherein like reference characters designate corresponding parts in the several views.   </p>

                        <p>   Slits at 24 and 2<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">5 (Fig. 4) are made in l</span>iner plate 3 to provide a spring arm 26, norm<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">ally lying in </span>the plane of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">the plate. Hol</span>e 27, cut in arm 26, receives mounting post<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> 22 and </span>notch 11<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">, cut i</span>n<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> plate 3, receives rectang</span>ular<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> peg 10. </span>The free<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> edge of</span> <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">the spring arm is turned dow</span>n at 28 and provided with a sharp cutting edge 29.

                        <p>   It w<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">ill be seen </span>that since plate 3 and sp</span>ring arm 26 are positioned<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> adjacent the </span>rela<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">tively short b</span>lade 14 the spring arm is fr<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">ee to be moved toward plat</span>e 4 without striking a kni<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">fe blade. It is possible</span> therefore to incorporate the nail clipper into the knife without having to increase the length, Width or thickness thereof.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The modified construction shown in Figs. 6 through 11 includes a stamping 60 having two plates 61 and 62 interc<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">onnected by </span>a neck <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">portion<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> 63. Plate 61 </span></span>is slit at 64 and 65<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem63"> to provide a sp</span>r<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">ing arm 6</span>6 having a sharp cutting edge 67. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">Projecting fro</span>m one edg<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem67">e of plate 61 is a lar</span>ge tab 68 having tabs 69 and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">70 extend</span>ing t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">herefrom.

                        <p>   Although no knife blades are shown it is contemplated that two knife blades (and hence two knife Springs) will be provided. In order to reduce the thickness of the knife no partition plate is provided between the knife springs. The reader will note that neck portion 63 is wider in the area adjacent <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem63">plate 61 than in</span> the area adjace<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">nt plate 62. The narrow</span> neck portio<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">n will allow clearance </span>for a relatively long knife blade while the wide neck portion will strengthen the neck and at the same time allow clearance for a relatively short knife blade.   </p>
