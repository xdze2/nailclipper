Other objects of the invention will become apparent from the following description and claims, and from the following drawings, in which: Figure 1 is a side elevation of one form of manicuring device embodying the present invention and showing the mode of operation of the device. Figure 2 is a perspective&#39;view of the device shown in Figure l with the various parts thereof detached from one another.   </p>

                        <p>   Figure 6 is a plan view of part of the completed element shown in Figure 4, the view being taken in the manufacture of the article presents a novel and striking appearance.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Each body part is of substantially disc-like configuration comprising a fiat inner face l3 of annular configuration, the peripheral edge of each face being largely of part-circular con-&#39; figuration as indicated at [4, each such peripheral edge being formed adjacent the face l3 and medially of the circumferential length of such edge with a recess IS, the base of which recess is formed with an arcuate groove l6 disposed a short distanceinwardly of the peripheral shown at<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> I 8</span>.   </p>

                        <p>   Referring firstly to Figures 1 to 3 of the draw,- ings, the manicuring device there illustrated comprises a body ll! of relatively flat and largely circular configuration, the body consisting of two identical body parts ll, 52, each conveniently formed by moulding the same in a suitable plastic, the two parts forming each body being moulded in a material of the same colour but preferably of dissimilar colours, for example, one a white-colour, and the other a red, green or other contrasting colour, so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> assembled .diametrically handle portion 25</span>, the two handle portion being &#34;along the length of parts are brought together edge l4, each groove being adapted when the parts are assembled, to receive one of the two longitudinal edges I! of the elongated-part-cir cular strip metal nail-cutting element which is Each body part II, I2 is formed adjacent the recess IS with a number of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> circular holes I 9</span> spaced apart equidistantly and symmetrically therecess, the edge of each of such holes which is more remote from the centre of the body part merging into the recess [5 so that this is&#39;interrupted at positions corresponding to each hole l9, while each hole l9 extends inwardly of the body part beyond the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> inner wall 20</span> of the groove l6.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   These holes l9 serve to permit of egress of the nail parings during the operation of the device.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Each body part I I, I2 is formed centrally on its fiat face [3 with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> circular recess 2</span>| so that when the two parts are assembled, the two re-&#39;- cesses 2i collectively provide a housing as shown in Figure 3, in which &#39;a spare cutting element indicated at 22 in that figure may-be disposed with the element bent to a curvature greater than its natural curvature shown in Figure 2; so as to engage resiliently with the circular wall of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> recesses 2</span>| and thereby to be retained in position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   For &#34;securing the two body partstogether, the annular flat face l3 thereof is provided in each case with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> upstanding connecting pin 23</span> of 1 slightly tapered configuration, each pin being adapted frictionally to engage within a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> corre spondingly tapered recess 24</span> when the two body with the fiat faces l3 thereof face toface with one another. To facilitate operation of the device, each body part is formed on its periphery at a pOsition opposite to therecess IS with a thus brought into overlapping relationship with 7 one another when the two parts are assembled f together, and the opposed faces of these. handle portions are formed near the outer edge thereof with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> recesses 26</span> so thumb nail of the user the that by the insertion of the rebetween, the two body parts can be forced apart to permit when necessary of the removal and replacement of the of the user so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> pins 23</span> engage frictionally with their<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> corresponding recesses 24</span>,- thus effectively securing the parts together against movement when the device of use.   </p>
