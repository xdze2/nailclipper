                        <p>  12 Cl</span>aims. (Cl. 30-143) The present invention relates to combination implement assembly and, more particularly, to -such an implement assembly wherein knife-like and nail clipper implements are assembled within a casing.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel combination implement assembly wherein a knifelike implement and nail clipper implement are combined with a casing to provide a relatively compact unit characterized by highly attractive appearen-ce and ease of operability.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object is to provide such an assembly wherein the body of the assembly provides sturdy gripping for wielding a knife blade pivoted into operative position extending outwardly therefrom.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  , Still another object is to provide such an assembly wherein a, pair of implements having housings with pivotably mounted elements therein are combined with a nail clipper implement to provide an attractive appearance and are each easily operable.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Other objects and advantages will be readily apparent from the following detailed specification and attached drawing wherein:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIGURE l is a perspective View of a combination implement assembly having a nail clipper and knife implement with a knife blade extended into operative position;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIGURE 2 is a sectional view to an enlarged scale along the line 2 2 of FIGURE l;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIGURE 3 is a fragme<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ntary p</span>erspective view ofanother combination implement assembly embodying the present invention with the nail clipper operating lever elevated slightly to reveal the construction thereof;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIGURE 4 is a perspective view of a three i-mplement assembly embodying the present invention having the pair of tweezers and knife-blade thereof extending into operative position; and   </p>
                    
                        <p>  . FIGURE 5 is a sectional view to an enlarged scale along the l-ine 5 5 of FIGURE 4.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It has now been fou<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">nd that </span>the foregoing and related objects may be readily attained in a combination implement assembly with a casing unit having a pair of spaced generally parallel extending face portions of sheet material and means along one side edge of the face portions joining the face portions together. Within the casing unit at the opposite side edge of the face portions is a knife-like implement which generally includes a knife blade and possibly one or more additional blades pivotally mounted within an elongated housing of generally U-shaped cross-section opening outwardly of the casing unit at the opposite side edge. The housing of the implement is secured within the casing unit with the generally parallel side wall portions thereof extending adjacent the face portions and its connecting base portion facing the joining means but being spaced therefrom to define a pocket therebetween. In this manner, the blade or blades of the implement may be pivoted outwardly of the housing and casing unit into operative position extending generally longitudinally of the housing.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  j SlidablyV seated within the pocket of the casing unit is a nail clipper having a pair of superposed elongated cutter jaw elements havin-g `cooperating cutter jaws at one end thereof and fastened together at the other end thereof. The jaw elements are biased apart in the operative position to provide yieldable spacing between the cutter jaws for clipping fingernails and the like, and a pivot pin is located intermediate the length of the jaw elements and adjacent the cutter jaws. Pivotably mounted on this pivot pin is an elongated operating lever which extends genarally longitudinally of the jaw elements. In the normal or at rest position of the nail clipper in the assembly, the major portion of the jaw elements including the other or fastened end is slidably received within the pocket defined by the casing unit and knife-like implement, andthe operating lever extends along the outer surface of one of the casing unit face portions. To limit pivotal movement of the lever laterally of the casing unit and sliding movement of the clipper relative to the casing unit, the lever and adjacent face portion are provided with interengaging means which may be disengaged by movement of the lever generally normally outwardly from the face portion.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The casing unit and clipper are cooperatively dimensioned and configured so that the clipper lits snugly within the pocket defined between the joining means of the casing and the base portion of the knife-like implement housing. In this manner, the casing unit will be relatively rigid in the hand of a user to provide sturdy gripping for wielding a knife blade pivoted into operative position and thereby permit effective application of pressure despite the use of relatively exible sheet material for the casing unit face portions.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In one embodiment of the present invention preferred from the standpoints of economy and ease of fabrication, the casing unit is provided simply by folding a piece of leather or like flexible sheet material so that the folded portion provides the joining means between the front and back face portions. In another embodiment, it is possible to add another type of implement having a housing of similar -generally U-shaped cross-section to which one end of two separate pieces of sheet material providing the face portions are secured and which thereby acts as the joining means of the casing unit and pocket defining element thereof. In this manner, a second knife-like implement, tweezers, or other type of tool may be coupled in a convenient assembly.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  , Although various types of interengaging means may be employed, generally it is desirable to have a positive mechanical interlock provided by a projection on lever and a recess in the face portion, or vice versa. The projection on the operating lever may be providedby .a separate pin, button or lug inserted into an `appropriate recess or aperture or otherwise aixed to the lever or casing member, or it may be formed integral with the lever as a lug at an edge thereof or a lug or dimple staked out of the body thereof. The recess is desirably dimensioned to receive theprojection relatively snugly and desirably is provided by an aperture in the casing member face portion which is eyeletted to avoid tearing or other injury to the sheet material.   </p>

Received pivotably within the housing of the implement 60 is a pair of tweezers 70&#39;. Th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">e casing unit</span> 2a and the i<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">mplements 10</span>a and 60 are cooperatively dimensioned with respect to the nail clipper 32 so as to receive the nail clip<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">per 32 snugly wi</span>thin the pocket defin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">ed thereby and t</span>hus provide a relatively rigid unit when gripped by the user.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   If so desired, the configuration of the casing unit and various i-mplements may be readily varied so long as the desired cooperation to achieve relatively snug fitting of the nail clipper is maintained. Moreover, the face portions of the casing unit may be adhesively bonded to the housing of the implements in addition to or in place of the eyelets, or other fastening and securing means may be employed.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In any of the several illustrated embodiments, it can be seen that the snug fitting of the clipper Within the pocket ensures a relatively rigid casing unit for firm wielding `of the knife blade. The clipper is maintained in its seated position by the interengaging means to prevent inadvertent disassembly, and undesired pivoting of the operating lever within a users pocket is effectively precluded by the biasing pressure of the clipper elements which maintain the lever in its engaged position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Thus, it can be seen that the present invention provides a novel combination implement assembly wherein knife &#39;and nail clipper elements are combined within a casing to provide a relatively compact unit characterized by highly attractive appearance and ease of operability. The body of the assembly defined by the casing provides sturdy, relatively rigid gripping for wielding a knife blade pivoted outwardly therefrom and, if so desired, a pair of housed pivoted implements may be combined with the nail clipper.   </p>
