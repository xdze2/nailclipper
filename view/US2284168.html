                        <p>  7 Claims.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My invention relates to tools, instruments, and the like. More particularly the invention concerns an improvement in devices such as nail files, knives, awls, scissors, saws, keys, and the like hand operated tools wherein the device is retractably sheathed in the handle of the tool.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Anobject of this invention is to provide a tool or instrument of the type aforesaid, wherein the tool is retractable longitudinally of the handle or sheath of the tool in which it is fastened when not in use. This not only protects the tool and working surfaces thereof, but where the tool is carried in the pocket of clothing, fabric, or when packaged or otherwise covered, the sharp surfaces of the tool or instrument are prevented from contacting the adjacent covering and damaging the same.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object of this invention is to provide a unitary constructed tool wherein the working tool member is arranged to be positively engaged and forced out of or retracted into the handle or sheath portion thereof.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Another object is to provide an improved device of this character wherein the working blade or tool may be extended to one or more positions and locked against&#39;movement&#39; after so positioning.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object is to provide a hand tool of pleasing appearance and in which can be interchangeably mounted difierent kinds of tool blades, as desired.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Still another object-is to provide an instrument comprising a working tool member which can be readily manipulated by the hand to unlock the blade and move it into position for use,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Figure 6 is an enlarged detail sectional view taken on the line 6-6 of Figure Figure 8 is a cross sectional view taken on&#39; the line 8-8 of Figure &#39;7;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 9 is a similarcross sectional view as shown in Figure 8, illustrating a modification wherein the working tool member is detachable from the handle member;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 10 is a pictorial View of a portion of the handle member shown in Figures 1 and 2, wherein a positive locking means is provided for retaining the working tool in retracted position in the handle; 7   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figures 11, 12 and 13 illustrate the various types of instruments or working tools which are adapted for use with this invention;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 14 is a pictorial view of a fragmentary portion of a tool made according to my invention wherein a spring pressed button member is employed for positioning the tool blade;   </p>
                    
                        <p>  &#39; Figure 15 is a vertical section view of the form shown in Figure 14, illustrating the particular arrangement of the parts of this improved construction.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  and whereby the instrument is automatically locked in position upon release of pressure against the tool blade moving member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A further object is to provide a retractable tool of improved construction wherein a spring pressed button, attached to the tool blade and slidably retained in the sheath-like handle, forms the means for moving and holding the tool blade firmly in any desired position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In the accompanying drawings:&#39;   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Figure 1 is an enlarged pictorial view of a nail Referring to the drawings in detail, the numeral l designates the tool handle or sheath portion of the device, which may be made of synthetic plastic materials, synthetic resin, shell, bone, glass, ivory, wood, metal, or any other suitable-material. v The working tool member 2 is secured tothe handle <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">I so as to be reciproc</span>able forward and backward through an opening 3 formed in one end of the handle port<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">ion l.
