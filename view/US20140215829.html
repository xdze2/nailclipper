                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A safety nail clipper for safe and fast cutting of the nails of a pet or wild animal can include a nail clipper body, a cutting implement, and a funnel, such that the funnel can guide a pet nail to a cutting location. Alternatively, a safety nail clipper can include a top piece, a top blade, a bottom piece, a bottom blade, and a funnel, such that the funnel guides a pet nail to a cutting location, where the top and the bottom blades meet when the top and bottom pieces are pressed together. Additionally, a safety nail clipper with a funnel can further include a safety stop, which serves to stop the nail from entering too far past the cutting location, to avoid cutting into the quick of the nail. </p>

                        <p>        [0001]    This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/760,255, filed Feb. 4, 2013.  </p>

                        <p>      FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    The present invention relates generally to the field of nail cutting devices for cats, dogs, and other pets.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0003]    Dogs and many other pets need to have their nails cut. However, most pets dislike having their nails cut. They will often become scared and agitated, and may struggle and wriggle, making it very tricky to use the traditional scissor and guillotine-style nail clippers. With one slight movement, the clippers can accidentally cut into the quick of the nail, causing pain, bleeding, and risking infection.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    Consequently, most pet owners dread nail-cutting time. They face a difficult choice of either leaving it to professionals, such as vets and groomers, which is costly and time consuming, or doing it at home and saving the money and time, but risking hurting their pet.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    There are nail clippers that are advertised as safe. Some, such as the original Millers Forge clippers and others like them, have a so-called safety bar. Its purpose is to aid in cutting the pet&#39;s nails at a safe length without getting too close to the quick.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    Others are of the Dremel type. Here, the safety feature is a rotating file that shaves away the tip of the pet&#39;s nail. One such device on the market is the Peticure, another is the original Dremel.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    Then there is the Quickfinder range of nail clippers. The safety feature is a patented technology that senses the pet&#39;s quick and signals when it is safe to cut. Red light signals that the clipper is over the quick, yellow light that the clipper is near the quick, and green light that it is safe to cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    But all types have limitations: The safety bar type necessitates the nail being led through to the very small area that is the safety bar. But a struggling and wriggling pet can make this difficult. Amid the furor, the nail easily ends up in the hollow area immediately next to the cutting hole. Here, incorrectly positioned, the nail will be cut in a skewed way that can cause injury. The fact that the nail clipper is advertised as safe increases this risk, because the owner operates in the mistaken belief that the clipper is foolproof safe, and so may cut too hastily and arbitrarily.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    With the Dremel type, the risk of cutting the quick is eliminated, but injury can still ensue if the nail is filed too far. This battery-driven clipper is also quite expensive, and some pets do not react well to the vibration and noise. Yet their greatest problem is that they take a long time, as filing takes much longer than cutting. However, most dogs will not cooperate and stand still for the  10  minutes or more it takes to use the clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    With the Quickfinder type, the instruction is to move the clipper slowly up the nail so the scanner can detect the change in the LED&#39;s. However, with the typical resisting pet, it is difficult to keep the paw steady for a sufficient amount of time. It is similarly problematic that the pet&#39;s nail has to be positioned precisely in the clipper. Another problem is that the sensor has to be “on”, meaning that the handles have to be kept partially squeezed while the nail is inserted. This, too, is awkward when trying to control a squirming pet.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    Many users also report that the technology is ineffective; that the sensor detects the quick too quickly or too late. This merely gives a false sense of security. It is also often observed that the clipper does not cut cleanly through the nail, and may crush or split the nail. In addition, it may not be sturdy enough, causing the cutting blade to twist away from the portion of the blade that the nail fits through.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    As such, considering the foregoing, it may be appreciated that there continues to be a need for novel and improved devices and methods for cutting the nails of a pet.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0013]    The foregoing needs are met, to a great extent, by the present invention, wherein in aspects of this invention, enhancements are provided to the existing model of nail clippers for pets.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0014]    In aspects of this invention, a safety nail clipper for pets can include unique safety features, comprising: </p>
                    
                        <p>        a. a funnel, which helps guide the pet&#39;s nail to a cutting-style nail clipper, placed near the inside end of the funnel, or immediately adjacent to the end of the funnel, which is met by   b. a safety stop behind the cutting-style clipper. This safety stop ensures that it is not possible to cut off more of the pet&#39;s nail than the equivalent of the distance between the cutting-style clipper and the safety stop behind the cutting-style clipper.        </p>
                    
                        <p>   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0017]    In aspects of this invention, the safety nail clipper for pets uniquely solves the problems associated with current nail clipper devices because: </p>
                    
                        <p>        a. It is a cutting-style nail clipper, which means it is quick acting, but in contrast to the current cutting-style nail clippers, there is no area or hole in which the nail can mistakenly end up.   b. It includes a funnel, which ensures that the pet&#39;s nail is quickly and safely guided towards the cutter, so that there is nowhere else for it to go, and the nail is held still and steady at the desired place.   c. It includes a safety stop behind the cutter, to ensure that it is impossible to cut off more of the nail, than permitted by a safe distance between the cutter and the safety stop.   d. The cutting-style technology is lower-cost to manufacture and maintain, than Dremel and Quickfinder type clippers.   e. It emits no vibration or noise that can aggravate a pet.        </p>

                        <p>          [0023]    These factors combine to make the safety nail clipper for pets a simultaneously quick, effective, convenient, cost-effective, no-vibration, no-noise, painless and uniquely safe solution for pet owners, groomers and vets to cut pets&#39; nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    Pet owners, and groomers and other professionals can benefit from using the safety nail clipper for pets to cut or trim their pets&#39; nails or claws because they can rest assured that the safety nail clipper for pets will </p>
                    
                        <p>        a. help regulate the length and evenness of their pets&#39; nails or claws;   b. operate quickly, effectively, conveniently, cost-effectively, without any vibration or noise, painlessly and safely.        </p>

                        <p>        [0039]    Before describing the invention in detail, it should be observed that the present invention resides primarily in a novel and non-obvious combination of elements and process steps. So as not to obscure the disclosure with details that will readily be apparent to those skilled in the art, certain conventional elements and steps have been presented with lesser detail, while the drawings and specification describe in greater detail other elements and steps pertinent to understanding the invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0040]    The following embodiments are not intended to define limits as to the structure or method of the invention, but only to provide exemplary constructions. The embodiments are permissive rather than mandatory and illustrative rather than exhaustive.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0041]    Throughout this disclosure, a cutting-style nail clipper shall be understood to mean existing guillotine-style clippers, scissor- or plier-style clippers, opposing-blade clippers with a compound lever, and other type of clippers with a cutting element that includes at least one blade, which is designed to cut the nails of a pet with a swift cutting action.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0042]    In the following, we describe the structure of an embodiment of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">safety nail clipper for pets  10</span>  with reference to  FIG. 1 , in such manner that like reference numerals refer to like components throughout; a convention that we shall employ for the remainder of this specification.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0043]    In an embodiment, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">safety nail clipper for pets  10</span> , can comprise: </p>
                    
                        <p>        a. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">top piece  22</span> ,   b. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">top blade  16</span> , which is connected to, or a part of the front end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">top piece  22</span> ,   c. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">bottom piece  24</span> ,   d. A bottom blade,  18  which is connected to, or a part of the front end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">bottom piece  24</span> ;   e. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">funnel  12</span> , which is positioned such that a front aperture of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">funnel  12</span>  is in front of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutting location  20</span> , which is the cutting line formed when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">top piece  22</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">bottom piece  24</span>  are pressed together, so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">top blade  16</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">bottom blade  18</span>  are in contact, along a line constituting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutting location  20</span> ; and   f. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">safety stop  14</span> , which is located behind the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutting location  20</span> ;        </p>
                    
                        <p>   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0050] <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">   Whereby </p>
                    
                        <p>        (1</span>) a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pet nail  26</span>  can be led into and through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">funnel  12</span> , such that the shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">funnel  12</span>  helps guide the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pet nail  26</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">safety stop  14</span> , that forms a wall preventing further entry, so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">tip  28</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pet nail  26</span>  comes to an automatic stop, simultaneously leaving the quick of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">nail  30</span>  at a natural stop before reaching the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutting location  20</span> , and subsequently;   (2) when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">top blade  16</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">bottom blade  18</span>  are pressed together they meet at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutting location  20</span> , and in this process cut through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pet nail  26</span>  between the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">pet nail  28</span>  and the quick of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">nail  30</span> , leaving the quick of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">nail  30</span>  untouched and safe, such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">safety stop  14</span>  ensures that it is not possible to cut off more of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">pet&#39;s nail  24</span>  than the equivalent of the distance between from where the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">top blade  16</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">bottom blade  18</span>  come together at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutting location  20</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">safety stop  14</span> , which acts as a wall preventing further entry, behind the cutting-style clipping action.        </p>
                    
                        <p>   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0053]    In related embodiments, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">top piece  22</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">top blade  16</span>  can be of identical shape, construction and size as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">bottom piece  24</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">bottom blade  18</span> , whereby the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">safety nail clipper  10</span>  is top-bottom symmetrical, or substantially symmetrical, so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">top piece  22</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">top blade  16</span> , can be referred to as respectively the first piece, and the first blade, and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">bottom piece  24</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">bottom blade  18</span> , can be referred to as the second piece, and the second blade.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0054]    In related embodiments, the combination of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">safety stop  14</span>  and the position of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutting location  20</span>  means that it is impossible to cut off more of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">pet&#39;s nail  24</span>  than the equivalent of the distance between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">safety stop  14</span>  and the position of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutting location  20</span> . This very significantly reduces or eliminates the risk of cutting off too much of a nail, thereby cutting into the quick of the nail, causing pain, bleeding and possible infection.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0055]    In a related embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">top piece  22</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">bottom piece  24</span>  can be pivotally connected via a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">connection point  50</span> , which can be a connection pin, or some other common fastening mechanism allowing pivotal rotation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">top piece  22</span>  relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">bottom piece  24</span> . The connection pin can be located in the back ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">top piece  22</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">bottom piece  24</span> , opposite to the respective locations of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">top blade  16</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">bottom blade  18</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0056]    In related embodiments, the combination of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">funnel  12</span>  and the cutting-style clipper as constituted by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">top blade  16</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">bottom blade  18</span>  coming together, also means that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">safety nail clipper for pets  10</span>  can be uniquely quick acting. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">funnel  12</span>  allows for a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">pet&#39;s nail  24</span>  to be quickly and seamlessly guided to the quick-acting cutting-style clipping action, which significantly reduces the stress caused to the pet, and which makes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">safety nail clipper for pets  10</span>  far easier and more efficient to use on the pet.  </p>
