                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> An angler&#39;s utility tool that includes a line cutter and a sharpening stone has been developed to facilitate hook and lure exchanges. The angler&#39;s tool includes a first planar member, a second planar member, a lever arm, and a sharpening stone. The first planar member has a first end and a second end with the first end of the first planar member terminating into a first jaw. The second planar member has a first end and a second end with the first end of the second planar member terminating into a second jaw. The second ends of the first and the second planar members are joined to one another. A fulcrum pin extends through the first ends of the first and the second planar members. The lever arm is pivotally and rotationally mounted to the fulcrum pin, and the sharpening stone is mounted to the covering layer covering the portion of the second planar member. The sharpening stone may include a groove in a longitudinal edge to enable hook point sharpening. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> TECHNICAL FIELD  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    The tool described below relates to fishing tackle, and, more particularly, to fishing tackle used by sporting and recreational anglers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    Most sporting and recreational anglers carry a tackle box with them. The tackle box contains supplies and tools that facilitate the setup of the fishing equipment and transitions between setups that may be necessary in light of encountered conditions. For example, most tackle boxes include various sizes of hooks, weights, and lures along with one or more pliers, screwdrivers, and sharpening stones. To change lures, for example, the knot that secures a lure currently being used may require cutting of a knot in the line to free the lure. To add the next lure to the line, the line must be threaded through the wire loop extending from the lure and an appropriate knot is then tied in the line to secure the lure to the line. Excess line must then be trimmed from the knot so the knot does not disturb the presentation of the lure in the water. Many anglers also examine the hooks attached to the lure to discover the condition of the hook points or barbs. Frequently, the points and barbs require reshaping with a sharpening stone to repair the barb or point.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    During the above-described process, retrieval of the various tools needed to change the lure may be complicated by the organization of the tools in the tackle box as well as any pitching of the boat in which the angler is situated. Frequently, clippers resembling fingernail clippers are used to snip existing knots or to trim line from knots. The clippers are then returned to the tackle box so a search for a sharpening stone can commence. Once found, the sharpening stone is cradled in the angler&#39;s hand while the hook or hooks of the lure are stroked across the stone to apply an edge to the hook points or barbs. Transitions between tools provide opportunities for tools to be dropped onto a bank or into water or a boat. These transitions also take time and for some sporting anglers, the time spent changing equipment setups over the course of a day can make the difference between a frustrating day or a productive day. Consequently, tools that facilitate fishing tackle changes are beneficial.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0004]    An angler&#39;s utility tool that includes a line cutter and a sharpening stone has been developed to facilitate hook and lure exchanges. The angler&#39;s tool includes a first planar member, a second planar member, a lever arm, and a sharpening stone. The first planar member has a first end and a second end with the first end of the first planar member terminating into a first jaw. The second planar member has a first end and a second end with the first end of the second planar member terminating into a second jaw. The second ends of the first and the second planar members are joined to one another. Alternatively or additionally, a similar covering layer may be applied to the lever arm. A fulcrum pin extends through the first ends of the first and the second planar members. The lever arm is pivotally and rotationally mounted to the fulcrum pin. The sharpening stone is mounted to a bottom surface of the second planar member. Preferably, the sharpening stone is mounted to bracket, which is mounted to the second planar member with a securing member, such as a screw. The sharpening stone may also include one or more grooves in its longitudinal edge or edges to enable hook point sharpening.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0013]    One embodiment of a utility tool that enables an angler to cut fishing line and sharpen hooks is shown in a perspective view in  FIG. 1 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">tool  10</span>  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">anvil component  14</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lever arm  18</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">sharpening stone  20</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">anvil component  14</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">first planar member  24</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">second planar member  28</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">two planar members  24</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> 28  terminate into jaws  30</span>  and  34 , respectively. Near the jaws, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">fulcrum pin  38</span>  extends through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">planar members  24</span>  and  28 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">fulcrum pin  38</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">flange  40</span>  ( FIG. 2 ) at one end that abuts a lower surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span>  to prevent the fulcrum pin from passing through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span> . As shown in  FIG. 3 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">fulcrum pin  38</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">pivot fitting  44</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">fulcrum pin  38</span>  is press fitted into an aperture near the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">jaw  34</span>  in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span>  to secure the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">fulcrum pin  38</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0014]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">planar member  24</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">bend  48</span> . The portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">planar member  24</span>  that extends from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">bend  48</span>  to the end in which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">jaw  30</span>  is formed diverges angularly from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span> . This angular deviation enables the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">two jaws  30</span>  and  34  to be separated from one another so material, such as fishing line may be placed between the jaws. Another portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">planar member  24</span>  extends from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">bend  48</span>  in a direction that is relatively parallel to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span> . The parallel portions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">planar members  24</span>  and  28  may be joined to one another. These parallel portions may be joined to one another using a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">rivet  68</span> , as shown in  FIG. 1 , or they may be sonically welded or soldered together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0015]    The portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span>  that extends from the junction of the two parallel portions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">planar members  24</span>  and  28  to a position near the edge of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">flange  40</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">fulcrum pin  38</span>  may be overlaid or wrapped in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">covering layer  50</span> . The covering layer provides a grip surface that is more easily grasped than a smooth surface. In one embodiment, the covering layer is made of neoprene, although other tacky materials may be used to facilitate gripping of the tool. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">covering layer  50</span>  may encircle a portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span>  to help ensure the covering layer remains attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span> . Alternatively, the covering layer may overlay only the lower surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span> . In other embodiments, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">covering layer  50</span>  may overlay or be wrapped around a portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lever arm  18</span>  as shown in  FIG. 1  and  FIG. 2 . In the embodiment in which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">covering layer  50</span>  surrounds a portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">shim  54</span>  may be placed between the two parallel portions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">planar members  24</span>  and  28  to compensate for the thickness of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">covering layer  50</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">shim  54</span>  may be as long as the parallel portions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">planar members  24</span>  and  28 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0016]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">sharpening stone  20</span>  may be a sedentary sharpening stone, commonly known as an Arkansas stone, or a manmade stone having a similar grit and abrasiveness. Such stones are available, for example, from Source International of Louisville, Ky., although other sources of natural and manmade stones may be used. As shown in  FIG. 4 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">sharpening stone  20</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">groove  60</span>  that extends along at least one longitudinal edge of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">stone  20</span> . This groove facilitates the sharpening of hook ends in the groove. As depicted in the figure, the stone may be constructed with a groove along each longitudinal side of the stone. One of the grooves may be V-shaped while the other groove may be U-shaped, although other groove configurations and combinations may be used. The diversity in the shape of the grooves enables different types of strokes and repair actions to be taken with regard to hooks and other implements. While the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">stone  20</span>  may be mounted to the lower surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span>  with adhesive or the like, it is preferably mounted to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">covering layer  50</span>  by adhesive or the like.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0017]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">planar member  24</span>  is shown in a side view in  FIG. 2  with further attention to the mounting of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lever arm  18</span>  in  FIG. 3 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">planar member  24</span>  includes an aperture through which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">fulcrum pin  38</span>  may extend upwardly from the planar member. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">rivet  68</span>  may be used to join the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">planar member  24</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span> . Thus, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span>  may also include an opening to receive the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">rivet  68</span> . If a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">shim  54</span>  is used in the construction of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">anvil component  14</span> , it may also include an opening to receive the rivet. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">rivet  68</span>  may also include an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">opening  72</span>  to receive a lanyard or the like so the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">utility tool  10</span>  may be secured to structure. Alternatively, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">planar members  24</span>  and  28  may be joined directly to one another or with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">shim  54</span>  interposed between them without using a rivet. In this embodiment, the planar members and shim may be formed with openings that are aligned before securing the components to one another to provide an opening for a lanyard or other securing member, such as a plastic tie or the like.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0018]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lever arm  18</span>  is shown in a side view in  FIG. 2 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lever arm  18</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90">bend  90</span> , which provides a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem86">support  86</span>  for the lever arm when the arm is in position to leverage the two jaws towards one another as shown in the figures. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem88">front portion  88</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lever arm  18</span>  also includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem94">opening  94</span>  ( FIG. 1 ) that fits within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">fulcrum pivot fitting  44</span>  ( FIG. 3 ). A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem98">fulcrum rocker  98</span>  provides a fulcrum point for leveraging the jaws towards one another as shown in  FIG. 2 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">rear portion  84</span>  ( FIG. 1 ) may include at least one and, preferably, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem92">two slots  92</span>  and  96  that extend across a portion of the width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lever arm  18</span> . These slots may receive eyelets on lures or other screw mounted structures so the lever arm may be operated as a wrench to turn the eyelet or other screw mounted structure. If two slots are provided, they preferably have different widths to accommodate different gauge sizes of wire used to form eyelets or other screw mounted structure. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">reamer  100</span>  may extend from the rear of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lever arm  18</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">reamer  100</span>  is provided to open or widen eyelet openings or other line receiving structure. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">reamer  100</span>  may be implemented with a conical or triangular point. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">reamer  100</span>  may be located within a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">U-shaped recess  104</span> , as shown in  FIG. 1 , to help center the eyelet or other structure for mating with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">reamer  100</span> . The U-shaped recess may also be used to disgorge hooks from fish.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lever arm  18</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">planar members  24</span>  and  28 , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">fulcrum pin  38</span>  may be constructed from metal, such as cold rolled carbon steel or stainless steel. The metal may be finished with a corrosion resistant finish, such as a parkerized or anodized finish, as know in the metal treating art. Preferably, these components are not chrome plated. The covering layer may be neoprene or other foam or plastic material. The covering layer may be adhesively bound to the metal surfaces of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar arm  28</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lever arm  18</span> . Although the embodiment depicted in the drawings includes a covering layer about the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lever  18</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lever arm  18</span>  may be provided without the layer in conjunction with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span>  being at least partially encased in a covering layer.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]    While the embodiment depicted in the figures includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124">knife blade  124</span> , which is housed between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">planar members  24</span>  and  28 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">tool  10</span>  need not have a knife blade. In embodiments having a knife blade, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">rivet  68</span>  also passes through an orifice in one end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124">knife blade  124</span>  to form a pivot for the knife blade. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">planar member  24</span>  may have a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem128">curved recess  128</span>  formed in it to provide access to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem134">groove  134</span>  or other structure that may be formed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124">knife blade  124</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem134">groove  134</span>  may be grasped or otherwise engaged by a person&#39;s fingernail to further facilitate manipulation of the knife blade. One or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">other planar members  24</span> ,  28  may also be formed with a tab or other structure on the side opposite the side in which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem128">recess  128</span>  is located to act as a stop. The stop helps keep the blade within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">anvil  14</span>  when it is not in use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]    The embodiment described thus far depicts the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">sharpening stone  20</span>  has been mounted to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">covering layer  50</span> . A preferred embodiment is shown in  FIG. 6 , in which the sharpening stone is mounted to a bracket that is selectively coupled to the tool. In the bottom perspective view of  FIG. 6 , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">mounting bracket  200</span>  is attached to the bottom of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">bracket  200</span>  may be sonically welded or attached with a securing member, such as a rivet. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">bracket  200</span>  is generally L-shaped with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204">upper flange  204</span>  being located from the bottom of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span>  by a distance that is approximately equal to the thickness of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">sharpening stone  208</span>  and its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">holding bracket  210</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">sharpening stone  208</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">holding bracket  210</span>  are shown in  FIG. 7 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">sharpening stone  208</span>  has <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">two additional grooves  214</span>  that are generally parallel to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">grooves  60</span>  that are used to repair and sharpen hooks and other tackle parts. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">bracket  210</span>  includes a pair of side walls that terminate in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem218">flanges  218</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">grooves  214</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem218">sharpening stone receive flanges  218</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">bracket  210</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem220">One end  220</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">bracket  210</span>  is open to enable the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">sharpening stone  208</span>  to be inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">bracket  210</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem224">other end  224</span>  is closed to stop the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">stone  208</span> . Adhesive is applied to the edges of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">stone  208</span>  between the bottom surface and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">grooves  214</span>  to secure the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">stone  208</span>  within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">bracket  210</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem224">end  224</span>  also includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem228">tab  228</span>  that extends away from the stone. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem228">Tab  228</span>  may include an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem226">opening  226</span>  for a screw.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">sharpening stone  208</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">bracket  210</span>  are mounted to the tool by sliding the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem220">open end  220</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">bracket  210</span>  against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">bracket  200</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">Bracket  200</span>  includes <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem230">flanges  230</span>  that are separated from one another by a distance approximately the width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">sharpening stone  208</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem226">opening  226</span>  is aligned with a threaded opening in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem234">screw  234</span>  is then inserted and tightened in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem226">opening  226</span>  to secure the sharpening stone to the tool. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem234">screw  234</span>  may have a gripping adhesive, such as lock-tite, applied to the threads to help maintain the grip of the threads on the screw. The adhesive is preferably not permanent as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">stone  208</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">bracket  210</span>  may be replaced as a unit. This structure enables a user to replace a worn or broken stone or to install a stone with a different finish or groove configuration. In embodiments in which a sharpening stone is permanently mounted with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">bracket  210</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem228">tab  228</span>  may be provided without an opening for a screw and sonically welded or riveted to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">planar member  28</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    In operation, a tackle box may be provided with the utility tool or a lanyard secured to the tool may be used to secure the tool to a railing or other structure on a boat. When an angler wants to change lures or hooks, the tool may be retrieved and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lever arm  18</span>  lifted,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180"> rotated approximately 180</span> degrees, and lowered so the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem86">support  86</span>  contacts the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">planar member  24</span>  as shown in  FIG. 2 . By depressing the outboard end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lever arm  18</span>  towards the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">planar member  24</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">jaws  30</span>  and  34  are urged towards one another to snip line or a knot inserted between the jaws. After the knot is snipped, the hook or lure may be removed and placed in the tackle box. The replacing hook or lure may then be sharpened by turning the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">tool  10</span>  over to expose the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">sharpening stone  20</span> . The point may be sharpened in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">groove  60</span>  while a hook barb may be sharpened on the flat surface of the stone. The tool may then be returned to the tackle box or left to be suspended from the lanyard after the sharpened hook or lure is tied to the fishing line and the line is trimmed from the knot. Thus, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">tool  10</span>  enables hooks and lures to be more easily replaced without requiring an angler to search through a tackle box for two independent tools and possibly dropping the hook or lure.  </p>
