                        <p>  To all whom t may concern: Y l   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, WALTER H. NrcHoLLs, a citizen of the United States, residing at Charlestown, in the county of Suffolk and State of Massachusetts, havejinvented new and useful Improvements in Clippers, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention relates to improvements in cutters, clippers and the like, and while the device of my invention may be employed for a variety of purposes, it is particularly intended and adapted for use &#39;as a nail and cuticle clipper. y   </p>
                    
                        <p>   One of the objects of my invention is to provide a clipper in which the cutters may be readily removed and replaced, thisbeing of great advantage where it is desired to substitute cuticle cutters forv nail cutters and vice versa.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object is to provide means for attaching the cutters to the handle levers so that the cutters shall be carried positively in both directions by the levers Another object is to provide means to pre.- vent relative lateral displacement of the cut ting edges of the cutters.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Still other objects and advantages will appear hereinafter. i   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The invention consists in the novel features of construction vand inthe combination and arrangement of parts set forth in thev following specification and pointed out in the claims. n   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referringv to the drawing: Figure 1 is a side elevation of a c-lipper embodying my invention. Fig. 2 is a plan view of the particularly clipper shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is adetailplan section taken online 3-3 of Fig. ,2. Fig. 4 is a detail sectional view taken on line 4-4 of Fig. 3. Fig. 5 is a side eleva-V tion of t-he levers with the cutters removed, the handles of the levers being partly broken away.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Like numerals refer to like part-s throughout the several views of the drawing.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the drawing, 5 and 6 are two levers which may beof any suitable construction and which, in the present embodiment of my invention, are formed of sheet metal provided, respectively, with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> hollow<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> handles 7 and 8</span></span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> kThe l<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">evers 5 and 6</span></span> are crossed&#39; and are pivoted to each other by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> pivot 9</span> which passes therethrough. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> lever 5</span> is provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> two pa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">rallel arms 10 and 11</span></span> and, in like manner, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> lever 6</span> is provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> two pa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">rallel arms 12 and 13</span></span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> arms 10</span> and y11 are provided, respectively, with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> slots or notches 14</span> and l5 to receive a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> suitable cutter 16</span> and, in like manner, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> arms 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">2 and 13</span></span> are provided, respectively, with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> slots <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">or notches 17 and 18</span></span> `to receive a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> suitable cutter 19</span>. By reason of this construction, the cutters are carried positively in both directions by the swinging movement of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> levers<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> 5 and 6</span></span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Thev cutter 16</span> is provided with notches or slots 2O and 21 which receive the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> arms 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">0 and 11</span></span>, respectively, and, in like manner, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> cutter 19</span> is provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> notche<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">s orslots 22 and 23</span></span> which receive the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> arms 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">2 and 13</span></span>, respectively. Thus the cutters or jaws of the clipper are held against lateral displacement with relation to the levers in which they are respectively mounted.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Preferably, though not necessarily, the jaws or cutters are offset, as shown in Figs. 1 and- 3, or, in other words, their<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">g edges 24 and 25</span></span> are Qbliquely arranged, thus affordinoa a more convenient angle of the handles F and 8 when operating the clipper. In case the cutting edges are thus obliquely arranged, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> arms 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">1 and 13</span></span> will .bel eX- tended to a greater length than the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> arms 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">0 and 12</span></span>, as shown in Figs. 1 and 5a-nd in this way the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> arms 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">1 and 13</span></span> reinforce their vrespective lcutters lor jaws well out toward Fig. 4, and inclosing a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> member 26</span> constituting a guide block. To this member or guide block, the jaws are connected in any suitable manner, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> jaw 16</span> being shown pivoted at 27 to said member and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> jaw 19</span> being secured to said member by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> rivets<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> 28 and 29</span></span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   When the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> jaw 16</span> rocks to and fro with relation to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> jaw 19</span>, its inner parallel faces slide in contact with the faces of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> &#39;member or guide block 26</span> and in this way the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">g edges 24 and 25</span></span> are prevented yfrom becoming displaced laterally with relationto each other even though there may,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  be any tendency for thev arms of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> levers<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> 5 and 6</span></span> to yield laterally. &#39;Ihe function of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> member 26</span>, however, is obviously not solely that of a guide block, for it will be seen and understood that this element constitutes a mounting for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cutter<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">s or jaws 16 and 19</span></span> so that the cutters when withdrawn from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> slots <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">15 and 18</span></span> remain att-ached to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> member 26</span>. Moreover, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> member 26</span> serves as a mounting for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> rod 30</span> connecting the cutters to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> pivot 9</span>. Hence, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> member 26</span> serves as a means for forming a unitary structure of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cutter<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">s 16 and 19</span></span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> rod 30</span> by which the cutters are connected to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> pivot 9</span>. It will thus be seen that merely the removal of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> nut 32</span> permits the removal of these parts as a unit, since they are mounted upon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> member 26</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> jaws 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">6 and 19</span></span> are held inplace in any suitable manner as, for example, by providing the guide block Q6 with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> screwthreaded shank 30</span> extending through a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> hole 31</span> provided in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> pivot 9</span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> thumb-nut 32</span> having screw-threaded engagement with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> shank 30</span> draws the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> jaws toward t-lie pivot 9</span> and holds them firmly in place, yet permitting the aws to be very conveniently removed and replaced. The advantage of this is that the user may be provided with two sets of jaws identical with each other in all essential respects, one suitable for clipping the nails and one suitable for cutting the cuticle and the change from one to the other can be made very quickly and conveiiiently.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">s 7 and 8</span></span> are connected &#39;to each other by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> bow-shaped spring 33</span> suitably secured at its opposite ends to said handles, respectively, the form of this spring being such that when the handles are forced toward each other to carry the cutting edges toward each other, the spring yields toward the free ends of said handles and when the handles are released, the spring assumes the shape shown in Fig. 2. This spring, however, it will be noted, holds the handles in a certain position and prevents them from being spread apart and prevents the jaws from being spread apart unduly.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having thus described my invention, what I claim and desire by Letters Patent to secure is:   </p>

                        <p>   3. A clipper having, in combination, a pair of crossed levers provided respectively with slots, a pair of cutters provided with opposed cutting edges and located in said slots, respectively, a member on which one of said cutters is mounted, a pivot on which the other of -said cutters is pivoted to said member, said pivot being provided with an Iaperture, a pivot on which said levers are `fulcrumed, and means extending from said member through said aperture and forming an attachable and detachable connection between said member and the last-mentioned pivot.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   f1. A clipper having, in combination, a pair ot&#39; jaws, an 4element to which one of said jaws is pivoted and on which the other of said jaws is suitably mounted, a pair of :crossed levers connected respectively to said jaws to operate the same, a pivot on which said ylevers, are pivoted to each other, a screw extending from said element through said pivot, and a nut having screw-tlireaded engagement with said screw on the opposite side of said pivot to that on which said jaws are located.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  5. A clipper having, in combination, a   </p>
