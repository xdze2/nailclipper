                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> This invention is a Continuation-In-Part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 106,167, filed Oct. 8, 1987.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      TECHNICAL FIELD  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This invention relates to a nail cutting device and an associated method for treating and/or preventing ingrown nails. More specifically, the device includes a protruding blade portion for cutting a notch in the anterior extremity of a nail in order to redirect growth of the nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      BACKGROUND ART  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The condition wherein the edge of a toe or finger nail grows into the soft tissue of the digit, causing inflammation and on occasions an abscess, is generally called an ingrown nail. Ingrown nails are often caused by improper clipping of the nail. In this regard, conventional nail clippers cut the nail with a slight curvature across the anterior extremity, leaving the outer edges of the nail to grow outward, and downward, into the adjacent soft tissue. Certain conventional nail clipping devices are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 702,516; 2,774,138; 3,430,340; and 4,637,137. However, none of these devices has provided a clipping means which influences future growth of the nail so as to relieve pressure on the soft tissue and prevent future ingrowth.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a nail cutting device and associated method for treating and/or preventing ingrown nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is another object of the present invention to provide a nail cutting device for producing a notch in the anterior extremity of a nail to facilitate redirection of nail growth toward the center of the nail to prevent ingrowth of the nail into the soft tissue adjacent the nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a nail cutting device which is inexpensive to manufacture and easy to use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Other objects and advantages will be accomplished by the present invention which provides a nail cutting device and an associated method for treating and/or preventing ingrown nails. The nail cutting device comprises a first or upper member having a forward end portion defining an upper jaw provided with a protruding blade end portion, and a second or lower member having a forward end portion defining a lower jaw provided with a protruding member operatively associated with the protruding blade of the upper member. In the preferred embodiment, the protruding member defines an anvil to provide a cutting surface for the protruding blade. Actuator means are also provided for bringing the blade portion and the anvil together to effect the cutting of the nail. The method of treating and preventing ingrown nails of the present invention comprises the steps of inserting the anterior extremity of the nail between the blade portion and anvil of the cutting device and actuating the actuating means to force the blade portion through the nail so as to produce a notch in the anterior extremity of the nail. This notch serves to relieve pressure on the soft tissue adjacent the nail where ingrowth has occurred, or will likely occur, and facilitate nail growth directed toward the center of the nail.  </p>

In the preferred embodiment, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade portion 26</span> is substantially V-shaped so as to produce a V-shaped notch in the nail being cut. Further, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> forward end portion 22</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> lower member 16</span> defines a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> lower jaw 25</span> provided with a protruding member which, in the preferred embodiment, defines a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> protruding anvil 28</span> which registers with, and selectively engages, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> protruding blade portion 26</span> as the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> forwar<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">d end portions 20 and 22</span></span> are brought together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In order to selectively bring the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> forwar<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">d end portion 20 and 22</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> member<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">s 14 and 16</span></span> together to perform the cutting operation, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> device 10</span> is provided with actuator means for overcoming the outward bias of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> member<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">s 14 and 16</span></span> and forcing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade portion 26</span> in the direction of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> anvil 28</span>. In the preferred embodiment, such actuator means comprises a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> lever arm 30</span> secured to the upper and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> lower <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">members 14 and 16</span></span> with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> pivot bolt 32</span>. More specifically, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> bolt 32</span> is rotatably and slidably received through a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> hole 34</span> provide in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> member 16</span> proximate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> forward end portion 22</span>, and through a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> further hole 36</span> provided in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> member 14</span> proximate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> forward end portion 20</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> lever arm 30</span> is pivotally secured proximate its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> first end portion 38</span> to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> bolt 32</span> above the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> upper member 14</span>. Further, the lever arm is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> bend 40</span> proximate the first end portion, such that<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> lever arm 30</span> diverges from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> upper member 14</span>, and is also provided, in the preferred embodiment with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> protruding member 42</span> which selectively engages the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> upper member 14</span> and serves as a fulcrum for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> lever arm 30</span>. Accordingly, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> free end portion 44</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> lever arm 30</span> is pivoted in the direction of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> arrow 46</span> (See FIG. 2), the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> protruding member 42</span> forces the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> upper member 14</span> downwardly and forces the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> protruding blade portion 26</span> against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> anvil 28</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> lower member 16</span>. Thus, the cutting of the nail is accomplished by placing the nail between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade portion 26</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> anvil 28</span> and pivoting the lever arm to bring the blade portion and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> anvil 28</span> together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As discussed above, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> pivot bolt 32</span> is rotatably received in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> holes <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">34 and 36</span></span>. This allows the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> lever arm 30</span> to be placed in the storage position illustrated in FIG. 1. This is accomplished by rotating the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> bolt 32</span> one hundred and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180">eighty (180</span>) degrees from the position illustrated in FIG. 2 and pivoting the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> lever arm 30</span> back against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> upper member 14</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail cutting device 10</span> is designed for use in the treatment and prevention of ingrown nails. In the treatment and prevention method of the present invention, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> anvil 28</span> is inserted beneath the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> anterior extremity 48</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> nail 50</span> (See FIG. 3). It will be recognized that, unlike conventional nail clippers, in the preferred embodiment, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> device 10</span> has no lower blade, and, thus, the danger of injury to the soft tissue below the nail is avoided. Moreover, in the preferred embodiment, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> anvil 28</span> defines a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> blunted end portion 52</span> to further insure that soft tissue beneath the nail is not damaged when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> anvil 28</span> is placed in position. However, it will be understood that the protruding member of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> lower member 16</span> can define a blade portion registering with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade portion 26</span> if desired. With the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> anvil 28</span> in place, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> lever arm 30</span> is then actuated to bring the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade portion 26</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> anvil 28</span> together, cutting the nail tissue therebetween. Resultantly, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> notch 54</span> is produced in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> anterior extremity 48</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> nail 50</span> (See FIG. 4). In this regard, it has been discovered that where such a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> notch 54</span> is made in the nail, future nail growth is directed inward, toward the center of the nail, and in the direction of the notch rather than outwardly, into the soft tissue which borders the sides of the nail. Thus, where there is a pre-existing ingrown nail, the redirection of growth precipitated by the notch relieves the pressure of the nail on the damaged soft tissue, thereby relieving pain and accelerating the healing process. Further, even where there is no pre-existing ingrowth of the nail, the redirecting of future growth toward the center of the nail can prevent future ingrowth of the nail into the bordering soft tissues.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It will be noted that in the preferred embodiment, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade portion 26</span> defines a V-shaped blade member so as to produce a V-shaped notch in the nail. However, it will be understood that the configuration of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> protruding blade portion 26</span> can vary, with the intent being to provide a blade portion which produces a notch or gap in the nail to allow growth to be redirected from the area of the nail ingrowth.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      While a preferred embodiment has been shown and described, it will be understood that there is no intent to limit the invention to such disclosure, but rather it is intended to cover all modifications and alternate constructions falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. </p>
