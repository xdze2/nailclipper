                        <p>        [0002]    1. Field of Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    This invention relates to our acrylic nail design tools, specifically to the aesthetic enhancement of perfect curvature designs on top of acrylic nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    2. Description of Prior Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    Acrylic nails are used to artificially enhance the appearance of natural fingernails. Modern technology allowed development of more natural-looking nail enhancements which bond to the real nail. The term ‚Äúacrylic nail‚Äù covers a range of product types, including any method and process to alter the appearance of the natural nails. One of the acrylic nail methods and processes mentioned hereby is the process of forming a type of resin, known as acrylic powder. The acrylic nails is created by mixing monomer liquid and polymer powder together to form a thick paste, the acrylic powder that becomes moist, to sculpture and smooth over the nail bed. Once the paste or other term ‚Äúacrylic powder‚Äù is hardened and completely dried, the finished look can be filed into desired shapes and/or polished with different colors acrylic powder to create different styles or designs of acrylic nails according to the client&#39;s request.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    Nowadays, more customers are attracted to wear such beautiful natural-looking nails and styles (i.e. pink and white, glitter color, solar color, tri-color, French nails, etc); therefore, a growing number of nail technicians are challenged to perform such art work that is creative and detailed to satisfy the demand of their clients. The technician also delivers professional, skillful, and artistic service to maintain routine and establish new clientele. Therefore, the technician needs tools to assist them in creating quality and creative designs in an effective and efficient manner. The ultimate goal for the technician is creating a natural-looking and creative full set or refillable acrylic nails that last longer and are healthier.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    The method and process for the technician to cut and design the created ‚Äúmoon curve,‚Äù the curved line that is tapered to side edges to create a natural fingernail look that is divided by the nail bed and nail tip portion. The technician uses one of the common tool such as the brush to dip in the monomer liquid to carefully draw and edge the moon curve border. This method and process often requires skillful, attention to detail, and a quick hand to perform such tasks with, due to the rapid drying and hardening properties of acrylic powder. Usually, an average of 60-second timeframe (time varies depending on the climate of the surrounding atmosphere) to create the moon curve border while the acrylic powder is still moist. According to the process, the technician could experience frustration to complete the procedure, which results in an uneven moon curve that may require complete repetition of the process. Moreover, this time-consuming method and process for the technician to create the perfect the moon curve border for symmetry and consistency can cause overexposure to the customers&#39; nails bed, due to manual edging the curve with the wet brush that contained monomer liquid. Ultimately, the customer could have a full set of acrylic nails that may not last long and with increased chances of breaking and nail-fingertip separation because of overexposure processes while streamline the moon curve border. Besides, a significant disadvantage of using the brush to edge multiple arch lines or borders on the surface of the nail bed, to be filled or polished with different colors acrylic powder for different designs and styles.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    The technician can use other tools in the market to create the moon curve such as US Publication Number 20030089378 to Chu (2003) that discloses a nail apparatus with a curved edge to assist in curve nail design. U.S. Pat. No. 5,778,903 to Tran (1997) discloses an acrylic nail cutter with also a curved edge. However, the disadvantage is that the tools are not provided with various alternate size options. The tool can be too big to fit on small fingers, such as ring and pinky sizes, or too small to fit on a large finger, which affects the arch of the moon curve borders that are not proper, uneven, inconsistency, and the side edges may not tapered to side edges. In this case, an additional touch-up step is usually required by using the wet brush contained monomer liquid to enhance the moon curve properly at the upper arch and the length of the arch line tapered to all edges. Typically, the technician would spend additional time to make the moon curve perfect and symmetrical in respect to each finger in a full set. Also, the customers are at risk to overexpose-to nail beds due to the touch-up step to enhance a perfect natural-looking of the moon curve.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    Some technicians attempt to use artificial tips to match up the fingers size to cut the acrylic powder for the moon curve border; however, due to the characteristic of the product, it does not cut well when the acrylic powder hardens. Perhaps, the curve border is crushed as the acrylic powder hardens and the depth of the upper arch is low. In addition, the product is not made to be reused to different customers and/or to soak in acetone or sanitizing liquid to remove debris after each use for hygiene. For example, the substance monomer liquid and polymer powder reacts and changes to dry paste quickly. It would need tools with the strength and density to support a clear cut when the paste hardens. Also, after use, the debris could remain hardened and clogged on the tool; therefore, acetone would be needed to easily remove the debris without damaging the original quality and the natural characteristics of the tool for impressing the moon curve border, arch lines, or borders. In such process, the technician is confronted with issues such as spending additional time to touch up by edging, enhancing, and perfecting the moon curve border. Additionally, the technician needs to dispose the product after use on each customer due to the properties of the materials. Finally, the customer is at risk to overexposure to nail bed with the wet brush during the touch-up process, and extra materials will be used.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0010]    In view of the limitations now present in the process, the present invention provides a new and useful tool set to use in cosmetic area to cut acrylic powder, to create or design not just the moon curve, but also impress various arch lines, to establish borders to set different colors and styles of full-set or refill of acrylic nails. Wherein the invention tool set is operated and used after the method and process of applying acrylic powder, a mixture of monomer liquid and polymer powder that forms into a creamy paste texture to sculpture the nail bed for artificial nail enhancement.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    The invention is configured with proper arches that best match to most finger sizes for natural-looking of moon curve border when cut off the acrylic powder. The alternate sizing of the invention is in a set, ranging from small, medium, and large in respect to the fingers (thumb, middle, index, ring, and pinky). The depth of the curve and the width of the arch are the best combination configured with consistency and symmetry to have the impression in designing various moon curves, arch lines, or borders. In addition, the invention is useful in the method of scraping off the acrylic powder at any edge or in between borders on the nail bed. The invention is useful in scooping off the acrylic powder that form lump, bump, or air bubbles while the technician sculpting the nail bed. The invention is further capability in the method of breaking the air bubbles that is trapped in the nail bed for healthier and quality nails. The invention is constructed with quality, strength, and density to work on the acrylic powder that is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> hardens approximately during 10</span> seconds before it completely dries. The invention is universally usable and versatile in operation than known apparatus of this kind.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    The invention has several significant advantages that will benefit the technician in many ways, including the ability to perform the artwork in a creative, effortless, and less time-consuming process; thereby, minimizing the labor, touch-up, and repetition processes after the process and method of applying the acrylic powder on the nail bed. By having these flexibilities, it would remove the burden, frustration, and pressure for the technician to perform the creative artwork on the acrylic nails. Meanwhile, the use of the invention will reduce the risk of overexposure to the customer&#39;s nail bed with liquid due to the cuts of moon curve, arch line, or border on the acrylic nails that are natural-looking and perfectly tapered to side edges. More importantly, it helps to generate a durable seal at the streamline of the moon curve border for healthy nails. Therefore, the present invention will benefits to both technicians and the customers to reduce with suffer in difficulty designing various arch lines and issues such as overexposure, redo, touch-up, time, and materials due to the lack of the use of tool and process. In another aspect, the invention wills benefits to the technicians and customers to enhance the cosmetic look and perform a quality, long lasting, healthy acrylic fingernails and/or toenails.  </p>
