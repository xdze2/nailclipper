                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> The present invention relates to a nail clipper which comprises a slender body formed by an upper press lever and a lower press lever which are movably engaged, an upper cover and a lower cover which are respectively fitted onto the outer surfaces of the upper press lever and the lower press lever to form a slender etui, a lower blade which is movably pivotally engaged with one end of the upper press lever by means of a first pivotal axle, and an upper blade which is movably pivotally engaged with one end of the lower press lever by means of a second pivotal axle. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    The present invention relates to a nail clipper and more particularly pertains to a nail clipper capable of being folded into a portable body in the shape of an etui, and belongs in the field of manicuring and pedicuring implements.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0002]    Most nail clippers available on the market have open cutting edges when they are stored, thereby not only easily cutting clothing articles or handbags, but also possibly scratching users&#39; bodies. It is therefore very dangerous. Besides, cutting edges will also turn blunt through constant grinding against outside objects. Dirt is also easily accumulated in the gaps between the cutting edges. The lifetime of such a nail clipper is thus shortened. As the cutting edges of the nail clipper are open, its thickness is increased, and an irregular shape is exhibited. It is inconvenient to be stored, and it is also difficult to combine it with other tools to form a multipurpose tool. The scope of applications is therefore restricted.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    For the sake of safety, some nail clippers have a casing each and the user places the nail clipper inside the casing for storage after use. Although this can prevent the cutting edges of the nail clipper from cutting the clothing articles or the bodies when it is stored and can protect the cutting edges, the casing is easily lost and the user needs to open the casing to take out the nail clipper before use and then to adjust the press lever of the nail clipper for use and it is therefore inconvenient.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    Nail clippers capable of being folded into thin pieces after use are also available on the market. The cutting edges of such a nail clipper come into abutting contact when the nail clipper is stored, and it is safe and reliable, and the cutting edges are also protected. While the cutting edges come into abutting contact, nevertheless the left and right ends thereof are generally projecting corners and do not form a smooth surface, and so there are still the risks of scratching users&#39; bodies. Further, gaps also exist between the cutting edges and they easily hold dirt, thereby affecting hygiene.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    To conceal the cutting edges completely, some nail clippers have a sleeve each and the fastener corresponds to the body of the nail clipper in size. The sleeve is connected to the nail clipper pivotally. While in use the sleeve is pulled out along the axis to the end of the nail clipper and then the press lever is pulled up and turned over for use. After use, the press lever is turned over reversely to be laid horizontally on the main body of the nail clipper, and then the sleeve is pushed back along the axis to the main body of the nail clipper to store the nail clipper. Although this proposal can resolve the problem of having the cutting edges exposed when the nail clipper is stored, the sleeve has to be produced with additional materials, thereby increasing the production costs.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    There are nail clippers on the market each of which is capable of being folded into an etui after use for storage by means of a protruding fastener and a receiving fastener. However, as the protruding fastener abrades against the receiving fastener over a long period of time, the protruding fastener is easily worn out and broken and the nail clipper fails to attain the effects of being convenient and durable.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0007]    In view of the aforesaid disadvantages, the object of the present invention is to provide a nail clipper which has the advantages of being safe and reliable, small in size, convenient for storage, and capable of reducing the production costs.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    To attain this, the present invention adopts the following technical proposals:  </p>

                        <p>          [0019]    The ends not adjacent to the third pivotal axle of the upper cover or the lower cover of the said nail clipper is disposed with a ring onto which a key ring or a hanging ornament can be attached to facilitate its ease of carrying or to increase its aesthetic value.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]    The operating principles of the present invention are as follows:  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]    When the present invention is stored, the upper press lever and the lower press lever are folded, the protruding members are inserted into the receiving members. As the widths of the receiving members are slightly shorter than the widths of the two protruding pieces, the two protruding pieces shift slightly inwards when being compressed, thereby attaining the interlocking effect, and therefore the lower blade and the upper blade come into abutting contact and are locked, and the cutting edges of the lower blade and the upper blade occlude, and the lower blade and the upper blade are entirely just fit for storage within the slender body. Since the upper cover and the lower cover are fitted onto the upper press lever and the lower press lever, when the upper press lever and the lower press lever are folded, the upper cover and the lower cover form a slender etui. It is convenient for storage and it can also completely protect the cutting edges, thereby preventing them from being exposed and holding dirt.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]    When the present invention is in use, the upper cover and the lower cover are first gently pulled open, as the upper cover and the lower cover are fitted onto the upper press lever and the lower press lever, the upper press lever and the lower press lever are therefore simultaneously pulled open, thereby causing the protruding members to be disengaged from the receiving members. The upper cover and the lower cover are then rotated along the pivotal axles relative to the lower blade and the upper blade until they are substantially horizontally disposed, the lower blade and the upper blade are then open, and the user is only required to compress the parts near the ends of the upper cover and the lower cover, it can bring the sharp cutting edges of the lower blade and the upper blade to occlude. By repeatedly compressing the parts near the ends of the upper cover and the lower cover, the cutting edges of the lower blade and the upper blade are movably open and close, thereby achieving the object of nail trimming.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]    After use, the upper cover and the lower cover are then folded, and the parts on the surfaces of the upper cover and the lower cover which are in position corresponding to the protruding members and the receiving members are pressed inwards by fingers, thereby inserting the protruding members into the receiving members along the wider opening portion, so as to lock the lower blade and the upper blade when they come into abutting contact and to store them within the slender body, and the nail clipper is folded into an etui.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    By adopting the said technical proposals, the present invention provides a nail clipper which has the advantages of being safe and reliable, small in size, convenient for storage, and capable of reducing the production costs. The upper and lower press levers of the present invention can completely conceal the cutting edges, prevent the cutting edges from being exposed causing scratches on clothing articles and human bodies, and prevent dirt and the like from accumulating in between the cutting edges, thereby making the nail clipper more durable. As the etui for storing the cutting edges is simultaneously used as the press levers, the construction of the present invention can be simplified and fewer production materials are used, thereby reducing the production costs.  </p>

                        <p>          [0035]    As illustrated in  FIGS. 5 and 6 , when the present invention is stored, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">upper press lever  1</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lower press lever  2</span>  are folded, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">protruding members  13</span>  are inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">receiving members  23</span> . As the widths of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">receiving members  23</span>  are slightly shorter than the widths of the two protruding pieces, the two protruding pieces shift slightly inwards when being compressed, thereby attaining the interlocking effect, and therefore the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">lower blade  4</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">upper blade  3</span>  come into abutting contact and are locked, and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">cutting edges  41</span> ,  31  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">lower blade  4</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">upper blade occlude  3</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">lower blade  4</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">upper blade  3</span>  are entirely just fit for storage within the slender body. Since the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper cover  11</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower cover  21</span>  are fitted onto the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">upper press lever  1</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lower press lever  2</span> , when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">upper press lever  1</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lower press lever  2</span>  are folded, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper cover  11</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower cover  21</span>  form a slender etui. It is convenient for storage and it can also completely protect the cutting edges, thereby preventing them from being exposed and holding dirt.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0036]    As illustrated in  FIGS. 2 and 3 , when the present invention is in use, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper cover  11</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower cover  21</span>  are first gently pulled open, as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper cover  11</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower cover  21</span>  are fitted onto the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">upper press lever  1</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lower press lever  2</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">upper press lever  1</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lower press lever  2</span>  are therefore simultaneously pulled open, thereby causing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">protruding members  13</span>  to be disengaged from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">receiving members  23</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper cover  11</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower cover  21</span>  are then rotated along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">pivotal axles  5</span> ,  6  relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">lower blade  4</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">upper blade  3</span>  until they are substantially horizontally disposed, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">lower blade  4</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">upper blade  3</span>  are then open, and the user is only required to compress the parts near the ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper cover  11</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower cover  21</span> , it can bring the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">sharp cutting edges  41</span> ,  31  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">lower blade  4</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">upper blade  3</span>  to occlude. By repeatedly compressing the parts near the ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper cover  11</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower cover  21</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">cutting edges  41</span> ,  31  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">lower blade  4</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">upper blade  3</span>  are movably open and close, thereby achieving the object of nail trimming.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0037]    As illustrated in  FIGS. 3 and 4 , after use, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper cover  11</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower cover  21</span>  are then folded, and the parts on the surfaces of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper cover  11</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower cover  21</span>  which are in position corresponding to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">protruding members  13</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">receiving members  23</span>  are pressed inwards by fingers, thereby inserting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">protruding members  13</span>  into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">receiving members  23</span>  along the wider opening portion, so as to lock the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">lower blade  4</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">upper blade  3</span>  when they come into abutting contact and to store them within the slender body, and the nail clipper is folded into an etui.  </p>
