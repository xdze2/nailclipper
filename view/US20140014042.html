                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> Apparatuses disclosed herein aid in shearing animal claws. Specifically, the present invention provides a shearing apparatus having at least one curved blade, but preferably two curved blades, allowing cutting of the animal&amp;#39;s claw from opposite sides of the animal&amp;#39;s claw, and at least one well for placing the animal&amp;#39;s claw therein, wherein said two curved blades are disposed at an aperture located at the bottom of the well. The well and aperture combination stops the animal&amp;#39;s claw from being sheared too close to nerve endings and the animal&amp;#39;s blood supply, preventing or minimizing the incidence of injury and suffering to the animal. Methods of using the apparatus are further disclosed herein. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> TECHNICAL FIELD  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    The present invention relates to apparatuses for shearing animal claws. Specifically, the present invention provides shearing apparatuses having at least one curved blade. Preferably, the present invention provides a shearing apparatus having two curved blades, allowing cutting of the animal claw from opposite sides of the animal&#39;s claw, and at least one well for placing the animal&#39;s claw therein, wherein said two curved blades form apertures within wells. The well and aperture combination stops the animal&#39;s claw from being sheared too close to nerve endings and the animal&#39;s blood supply, preventing or minimizing the incidence of injury and suffering to the animal. Methods of using the apparatus are further disclosed herein.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    It is, of course, generally known to cut, trim or otherwise shear animal claws. Generally, animal claws, such as animals that are pets, farm animals, performance animals, or the like, can have relatively sharp claws that are typically used for defense or predatory behavior. In most cases, claws are naturally sharp, or the animals instinctively sharpen the same through their behavior. A cat, for example, instinctively maintains the sharpness of their claws by scratching items, such as trees or the like. This is due to the fact that cats&#39; claws lose an outside layer of their claws periodically, exposing newer and sharper claws therebeneath. Scratching their claws helps to remove this sheath when necessary.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    In many cases, it is desirable to reduce the sharpness of animals&#39; claws, especially if the animal is a pet that may live in close proximity to people, or if the animal comes into close proximity to other animals. Specifically, it is known to utilize shearing devices for cutting the animals&#39; claws when desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,449,297 relates to an animal claw cutting apparatus having a pair of cutters having cooperating shearing edges. A first cutter has a concave cylindrically shaped surface, the bottom edge of which is generally circular. The second cutter has a U-shaped member with the base portion provided at the center with an upwardly extending post having a flat upper surface.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    However, heretofore known devices and apparatuses for cutting animal claws suffer from disadvantages. Specifically, many known claw cutters utilize a blade that pinches the animals&#39; claws to shear the same, creating forces that may deform, bend or even shatter the animal&#39;s claws in undesired areas. Thus, a need exists for an apparatus and methods of using the same that quickly and evenly shears the animals&#39; claws without pinching the same, minimizing deformations, bending or even shattering of the claws during cutting.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    For example, many known claw cutters utilize a so-called “guillotine”-type cutting device, having a linear blade that cuts straight through the animals&#39; claws, imparting uneven forces on the animals&#39; claws as the blades cuts. A need exists for an apparatus and methods of using the same that includes one or more curved blades that evenly distribute cutting forces on the animals&#39; claws, since the animals&#39; claws are roughly round in cross-section.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    Moreover, heretofore known devices and apparatuses for cutting animals&#39; claws require extensive force to cut through the animals&#39; claws, and individuals may not have sufficient strength to fully cut the same, as necessary. Thus, a need exists for an apparatus and methods of using the same that requires minimal cutting force to accomplish the cutting task through the animals&#39; claws.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    In addition, many known devices or apparatuses utilize a relatively large aperture or cutting surface for fitting the animals&#39; claws therein for cutting the same, requiring the user of the devices or apparatuses to gauge the best or optimal cutting location on the animals&#39; claws. However, if an animal&#39;s claw is cut too close to the base of the claw, then the claw may be cut too close to nerves and blood supply, causing injury and pain or discomfort for the animal, and possibly bleeding. A need, therefore, exists for an apparatus and methods of using the same that prevents cutting the animals&#39; claws too closely to nerves and/or blood supply, preventing injury and pain or discomfort to the animal.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    Further, it is difficult to prevent an animal from moving when attempting to cut the animal&#39;s claws, unless the animal is completely anesthetized prior to the same. It is rare to anesthetize an animal during a claw-cutting procedure, so animals tend to move, squirm or the like during the process. Thus, it may be difficult to ensure that the animal&#39;s claws are not cut too closely to the nerve endings and/or blood supply, as detailed above, especially if the animal moves, or squirms during the cutting process. A need, therefore, exists for an apparatus and methods of using the same for ensuring that animals&#39; claws are not cut too close to nerves or blood supply, especially if the animals move or squirm during the cutting procedure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    Many known devices require a keen eye to ensure that the claws are cut at the proper location so as not to cut too closely to nerves and/or blood supply. In many instances, individuals with poor eyesight or limited dexterity may find it difficult to hold a claw and a cutting tool to cut the claw at the proper location or to even see where the proper cutting location may be. A need, therefore, exists for an apparatus and methods of using the same that allows individuals with poor eyesight and/or limited dexterity to utilize the apparatus to cut animals&#39; claws in the proper cutting location.  </p>

The point at which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">arms  16</span> ,  18  may be limited may allow holes in both the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">arms  16</span> ,  18  to align allowing an animal&#39;s claw to be disposed therein.  FIG. 4 , a sectional view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">apparatus  10</span>  viewed along line IV-IV of  FIG. 3  illustrates a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second conical well  34</span>  disposed in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">arm  18</span>  matching the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">conical well  24</span>  disposed in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">arm  16</span> , but inverted. Thus, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second well  34</span>  may form an inverted conical shape relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">conical well  24</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second well  34</span>  may have <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sloping walls  36</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">circular cutting blade  38</span>  disposed within the well, forming a perimeter of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">claw-receiving hole or aperture  40</span> . When aligned, as shown in  FIGS. 1-4 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cutting blades  28</span>  and  38  may be disposed adjacent one another, and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">respective claw-receiving holes  30</span> ,  40  may align to allow passage of an animal&#39;s claw therethrough.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0055]      FIG. 5  illustrates the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">apparatus  10</span>  having <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">wells  24</span> ,  34  unaligned due to pivoting movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">arms  16</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> 18  via pivot  20</span> . Preferably, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">arms  16</span> ,  18  may be moved by squeezing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">hand grips  12</span> ,  14  together so that they come together and meet, like using scissors. The movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">arms  16</span> ,  18  may displace the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">wells  24</span> ,  34  from each other, thereby misaligning the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">holes  30</span> ,  40  from each other.  FIG. 6  illustrates a cross-sectional view viewed along lines VI-VI of  FIG. 5  illustrates how the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">holes  30</span> ,  40  become misaligned when <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">arms  16</span> ,  18  move relative to each other. An animal claw disposed through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">holes  30</span> ,  40  may preferably be sheared by both the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">circular cutting blades  28</span> ,  38 , respectively, when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">arms  16</span> ,  18  are moved and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">holes  30</span> ,  40  become misaligned.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0056]    Specifically, as illustrated in  FIG. 7 , an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">animal cla<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">w  50</span>  may be placed within well  24</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">apparatus  10</span>  through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">holes  30</span> ,  40  (not shown) when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">holes  30</span> ,  40  are aligned. The conical shape and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">sloping walls  26</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">well  24</span>  may aid a user in placing the animal&#39;s claws through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">holes  30</span> ,  40 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">Squeezing hand grips  12</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> 14  together misaligns holes  30</span> ,  40  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">engages cutting blades  28</span> ,  38  to the animal claw, thereby cutting the claw from both sides of the claw, as illustrated in  FIG. 8 . Shearing of the claw is easy and efficient because the shapes of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">circular cutting blades  28</span> ,  38  generally match the animal&#39;s claw, in cross-section, allowing more blade surface to engage the claw when shearing the same. Moreover, by cutting from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">both sides via blades  28</span> ,  38 , the animal claw may be cut more expeditiously and cleanly. Finally, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">holes  30</span> ,  40  may be appropriately sized to only receive the animal&#39;s claws up to a certain length therethrough, providing an easy way for a user to determine the proper cutting location on the animal&#39;s claw. This may minimize cutting an animal&#39;s claw too short, thereby minimizing discomfort, pain, and/or bleeding of the same.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0057]    Specifically,  FIGS. 11A-11C  illustrates a method of using the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">apparatus  10</span>  in an embodiment of the present invention. An <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">animal&#39;s claw  50</span> , such as a cat&#39;s claw, for example, having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">tip  51</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">core  53</span>  having nerves and/or blood vessels, may be placed within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">well  24</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">apparatus  10</span> , as illustrated in  FIG. 11A . The relatively wider opening at the top of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">sloping walls  26</span>  may allow a user to more easily place the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">tip  51</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">claw  50</span>  through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">holes  30</span> ,  40  for shearing of the same. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">claw  50</span>  may interact with the relatively large opening of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">well  24</span>  and traverse the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">well wall  26</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">holes  30</span> ,  40 , which are aligned to allow passage of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">tip  51</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">claw  50</span> , as illustrated in  FIG. 11B . Preferably, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">holes  30</span> ,  40  may be sized to allow only the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">tip  51</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">claw  50</span>  through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">holes  30</span> ,  40  so that the shearing of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">tip  51</span>  from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">claw  50</span>  does not hit the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">core  53</span>  and any nerves or blood vessels contained therein, as illustrated in  FIG. 11C .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0058]    Specifically,  FIG. 11C  illustrates the movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">well  24</span>  relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">well  34</span> , illustrated in cross-sections, allowing the blades, as described herein, to shear the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">tip  51</span>  from the remainder of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">claw  50</span> . Thus, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">well  24</span>  may guide the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">tip  51</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">claw  50</span>  through the holes, making it easier for a user to shear the animal&#39;s claw, especially if the animal is being uncooperative, or if the user has manual dexterity issues.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0059]    In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">apparatus  100</span>  is illustrated in  FIG. 9 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">apparatus  100</span>  may be similar to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">apparatus  10</span> , illustrated and described above with reference to  FIGS. 1-8 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">although arms  116</span> ,  118  may extend to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">form handles  112</span> ,  114  that may be squeezed together as one would hold and utilize a pair of pliers instead of a pair of scissors.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0060]    Attached to ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">arms  116</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120"> 118  may be plates  120</span> ,  122  having <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124">wells  124</span> ,  134  disposed therein having cutting blades and holes, the wells being formed similarly to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">wells  24</span> ,  34 , described above. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">Squeezing together handles  112</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120"> 114  may move plate  120</span>  relative to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">plate  122</span>  to misalign the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124">wells  124</span> ,  134  allowing the cutting blades to shear the animal&#39;s claw, as described above. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem123">spring  123</span>  may allow the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">apparatus  100</span>  to move back to its starting position, namely moving the handles back to the starting position, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124">realigning wells  124</span> ,  134  to allow an animal claw to be placed therethrough.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0061]    Although a preferred embodiment includes a pair of wells, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">whether wells  24</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124"> 34  or wells  124</span> ,  134 , as described above, the present invention contemplates alternate arrangements, including only a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem224">single conical well  224</span>  having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem228">circular cutting blade  228</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem230">hole  230</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem234">second perpendicular well  234</span>  with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem240">hole  240</span> , as illustrated in the cross-sectional view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">apparatus  200</span>  shown in  FIG. 10 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem234">second well  234</span>  may not have a cutting blade. Thus, when the respective wells are misaligned through movement of the arms of the apparatus, only the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem228">cutting blade  228</span>  may shear the animal claw when placed therein.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0062]    Alternatively, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem234">well  234</span>  may have a plate or cover (not shown) disposed on an end thereof that acts as a block for an animal claw, thereby blocking the animal claw from being disposed too far through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem230">hole  230</span> , thereby preventing the shearing of the animal claw too far up the claw, preventing or minimizing discomfort, pain, and bleeding of the animal claw.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0063]    It should be noted that various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention and without diminishing its attendant advantages. </p>
