                        <p>      Priority is claimed from provisional patent application U.S. Ser. No. 61/688,473 filed on May 15, 2012, and incorporated by reference herein.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>

                        <p>      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In general, the present invention relates to an adaptive device for a clipper generally utilized on finger and toenails. More in particular, the present invention generally provides a removable device for use with a standard clipper that allows for selective positioning on the hand utilizing the clippers and provides a mechanical advantage as well as an easier and more accurate utilization of same.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Description of the Prior Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Humans and many animals possess a flattened, elastic structure of a horny texture located on the dorsal surface of the terminal phalanges of the fingers and toes, commonly referred to as ‚Äúnails‚Äù. Due to the nature of nails, they are constantly growing and, therefore, the subject of constant personal grooming and trimming to be kept at a reasonable length.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Most common nail clippers comprise upper and lower mandibles, which are connected together at one end. The opposite end typically has opposed facing jaws having sharpened cutting edges. The mandibles are generally manufactured from spring steel or the like and are slightly divergent from each other from their point of connection, at one end, to the cutting edges at the other. The mandibles are apertured near the cutting edges to accept a rotatable hinge post, which is disposed generally at right angles to the cutting edges.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      An operating lever is secured to the hinge post and has an upstanding cam surface formed thereon, adjacent to the hinge post. The operating lever may be elevated and rotated from a position nested adjacent the upper mandible to an inverted position in vertical alignment above the upper mandible with the cam surface rotated so as to be brought in engagement with exposed face of the upper mandible. Through pressure on the operating lever, the cam surface on the operating lever forces the upper mandible into contact with the lower mandible to thereby clip a nail positioned there between.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Nail clippers are most frequently held between the thumb and the phalange of the second row of the index finger and squeezed together to trim the anterior extremity or free edge of the nail. While they are held at a right angle to the phalange of the second row of the index finger, the divergent ends are squeezed together to bring the cutting blades against the nail from above and below.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      While most adults can operate clippers in this manner, using the phalange of the second row of the index finger brings about a certain amount of instability in that neither the thumb nor the index finger holds the clippers in a fixed direction so that it tends to flop about. Some stability is achieved by temporarily pressing the jaws of the clippers against the end of the finger, adjacent the nail to be trimmed, to provide more stable, three-point positioning.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A shortcoming of this design is the difficulty of securely gripping the nail clipper so as to firmly and accurately position the clipper adjacent a nail so as to position and maintain the nail between the jaws without shearing while applying sufficient pressure on the operating lever to close the jaws to cut the nail. Where there is a sufficient size difference between the clipper and the operator&#39;s hand, or where the hand of the operator suffers an injury or illness which limits the force or accuracy which the force may be applied to the operating lever, or where the operator&#39;s hands are slippery from water, soap or toiletry products, operation of the clipper may be difficult.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is known in the prior art to provide a loop to the clipper for positioning the clipper on a finger. These prior art devices are typically formed into the body of the clipper and are made from metal like the body of the clipper. These devices, however, do not allow for removal, are more expensive, and do not provide a relatively flexible fit for positioning on a finger. Furthermore, due to the nature of a metal loop, the fit on the finger is not adjustable which may mean the loop is too small or too large making the loop unusable depending on the person&#39;s finger size. These loops are made into the body of the clipper are not removable meaning that if the loop does not fit the user, the clipper becomes unusable by the user.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      There is currently a need for an adaptive device that is easily usable as well as affordable. Currently in the prior art, there is no such device which is sufficient. The above discussion is not to be considered exhaustive, however, does demonstrate that a need exists for allowing individuals to effectively customize a clipper as desired. The consuming public is looking for solutions to address these needs and there is an obvious need to fill the gap where the prior art has failed. What is needed is an adaptive device to address these shortcomings in the prior art.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of devices for use with clipper and standard clippers in general now present in the prior art, the current invention provides a new and improved design where the prior art fails. As such, the general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new and improved removable adaptive device for use with nail clippers which has all the advantages of the prior art and none of the disadvantages.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention essentially provides a removable and relatively flexible finger piece that attaches to the rear end of the nail clippers to position the third row or distal phalange of the index finger therein to eliminate the conventional right angle arrangement between the axis of the thumb and index finger. Using this invention, the clippers may then be held between the ends of the thumb and index finger while they are in a substantial parallel, pincer-like position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In one embodiment, the distal phalange of the index finger is fixedly captured in the finger piece to make the whole assembly pivotally inflexible. This provides the greatest accuracy for nail clipping. In another embodiment, the finger piece allows for an angled holding of the clipper relative to the index finger during use. This provides improved retaining of the clippers during use during a generally right angle of use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The invention allows for the nail clippers to generally be converted from a tool held between the thumb and phalange of the second row of the index finger to one captured between the thumb and distal phalange of the index finger in a pincer-like manner to provide greatly improved stability and accuracy and to eliminate the need to balance the clippers against the end of the finger whose nail is to be clipped.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are, of course, additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.  </p>

                        <p>      Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved removable adaptive device for clippers that may allow greater stability during use and improved stability during use by persons having a lesser degree of dexterity with their fingers and thumbs.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is a further object of the present invention to provide a new and improved removable adaptive device for clippers that may also be customizable in regards to orientation of the clipper on the hand as desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      An even further object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved removable adaptive device for clippers that is susceptible to a low cost of manufacture and implementation, and, thus accordingly, is then susceptible to low prices of sale or use to the consuming public thereby making such economically available.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Still another object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved removable adaptive device for clippers which provides all of the advantages of the prior art, while simultaneously overcoming some of the disadvantages normally associated therewith.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Another object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved removable adaptive device for clippers that may provide for the nail clippers to be converted from a tool held between the thumb and phalange of the second row of the index finger to one captured between the thumb and distal phalange of the index finger in a pincer-like manner to provide greatly improved stability and accuracy and to eliminate the need to balance the clippers against the end of the finger whose nail is to be clipped.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved removable adaptive device for clippers that lessen the risk of accidental injury while grooming.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a new and improved removable adaptive device for clippers that provides a tapered opening for a finger thus allowing the individual user to utilize the loop regardless of size or otherwise making the loop a universal fit.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      These, together with other objects of the invention, along with the various features of novelty that characterize the invention, are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure.

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to the illustrations, pictures and drawings, where like elements are generally identified with like numerals throughout, in a preferred embodiment, invention  10  generally comprises removable adaptive device for clippers, system and method of making and using the same. Invention  10  generally includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">ring  20</span>  with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">slit  3<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">0</span>  for positioning clippers  40</span>  and an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">aperture  50</span>  for positioning a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">finger  60</span> . Invention  10  may be of many dimensions, shapes and sizes and the illustration should not be considered to limit the invention to just the illustrations. It is understood that although the illustrations and detailed description refer to the invention generally as a ‚Äúremovable adaptive device for clippers‚Äù, the current invention should not be limited by the term and terms.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is contemplated that the current invention may have numerous applications and utilities where it is desired to generally provide an adaptive device to a standard or known nail clipper. The invention is not limited to clippers and may be utilized on other types of instruments such as but not limited to other grooming devices, medical instruments, industrial tools and so forth. Furthermore, the term ‚Äúring‚Äù should not be considered to limit the invention to conventional ornamental rings or items worn like ornamental rings.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In a preferred embodiment, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">ring  20</span>  is an elastomeric and may be made from a polymer, elastomer, artificial elastomer, natural or manmade rubber, and combinations thereof having a durometer of about and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> around 40</span>. A preferred embodiment utilizes a durometer hardness of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> about 40</span> although more and less may also be contemplated. It is understood that a durometer is one of several measures of the hardness of a material. Hardness may be defined as a material&#39;s resistance to permanent indentation. The term durometer is often used to refer to the measurement, as well as the instrument itself. Durometer is typically used as a measure of hardness in polymers, elastomers, and rubbers. There are several scales of durometer, used for materials with different properties. The two most common scales, using slightly different measurement systems, are the ASTM D2240 type A and type D scales. The A scale is for softer plastics, while the D scale is for harder ones. However, the ASTM D2240-00 testing standard calls for a total of 12 scales, depending on the intended use; types A, B, C, D, DO, E, M, O, OO, OOO, OOO-S, and R. Each scale results in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> value between 0 and 100</span>, with higher values indicating a harder material.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is contemplated the material is soft enough to allow a firm wedging of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">clipper<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">s  40</span>  into slit  30</span> , but not so elastic that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">ring  20</span>  deforms while in operation. Too much deformation makes the invention non-sturdy and may cause unwanted slippage. It is not desirable for the material to deform to such a degree that the force used to operate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">clippers  40</span>  causes unwanted movement while in operation. It has been found that a durometer of 60 to 70 provides a preferred embodiment to avoid such.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to the illustrations, a known general type of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail clippers  40</span>  to which this invention may be applied is depicted. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">Nail clippers  40</span>  are shown to comprise an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">upper member  70</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">lower member  80</span>  coextensive in length with each other, in cooperatively opposed and superimposed position, having co<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90">rrespondingly mated inward end portions  90</span>  <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">and spaced-apart outward end portions  100</sp<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">an>  wherein said outward end portions  100</span>  are fixedly joined together at <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">end or member junction  110</span>  by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">rivet  120</span>  or other known means. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">Members  70</span>  and  80  are yieldingly resilient and made from spring-type material such as chrome-plated or nickel silver plated stainless steel and the like. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90"> </p>
                    
                        <p>      Inward end portions  90</span>  are spring-biased, by the original bend applied to either or both members, and spaced-apart in divergent relationship. They include <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130">transverse confronting jaws  130</span>  with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">mating primary cutting blades  140</span>  of requisite curvature and clipping ability.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">lever  150</span>  is pivotally retained in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem160">notch  160</span>  formed in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem170">stud  170</span>  that is loosely retained in a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180">aligned apertures  180</span>  and  190 , formed in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">members  70</span>  and  80  respectively, at a divergent portion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">members  70</span>  and  80 , and extends angularly upward from a divergent portion of said members to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">thumb rest  200</span>  located at the distal end thereof. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">cam-like surface  210</span>  is formed on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">lever  150</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">bears against upper member  70</span>  for rotating with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">lever  150</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">squeezing said members  70</span>  and  80  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">cutting blades  140</span>  together in a clipping action when <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">said lever  150</span>  is angularly pivoted downward, by thumb pressure, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">toward member junction  110</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> </p>
                    
                        <p>      Ring  20</span>  may be removably attached to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">said fixed end junction  110</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">members  70</span>  and  80  for housing the distal end or third row phalange of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">index finger  60</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">Ring  20</span>  is preferably attached to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">said end junction  110</span>  on the opposite side thereof from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">lever  150</span>  to allow for the maximum angular movement there between.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In a preferred construction, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">ring  20</span>  is a capsular body having an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">apertur<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">e  50</span>  for placing finger  60</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">Slit  30</span>  is generally configured to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">receive fixed end junction  110</span>  by wedging in th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">e semi elastic material comprising ring  20</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">Aperture  50</span>  may be of numerous sizes and shapes and may also be generally tapered. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">Slit  30</span>  may also be of numerous sizes and shapes and may also be generally tapered. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> </p>
                    
                        <p>      Slit  3<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">0</span>  may also receive thumb rest  200</span>  as generally depicted in  FIG. 2 . It is also understood that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">ring  20</span>  may have <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">more<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> than one slit  30</span>  wherein slit  30</span>  may be oriented to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">allow clippers  40</span>  to generally be at right angle to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">finger  60</span>  as generally depicted in  FIG. 4 . Numerous angles are <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">contemplated for slit  30</span>  as well as number of same. A preferred embodiment may include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem220">second slit  220</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In a preferred embodiment, the axis x-x of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">ring  20</span>  is essentially parallel to the plane formed by the central axis of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">members  70</span>  and  80  so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">forefinger or finger  60</span>  and thumb are generally in a pincer-like position when <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">holding clippers  40</span>  in operable position. By this means, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">clippers  40</span>  may be pointed to a finger or toenail and used in clipping fashion while fully controlled by said finger and thumb, thereby eliminating the need to balance the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">clippers  40</span>  against the finger or toe whose nail is to be clipped.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is therefore contemplated to provide a removable ring accessory for a nail clipper comprising a first aperture adapted for removably securing to a human finger; a second aperture adapted for removably securing to said nail clipper; and wherein said ring accessory is made from an elastomeric material and said elastomeric material has a durometer of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> about 40</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is also therefore contemplated to provide a nail clipper system comprising a pair of upper and lower co-extensive, yieldingly-resilient and cooperatively-opposed members having correspondingly-mated inward and outward end portions; said outward end portions of said members superimposed upon each other and fixedly joined together; said inward ends spring biased and spaced-apart in divergent relationship and including transverse confronting jaws with mating primary cutting blades of requisite curvature and clipping ability; a lever extending angularly upward from a pivotal mounting at a divergent portion of said members and including a cam-like surface for angular movement with said lever thereabout to squeeze said blades together in a clipping action when said lever is rotated toward said joined ends of said members; and an elastomeric ring having a first aperture adapted to be removably attached to said members at said joined ends and a second aperture adapted to removably hold the distal phalange of the user&#39;s index finger in fixed receipt therein to operatively support said clipper between the thumb and the end of the forefinger in a pincer-like position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A number of implementations have been described herein. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made. Accordingly, other implementations are within the scope of the following claims. Changes may be made in the combinations, operations, and arrangements of the various parts, elements, and amounts described herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. From the foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the invention, it will be apparent that many modifications can be made, and it will be understood that the presently disclosed embodiment is exemplary only, and that the invention is not limited thereto. </p>
