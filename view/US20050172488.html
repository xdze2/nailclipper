                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> Nail clippers have a lower tray and side dams which extend upwardly from either side of the lower tray. A nail to be cut is positioned between the lower tray and an upper blade. The upper blade is displaced toward the lower tray, and within the side dams, until the upper blade contacts the lower tray, passing through the nail to cut the nail. A front portion of the lower tray extends outwardly and beyond the upper blade when the upper blade is closed against the tray. The nail clippers are structured to prevent injury to the skin and tissue that surrounds the fingernails and toenails to be cut. The nail clippers are particularly efficacious at cutting ingrown nails. </p>

                        <p> FIELD OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]     This invention relates to nail clippers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]     Nail clippers are known and used in the art. Nail clippers are used to trim fingernails and toenails of humans and other animals. Nail clippers as most commonly known and used in the art have an upper blade and a lower blade, which are substantially identical in architecture. The upper blade and lower blade are displaced towards each other, with the nail to be cut positioned between the blades. The blades are displaced towards each other until contact is made with the nail, and displacement is continued until the nail is divided by the blades, and the blades contact each other.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]     In nail clippers known and used in the prior art, the clippers do not provide protection from the cutting blades for skin that is in close proximity to the nail to be cut. Further, in prior art nail clippers, there is no provision for enhancing cutting performance where ingrown nails, and particularly toenails, are involved.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0004]     The present invention is nail clippers that assist in preventing injury to the skin and tissue that surround the fingernails and toenails to be cut. The nail clippers are particularly efficacious at cutting ingrown nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]     The nail clippers are characterized by a lower tray having side dams that extend upwardly from either side of the lower tray. A nail to be cut is positioned between the lower tray and an upper blade. The upper blade is displaced toward the lower tray, and within the side dams, until the upper blade contacts the lower tray, passing through the nail to cut the nail. A front portion of the lower tray extends outwardly and beyond the upper blade when the upper blade is closed against the tray.  </p>

                        <p>      DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFFERED EMBODIMENTS   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0021]     Turning now to the drawing figures, an embodiment of the present invention is shown in  FIG. 1 . The nail clippers comprise an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">upper handle  1</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lower handle  2</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">grip  3</span>  may be provided for the upper handle, and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">grip  4</span>  may be provided for the lower handle. An <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">upper blade  5</span>  communicates with the upper handle. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">lower tray  8</span>  communicates with the lower handle.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]     The lower tray has a front portion which extends beyond the upper blade when the upper blade is displaced to contact the lower tray. The upper blade is sharpened on a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">lower edge  9</span> , which contacts the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">lower tray  8</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">Side dams  6</span>  extend from each side of the lower tray. The upper blade is positioned fully within each side dam and above the lower tray. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">groove or slot  7</span>  may be formed in the lower tray to receive the upper blade.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]     Each side dam extends outwardly and beyond the tray as shown in the drawing figures. Each of the side dams extends outwardly and beyond the upper blade, when the blade is closed against the lower jaw, at an angle of 30° to 60° from a centerline drawn longitudinally, or along the length of, the nail clippers, and are preferably at an angle of 45° from a centerline drawn longitudinally, or along the length of, the nail clippers   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]     The front of the upper blade is generally perpendicular to the lower tray, so that the sharpened lower edge of the upper blade is generally perpendicular as the upper blade meets the lower tray, and/or as the upper blade meets the groove or slot that is formed in the lower tray.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]     The handles of the upper blade and the lower blade, are in a pivotal relationship to each other, as provided by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">pivot point  10</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">One side  11</span>  of the upper blade is adjacent to the side dam.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]     In the embodiment shown in  FIG. 2 , spring biasing is provided by means of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">spring  12</span>  which is attached to the upper handle and lower handle at <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">points  13</span>  and  13 ′.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]     A latch may be provided, as shown in the embodiment of  FIG. 2 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">Latch  14</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">groove  15</span>  therein in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">which pin or screw  16</span>  travels. As <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">latch  16</span>  is advanced forwardly, it strikes the upper jaw at <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">point  18</span> , to close and latch the jaw. To use the device, the latch is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">moved rearwardly toward point  17</span> , which releases the jaw.  FIG. 3A . For ease of manipulation, the edge of the latch may be scalloped and/or curved as shown. The screw may be used to hold the latch in place as desired.  FIG. 3B  shows an alternative embodiment of the latch, with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">latch  16</span>  mounted within a slot. The latch traverses the slot to lock and unlock the jaw, and limit travel of the jaw as desired.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]     In use, the lower tray is inserted underneath the nail to be cut. The front portion of the tray engages the quick of the nail, and aids in alignment. One of the side dams, depending on whether the right edge or the left edge of the nail has skin or other tissue which is to be protected, is used to protect the skin or other tissue. The use of the side dam allows the nail to rest within the side dam, while the tissue is outside the dam.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0029]     The front edge of the lower tray is preferred to be relatively thin, having a dimension of 0.015 mm to 0.040 mm from the blade to the front edge, so that it may be easily inserted underneath the nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0030]     The nail clippers cut the nail by the nail being inserted between the upper blade and the lower tray. The upper blade is disposed toward the lower tray by compression of the handles, and travels toward the lower tray and through the nail until the nail is cut. Since the front of the lower tray extends beyond the blade, and the blade is recessed within the tray, and travels within the side dams, the blade cuts the nail only, and does not cut skin or other surrounding tissue. The tray as formed, with the side dams, allows the nail to be placed within the tray, while skin and other tissue are excluded. Since the blade operates only within the tray and is not outside of the tray, or “even” with the tray, upon the nail being properly positioned, only the nail is cut by the clippers, and surrounding skin is shielded by the lower tray and the side dams.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0031]     The embodiment of  FIGS. 4 through 9  show a different handle configuration. However, the primary elements of the device are the same as those shown in  FIGS. 1 through 3 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0032]     As shown in  FIG. 4 , this embodiment provides an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper leaf  20</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower leaf  21</span>  which join each other. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">lower tray  32</span>  is provided, which has <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">side dams  22</span>  and  23 . An <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">upper handle  24</span>  is provided which allows displacement of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">leaf  2<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">0</span>  toward leaf  21</span> , in a conventional manner. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">Handle  24</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">frontal portion  25</span>  and  25 ′, and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">cam  26</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">void  27</span>  permits a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">pivot point  28</span>  for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">handle  24</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">leaf  20</span> . The handle and the upper leaf travel along a length of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">guide  29</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">Upper blade  30</span>  extends from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">leaf  20</span>  generally perpendicularly and toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">lower tray  32</span> , with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">the upper blade engaging groove or slot  31</span>  as shown in  FIGS. 6 and 7 . In this “locked” configuration, there is no gap between the blade and the lower tray. The elimination of a gap between the blade and the lower tray helps prevent the blade from tearing clothing and the like when the device is carried in a pocket in this “locked” position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0033]      FIG. 10  through  FIG. 14  show an additional embodiment of the invention. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">blade  102</span>  in this embodiment is pivotally mounted to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">upper jaw  104</span> . The blade pivots relative to the upper jaw at a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">pivot point  106</span> , so that the blade is generally vertical at all times as it travels relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">lower tray  108</span> , and while the lower tray is in the generally horizontal position shown in  FIG. 11  through  FIG. 13 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0034]     As shown in  FIG. 11 , the upper jaw is displaced fully toward the lower tray. The blade engages the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">slot  110</span>  within the lower tray. In this embodiment, each of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">side dams  112</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">guide  114</span>  formed therein in which the blade travels. In a preferred embodiment, the guide is a slot that is formed in the side dams by an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">extension  116</span>  that is present on the upper portion of the side dams. As the upper jaw moves toward the lower jaw, the blade strikes the bottom of the groove and limits the travel of the blade. However, if blade breaks, the upper jaw strikes the lower jaw as shown in  FIG. 11 , limiting the travel of the upper jaw. In this way, a toe inserted between the jaws is not injured by the jaws if the blade breaks.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0035]      FIG. 12  shows the blade in an intermediate position relative to the lower tray. The blade travels within the slot formed within the side dam, which may be provided by the extension in each of the side dams that are formed in the upper part of the side dam, but not the lower part of the side dams, so that they do not interfere with the insertion of the nail between the lower tray and side dam. The slot guides the blade so that it maintains its generally perpendicular position relative to the lower tray. The pivotal mounting of the blade relative to the upper jaw allows the blade to maintain the generally perpendicular position by allowing he angle between the upper jaw and the blade to change as the upper jaw travels relative to the lower tray. This is further demonstrated by  FIG. 13 , wherein the upper jaw is fully retracted from the lower tray and the nail clippers are in the full open position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0036]     As shown in  FIG. 14 , when the nail clippers are in the fully open position, the blade may be removed sliding it out and away from the pivotal mounting. The blade may then be replaced, or perhaps sharpened, as needed.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0037]     As shown in the embodiment of  FIG. 10  through  FIG. 14 , the pivotal mounting that provides the pivoting relationship between the upper jaw and lower tray is comprised of an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem118">axle  118</span> , and controlled by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">guide  120</span> . The travel of the guide is directed by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124">slot  124</span> , which forces the upper jaw forward as the upper jaw raises, and retracts it rearwardly as the upper jaw is displaced down and toward the lower tray. This guide maintains the forward end of upper jaw, where the blade is mounted, directly above the guide for the blade that is present in the side dams, whether the nail clippers are fully closed ( FIG. 11 ), in an intermediate position ( FIG. 12 ) or in a fully open position ( FIG. 13 ).   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0038]     In order for the guide to control the position of the upper jaw relative to the lower tray, the axle must traverse a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">slot  122</span> . This feature is demonstrated as the nail clippers move through the positions shown progressively in  FIG. 11 ,  FIG. 12  and  FIG. 13 . The axle moves from a rearward position to an intermediate position to a full forward position as the guide controls the movement of the upper jaw relative to the lower tray. In the preferred embodiment, the axle has a flat upper surface and a flat lower, and opposite, surface. The flat surfaces provide a larger surface for the substantial loads or pressures that are placed upon the axle when the nail clippers are in the fully closed position, and pressure is applied to cut a nail, such a dense toenail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0039]     Nails are typically curved at the end. The lower tray has a convex upper surface over which the nail is received for cutting.  FIG. 14 . The curved lower tray provides support for the nail as the end of the nail is severed by the blade, providing a more efficient cut. The upper blade has a concave shape at the edge of the blade that conforms to the geometry of the lower tray, with substantially the same arc as the lower tray so that the blade contacts the lower tray at all points to cut the nail. </p>
