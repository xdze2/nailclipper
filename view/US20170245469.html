                        <p>      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    The present invention relates to a pet nail clipper and, more particularly, to a pet nail clipper with a deburring plate and a styptic receptacle.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    Pets have either nails or claws that enable them to climb, defend themselves and catch prey. Since most pets, such as dogs, cats, birds, and other small critters do not use nails or claws like they do in the wild, their nails or claws continue to grow. A groomer or owner of the pet must regularly inspect and trim the nails or claws. Overgrown nails can cause damage to the skin and personal belongings of the pet owner. Also, long nails can curl around if left unattended and lead to a painful embedded Therefore, nails need to be cut and filed. If the nail begins to bleed, the nail may be submerged in a styptic material.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    As can be seen, there is a need for a pet nail clipper that clips nails, files nails and readily provides a styptic material.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0023]    The following detailed description is of the best currently contemplated modes of carrying out exemplary embodiments of the invention. The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention, since the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    The present invention provides for a convenient way of clipping a dog, cat or any small animal&#39;s nails, filing the nails and stopping the nail from hemorrhaging if needed. The present invention may include a first handle with an integrated stainless steel file used to shave down the nail. The present invention may further include stainless steel blades used to cut nails. A second handle may include a loop that retains a disposable styptic powder cartridge. A bolt and screw may pivotally connect both handles and blades together. A spring biases the handles and blades apart. A disposable styptic powder cartridge is secured within the loop. A locking latch may be used to close clippers when not in use. A thin rubber silicone cap may be secured to the cartridge. A thin foil may be disposed under the rubber silicone cap.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]    To use the invention, grab the clippers with one hand. By squeezing the handles together, the stainless-steel blades cut the nails. Once the nails are cut, use the integrated stainless steel file to trim down burrs left behind from cutting the nails. The spring allows the blades to reset to be used again. If the nail happens to hemorrhage, use the disposable styptic cartridge to stop the bleeding. Penetrate the rubber silicone cap with the nail to get passed the thin foil and into the cup that holds the styptic powder. Allow the nail to sit in powder for a few minutes to stop the bleeding.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]    Referring to  FIGS. 1 through 15 , the present invention includes a pet nail clipper. The pet nail clipper includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">upper arm  10</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">lower arm  20</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">upper arm  10</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">handle portion  14</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">cutting portion  12</span>  having a blade. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">lower arm  20</span>  also includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">handle portion  24</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">cutting portion  22</span>  having a blade. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">pivot bolt  46</span>  pivotally connects the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">upper arm  10</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">lower arm  20</span>  together in between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">handle portions  14</span> ,  24  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">cutting portions  12</span> ,  22 . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">spring  30</span>  is attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">upper arm  10</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">lower arm  20</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">spring  30</span>  may fit within an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">upper cavity  16</span>  formed on an underside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">upper arm  10</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lower cavity  26</span>  formed on an underside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">lower arm  20</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">spring  30</span>  biases the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">handle portions  14</span> ,  24  away from one another and biases the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">cutting portions  12</span> ,  22  away from one another. A user may place the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">cutting portions  12</span> ,  22  over a tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail  40</span> , squeeze the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">handle portions  14</span> ,  24  together, and cut the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail  40</span>  to form a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">flat surface  52</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]    The pet nail clippers may further retain a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">receptacle  32</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">receptacle  32</spa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">n>  may house styptic liquid or powder  38</span> . In such embodiments, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">receptacle bracket  18</span>  extends laterally from at least one of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">upper arm  10</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">lower arm  20</span> . For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">receptacle bracket  18</span>  may extend laterally from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">handle portion  14</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">upper arm  10</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">receptacle bracket  18</span>  may include a plate with a looped inner edge forming an opening. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">receptacle  32</span>  may include a rounded sidewall that fits within and releasably retains to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">receptacle bracket  18</span> . In certain embodiments, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">lid  34</span>  may be secured to an upper edge of the sidewall of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">receptacle  32</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">lid  34</span>  may be made of a material having a rubber elasticity, such as silicone, rubber and the like. At least one slit, such as crisscrossing slits, may be formed through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">lid  34</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">seal  36</span>  may cover the receptacle underneath the lid prior to use. If a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">quick  44</span>  is cut, the groomer may easily place the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">nail casing  42</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail  40</span>  through the slits and into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">styptic liquid or powder  38</span> , which stops the bleeding.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]    In certain embodiments, the present invention further includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">deburring plate  28</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">deburring plate  28</span>  is secured to at least one of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">upper arm  10</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">lower arm  20</span> . For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">deburring plate  28</span>  may be secured to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">handle portion  24</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">lower arm  20</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">deburring plate  28</span>  may include a metal plate having an inner surface secured to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">handle portion  24</span>  and an outer abrasive or course surface. After the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail  40</span>  has been clipped, the groomer may grind an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">edge  48</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">outer casing  42</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail  40</span>  to further smoothen and round the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">nail  50</span> .  </p>
