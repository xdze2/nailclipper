Oates, Jr., 800 S. Pine St., Rocky Mount, N.C. 27801 Filed May 28, 1965, Ser. No. 459,742 3 Claims. (Cl. 30-28) The present invention generally relates to a device for clipping cuticles, hangnails and the like and may be constructed as an independent clipper or combined with a fingernail clipper so that a person utilizing such a device may not only clip their fingernails but also clip their cuticles and hangnails if such are present.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   An object of the present invention is to provide a clipper including a pair of cooperating cutting elements that are urged towards each other by an operating lever employing a fulcruming action. In order to effectively clip cuticles, the bottom element of the clipper is substantially straight longitudinally for orientation along the top surface of a fingernail. The end edge of the bottom cutting element is curved in a convex nature for conforming generally with the curvature of the cuticle around the edge of the fingernail. Also, the bottom cutting element is transversely curved in a concave manner to further enhance its conformance with the transverse curvature of the top surface of a fingernail so that the bottom cutting element may be orientated in an optimum position for sliding slightly under the cuticle for clipping thereof. The end edge of the bottom cutting member is beveled along its bottom edge for easier insertion under the cuticle. The upper cutting element is provided with a depending cutting element that is curved in conformity with and complementary to the bottom cutting element for association therewith so that a cuticle, hangnail or the like disposed against the top surface of the bottom cutting member will be effectively severed by the top cutting member when it is forced downwardly into engagement therewith by the fulcruming action of the operating lever. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a clipper for cuticles, hangnails or the like that is particularly constructed in accordance with the foregoing but yet which is relatively simple in construction, easy to use, effective for its particular purposes and relatively inexpensive to manufacture.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a clipper in accordance with the preceding paragraph that is combined with a fingernail clipper of more or less conventional construction with the fingernail clipper and cuticle clipper being orientated in end to end relation with the ends of the operating levers being disposed in overlapping nested relationship to each other and engaged with a &#39;stationary pin which will effectively releasably retain the operating levers in their inoperative position in superimposed relationship to each other.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Still another important object of-the present invention is to provide a combined fingernail clipper and cuticle clipper having a file associated with the bottom member thereof which is substantially fiat for positioning under the bottom surface of the bottom member or projecting longitudinally therefrom in an operative condition with means being provided for releasably securing the file in its&#39;two positions thereby providing a combination&#39;implement for clipping the fingernails, filing the fingernails, cutting cuticles, cutting hangnails or the like with the implement being easily operated by the individual user as easily and efficiently in one hand as the other.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   These together with other objects and advantages which will become subsequently apparent reside in the details of construction and operation as more fully hereinafter described and claimed, reference being had to the accompanying drawings forming a part hereof, wherein like numerals refer to like parts throughout, and in which:   </p>

                        <p>   FIGURE 6 is a side elevational view illustrating a cuticle clipper constructed in accordance with the present invention without it being combined with the fingernail clipper; and   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIGURE 7 is an end view of the construction of FIGURE 6.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring now specifically to the drawings, the numeral 10 generally designates the combined cuticle clipper and fingernail clipper of the present invention with the cuticle clipper construction being orientated at one end thereof l and designated by the numeral 12 and the fingernail clipper construction being orientated at the other end and being designated by the numeral 14.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The combined cuticle clipper and fingernail clipper includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> single -bottom member 16</span> having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> flat lower surface 18</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> correspondingly fiat upper surface 20</span>. At the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cuticle clipper end 12</span> of the implement, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> bottom member 16</span> is beveled or tapered upwardly and outwardly as at 22 and is conveXly `rounded as at 24 as illustrated in FIGURE 5. Further, the end portion vof the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> bottom member 16</span> is transversely concave as indicated by the numeral 26 and as illustrated in FIGURE 4 and FIGURE 2 with this construction enabling the bottom surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> bottom member 16</span> to conform to the natural curvature of the top surface of a fingernail when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> bottom member 16</span> is orientated generally in longitudinal alignment with the fingernail and against the top surface thereof.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Projecting upwardly from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> bottom member 16</span> adjacent. the cutting end edge thereof is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> pin 28</span> which has its head countersunk into and iiush with the bottom surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> bottom mem-ber 16</span> thereby eliminating any projections and providing a completely smooth eX- ternal or bottom surface to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> bottom member 16</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> pin 28</span> projects upwardly through an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> opening 30</span> in an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> upper cutting member 32</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> pin 28</span> terminates in an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> upwardly inclined slot 34</span> for receiving a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> transverse bar 36</span> on an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> operating lever 38</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> operating lever 38</span> is provided with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> opening 40</span> adjacent the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> bar 36</span> s0 that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> bar 36</span> may be engaged and disengaged with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> inclined notch 34</span> by deflecting the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> upper cutting member 32</span> towards the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> bottom member 16</span>. Also, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> operating lever 38</span> is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> projection 42</span> forming a fulcruming point in movable engagement with the upper surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> upper cutting member 32</span> so that when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> operating lever 38</span> is in the position illustratedV in FIGURE 4, downward pressure on theA free end thereof will cause the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> upper cutting member 32</span> to move towards the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> bottom member 16</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The outer end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> upper cutting mem-ber 32</span> is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> depending cutting blade or element 44</span> that is provided with a sharpened lower edge that is concavely curved from edge to edge to conform with the curvature of the upper surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> lower cutting member 16</span> at the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> clipper end 12</span> of the implement, which end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> member 16</span> is transversely concaved as previously set forth at 26. The concave curvaturev of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> itting blade or element 44</span> is designated at 46 and also,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">   </p>
                    
                        <p>  e cutting element 44</span> is transversely convexly curved at 48 for conforming with the convex rounded edge l of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> bottom cutting member 16</span>. Thus, when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> Jerating lever 38</span> is orientated in the position illustrated FIGURE 4 and the free end thereof is depressed, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">   </p>

                        <p>   Orientated below the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> bottom cutting member 16</span> is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> file member 76</span> having<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78"> roughened surface areas 78</span> which are conventional in such a file and the headed end of the pin S0 is countersunk in the file and the portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> file 76</span> adjacent the outer edge thereof is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80"> projection 80</span> for engagement with one of a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82"> diametrically opposed indentations 82</span> formed in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> bottom member 16</span> for resiliently retaining the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> file 76</span> in either its inoperative position along the undersurface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> bottom member 16</span> or in its operative position with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> file 76</span> forming a longitudinal extension of the combined cuticle and fingernail clipper.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIGURES 6 and 7 illustrate an embodiment of the invention designated by numeral 110 which is in the form of a cuticle clipper alone and which includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116"> bottom cutting member 116</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem132"> top cutting member 132</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116"> bottom cutting member 116</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122"> slightly beveled surface 122</span> and is transversely flat but curved convexly in a horizontal plane as designated at 124. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem132"> top cutting member 132</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem144"> depending cutting member 144</span> integral therewith and provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem146"> sharpened lower edge 146</span> which is straight transversely but which is arcuately convexly curved as at 148. An<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem138"> operating lever 138</span> which is the same as the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> operating lever 38</span> is provided except that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem138"> operating lever 138</span> is substantially straight but slightly curved.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem142"> kA fulcruming member 142</span> is provided on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem138"> operating lever 138</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem138"> operating lever 138</span> is detachably and pivotally connected to a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> swivel pin 1</span>.28 whichl is substantially the same as the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> swivel pin 28</span> in the structure illustrated in FIGURES 1 5. The ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem132">g members 116 and 132</span></span> remote from the cutting elements are xedly interconnected by a rivet type fastener, spot welding or the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem170"> like 170</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem170"> rivet type fastener 170</span> also secures a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem176"> tile member 176</span> against the upper surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem132"> top cutting member 132</span> so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem176"> file 176</span> may be orientated in the inoperative position illustrated in FIGURE 6 or swung around to the operative position as an extension of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> clipper 110</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The clipper which is provided with the transversely fiat cutting elements may alternatively be oonstructed with the transversely concave cutting surfaces as illustrated in FIGURES l-S. Also the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cuticle clipper 12</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> combined clipper 10</span> illustrated in FIGURES 1-5 may have a transversely flat cutting edge construction. Thus, the cuticle clipper may be constructed as an independent device or may be constructed in combination with a fingernail clipper and in either arrangement would have a file associated therewith. Additionally, the cuticle clipper in either arrangement may have the transversely curvedv cutting surfaces or the transversely straight cutting surfaces but in both instances would have the longitudinally convex edges for conforming with the longitudinal curvature of the cuticle at the inner edge of the fingernail. The components of the cuticle clipper will be constructed of materials conventionally employed in fingernail clippers of a conventional type with the materials being commensurate with the forces necessary to effectively clip the cuticles, fingernails and the like.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In each form of the invention, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem79"> rounded beveled end 79</span> of the file member serves to lift the edge of the cuticle so that it can be easily clipped.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention as claimed.   </p>
