Said tool includes<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> two el<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">ongated leaves 12, 14</span></span> of metallic spring stock, e. g. steel, which run from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> rear 16</span> to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> front 18</span> of the tool. Conveniently, the leaves have substantially identical configurations and their edges are in registration.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Intermediate the two leaves there is disposed an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> elongated strip 20</span> of resilient metal stock hereinafter referred to as the back spacer.&#34; The back spacer extends longitudinally from adjacent the rear of the tool to near the front thereof. Means is provided suitable to secure the back spacer to one or the other of the leaves, e. g. the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> leaf 12</span>, along the forward half only of the spacer. For this purpose,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> I provide two rivets 22</span> which extend through pairs of registered openings in the back spacer and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> leaf 12</span>. One of these rivets is located near the front end of the back spacer and the other near the center. Thus, the   </p>
                    
                        <p>  rear half of the back spacer is left free and can be flexed relative to the front half.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   For the sake of appearance, one longitudinal edge of the back spacer runs parallel to one set of registered longitudinal. edges of the leaves, this edge of the spacer either being in registry with said, set of edges of the leaves or inset slightly therefrom as shown .in Figs. 3, 4, and 6.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A pivot such as a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> pin 24</span> extends through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> registered openings 26</span> in the leaves adjacent the rear ends thereof. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> central portion 28</span> of the pin is of cylindrical transverse cross-section and has a diameter in excess of a transverse dimension of the portions of the pins passing through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> openings 26</span> whereby to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> form shoulders 30</span> at opposite ends of said central portion against which the leaves bear. i   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The lengthv of the central portion from shoulder to shoulder is equal to the thickness of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> back spacer 20</span> so that when the ends of the pin engage the leaves, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> compartment 32</span> is provided between the leaves alongside the back spacer. The compartment opens at the side of the nippers remote from the back spacer.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The ends of the pin are suitably secured to the leaves in such fashion that the leaves cannot experience angular movement with respect to one another about the pin and cannot move relative to the pin adjacent their rear ends. For this purpose, I include<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> counter-sunk indentations 34</span> in the exposed surfaces of the leaves around the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> openings 26</span>. The pin is headed at both ends for reception in said counter-sunk indentations. The indentations are of noncircular outline and the headed portions of the pin snugly fit in the indentations whereby the leaves are unable to rotate with respect to the pin.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> conventional knife blade 36</span> is disposed in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> com partment 32</span>. Said blade runs longitudinally of the compartment with its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> cutting edge 38</span> alongside the back spacer and slightly spaced therefrom when the blade is in closed position. The blade also includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> conventional tang 40</span> having flat parallel broad surfaces and a through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> aperture 42</span>. The central portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> pin 24</span> extends through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> aperture 42</span> which thereby acts as a pivot for the knife blade. The blade thickness is almost equal to the length of the central portion of the pin so that the blade is free to rotate about the pin.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> rear end 44</span> of the tang is straight. The upper an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> lower <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">edges 46, 48</span></span> of the tang likewise are straight, and are approximately perpendicular to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> rear edge 44</span>. The distance from the pin to each of said<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> edges <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">44, 46,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> 48</span></span></span> is substantially the same and is somewhat greater than the distance from said pin to the nearest portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> back spacer 20</span> when the spacer is relaxed.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   When the knife is in closed position as shown in Fig. 3, it will be held there by pressure of the back spacer against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> flat edge 46</span>. Similar pressure against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> edge 44</span> will maintain the knife in half-open position against accidental displacement; and the same action against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> edge 48</span> will maintain the blade in the fully open position shown in dot-and-dash line in Fig. 1 against the accidental closing movement. The pressure described also will tend to bias the knife blade into any one of the mentioned position as that position is approached.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> corners 50</span> at the ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> rear edge 44</span> are rounded to facilitate opening and closing movement of the blade.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> shoulder 52</span> between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> edge 48</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> blunt back edge 54</span> of the blade is adapted to abut against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> rear edge 56</span> of the back spacer when the blade is in fully open position (see Fig. 4).   </p>
                    
                        <p>   By virtue of the foregoing arrangement. the blade, when in folded, i. e. closed, position, lies substantially flat against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> leaf 12</span> to which the back spacer is permanently secured. As is best seen in Fig. 5, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> leaf 12</span> is 0 substantially straight and is so maintained by the back tion of...the....leaf .12 although, their rear ends, are held against the blade by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> pin 24</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> post 58</span> extends through an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> opening 60</span> in the forampbawnasef &#39;the&#39;leaf12. Said post has anenlar&#39;ged liead &#39;62 whichis adapted to engagethe outer surfaces the 1&#39;eaf12. &#34;Th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">epost also extends througha&#39;n opening 64</span> &#39;i&#39;n&#39;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> thelaf 14</span>, said opening being somewhat larger than the diameter of&#39;t he postwhereby to permit flexing fr&#39;iovme&#39;nt of&#39;the&#39;l&#39;eaf&#39;14 about its anchor point on the pin i4. &#34;The&#39;po&#39;stin&#39;cludes a side opening notch &#39;66 having an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> upwardl-yextehding undercut 68</span> located below the upper T651514 &#34;when said lBElflS relaxed.   </p>

                        <p>   Itiwill be&#39;observed that&#39;the blade is conveniently concealed between the two leaves when in cl&#39;osed&#39;position and thus does not interfere with &#39;the&#39;flexibility ofthe leaf that isiope&#39;rate&#39;d bythe actuating lever. However, when the lack is&#39;opened, the twole aves form astur dyhandle for mariipulation&#39;of the blade.   </p>
