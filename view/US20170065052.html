                        <p> REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    This application claims the priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/214,191 filed on Sep. 3, 2015, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.  </p>
                    
                        <p>       </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    The present invention relates to a nail clipper having a gap-adjustable cutting jaw capable of adjusting the gap of the upper and lower jaws so as to allow the user to cut nail having a wider thickness range.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0003]    Nail clippers typically include first and second plate members of metal material that are joined together at one end, and having a pair of jaw portions at the opposite end thereof, and an operating lever coupled to the plate members for moving the jaws from an open position to a nail cutting position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    In order to accomplish the nail cutting operation, conventional nail clippers include a hook member of cylindrical shape which is coupled to a front side of the first and second plate members and to which the operating lever is engaged to provide a leverage action to cut nails inserted between the jaw members. More specifically, the cylindrical hook member includes a hooking groove formed at an upper side of the hook member, and a front tip portion of the operating layer is engaged to the hooking groove to carry out the leverage action magnifying the cutting force of the jaws. Since such nail clippers have a single hooking groove, the gap between the upper and lower jaws of the conventional nail clippers is set to a fixed size depending on the design of the nail clippers. Thus, common nails clippers have a limited gap size, and they cannot effectively be used to cut nails of greater thickness, such as abnormally grown finger or toe nails, thicker toe nails, and toe nails grown excessively or deformed greatly. Consequently, it is necessary to use another nail clipper of bigger size with a bigger gap size to cut such nails of greater thickness, and thus, requiring multiple nail clippers to cover the necessary thickness range of their nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0005]    Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problems or shortcomings occurring in the prior art nail clippers, and the present invention is contemplated to provide a nail clipper which is reliable and durable in structure, while also allowing the user to easily adjust the cutting gap of the nail clipper by simple gap adjusting operation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    The nail clipper of the present invention utilizes a hook member having a specially designed shape to easily realize the gap adjusting operation by the user, and the front portion of the operating layer of the nail clipper has a specially configured structure enabling its coupling function with the hook member for nail cutting operation and the gap adjusting operation as well.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    Accordingly, the nail clipper of the present invention can be used to cover a wide thickness range of people&#39;s nails, including nails of small or normal thickness, as well as the nails of greater thickness or abnormal shape such as deformed or bent nails, only with simple gap adjusting operation that can be easily performed by an average layperson without difficulty.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    According to one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the nail clipper comprises:  </p>

                        <p>        [0016]    Referring to the drawings, the nail clippers of the present invention are described herein in detail in association with exemplary or currently preferred embodiments thereof. However, the following descriptions of such embodiments are intended primarily for illustrating the principles and exemplary constructions of the nail clippers of the present invention, and the present invention is not specifically limited to these exemplary embodiments. Thus, one skilled in the art can appreciate or recognize that various modifications and substitutions can be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Throughout the disclosure, the same or similar elements and portions thereof are referred and described with the same reference characters for the simplicity and illustrative purposes.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0017]    With reference to  FIGS. 1 and 2 , the nail clipper according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention is described herein below. As depicted in the drawings, the nail clipper includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">first clipper body member  102</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">second clipper body member  104</span>  coupled together at a rear end (e.g., a right end in the drawings shown) by a pin member or other known coupling elements (not shown), such as pins, rivets, coupling screws, and the like. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">body members  102</span>  and  104  have a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">first cutting jaw  106</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">second cutting jaw  108</span> , respectively, at a front end thereof, and are configured to cut nails in cooperation with an operating lever (to be described below) upon operation. These <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">body members  102</span>  and  104  are configured such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">cutting jaws  106</span>  and  108  are normally in a spaced apart relationship, and can be moved into a cutting position as the user operates the nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0018]    For clipping operation, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipper  100</span>  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">operating lever  110</span>  connected to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">pin or hook member  120</span>  which extends through a set of bores formed at the front end portion of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">second clipper body members  102</span>  and  104 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">hook member  120</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">cylindrical shaft  122</span>  for coupling to the bores of the clipper body members, and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124">flange  124</span>  for abutting the bottom surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">second clipper body member  104</span>  as shown. In cutting operation, the frontal tip area of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  contacts the upper surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">first body member  102</span>  to provide a leverage effect, and is capable of operating the jaw portions to move towards each other to cut or trim a desired object (e.g., finger nails or toe nails) inserted between the jaw portions.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">hook member  120</span>  is formed preferably of metallic or composite materials, and includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">hooking groove  126</span>  with specially designed groove configuration for enabling the gap adjustment operation to adjust the gap of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">cutting jaws  106</span>  and  108  by the user, and a distal tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  is engaged to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">hooking groove  126</span>  in a manner to be described below. As specifically shown in  FIG. 3 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">hooking groove  126</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">vertical groove portion  126</span>   a  extending vertically downwardly from the upper surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">hook member  120</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">groove end face  126</span>   b,  a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">first lateral groove portion  126</span>   c  extending in a lateral direction from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">vertical groove portion  126</span>   a,  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">second lateral groove portion  126</span>   d  extending in a lateral direction from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">vertical groove portion  126</span>   a.  According to the preferred embodiment as shown in the drawings, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">first lateral groove portion  126</span>   c  extends in a diagonally upward direction (preferably with inclination of 15-75 degree) orienting toward the rear end of the nail clipper when assembled, and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">second lateral groove portion  126</span>   d  extends in a diagonally upward direction (preferably with inclination of 15-75 degree) orienting toward the front end of the nail clipper when assembled, as shown in  FIGS. 1 and 2 . However, it is specifically noted that the shapes and extending directions of the first and second lateral groove portions are not limited thereto. For example, the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">second lateral groove portions  126</span>   c  and  126   d  may extend in a horizontal direction, or in a diagonally upward direction with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> inclination less than 15</span> degree (°).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]    The dimension of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">hook member  120</span>  as well as the length and width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">groove portions  126</span>   a,    126   c,  and  126   d  are selected to provide multiple gap sizes (e.g., a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> normal gap G 1</span>  and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> wider gap G 2</span> ) between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">jaws  106</span>  and  108  to be in a suitable range to cover a normal thickness and a wider thickness of the nails of the users. More specifically, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">cylindrical shaft  122</span>  has a diameter “d” which is preferably in a range from ⅛ inch to 6/16 inch, and each of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">vertical groove portion  126</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">lateral groove portions  126</span>   c  and  126   d  has a groove width “t” which is preferably in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> range from 1</span>/32 inch to 3/32 inch. The length “h” from the upper surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124">flange  124</span>  to the upper tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">cylindrical body  122</span>  is preferably in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> range from 7</span>/16 inch to 15/16 inch, The length “a” from the upper surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124">flange  124</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">groove end face  126</span>   b  is preferably in a range from ¼ inch to ½ inch, and the length “b” from the upper surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124">flange  124</span>  to the upper tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">first lateral groove portion  126</span>   c  is preferably in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> range from 6</span>/16 inch to 10/16 inch, and the length “c” from the upper surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124">flange  124</span>  to the upper tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">second lateral groove portion  126</span>   d  is preferably in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> range from 8</span>/16 inch to 12/16 inch.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">operating lever  110</span>  is formed preferably of a thin metallic material, and includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">lever body portion  112</span>  onto which a thumb of the user is placed to hold and operate the nail clipper, and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">tip portion  114</span>  extending in an angled or inclined direction from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">lever body  112</span> . As shown in  FIG. 5 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">tip portion  114</span>  includes a pair of o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">pposing rim or circumferential portions  114</span>   a  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">front bar portion  114</span>   b,  and thereby, defining therein a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">coupling hole  116</span>  of generally D-shape, or rectangular, or track-shape with two opposing parallel sides. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">front bar portion  114</span>   b  is formed into a generally linearly extending bar or similar shape, and has a dimension (e.g., width and thickness) suitable for slidably inserting and coupling to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">vertical groove portion  126</span>   a  as well as <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">lateral groove portions  126</span>   c  and  126   d.  According to one preferred embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">front bar portion  114</span>   b  has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> width “t 1</span> ” and a thickness about the same or slightly smaller than the width “t” of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">groove portions  126</span>   a,    126   c ,  126   d  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">hook member  120</span> . Thus, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">front bar portion  114</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  can be slidably inserted to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">vertical groove  126</span>   a,  then into a selected one of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">lateral grooves  126</span>   c  and  126   d  for coupling thereto upon selection of the user. The D-shaped (<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">or generally rectangular) coupling hole  116</span>  of the lever has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> diameter “d 1</span> ” (i.e., the distance between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">two parallel rims  114</span>   a ) which is about the same or slightly larger than the diameter “d” of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">cylindrical shaft  122</span> , and a width “W” which is about the same or slightly smaller than the diameter “d” of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">cylindrical shaft  122</span>  in light of the required allowance enabling the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">cylindrical shaft  122</span>  to be displaced within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">coupling hole  116</span>  during the gap adjustment operation for moving the position of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">operating lever  110</span>  by the user .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]    In order to initially assemble the nail clipper into a first position having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> normal (or smaller) gap size “G 1</span> ” with the frontal tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  coupled to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">first lateral groove portion  126</span>   c,  the user first aligns the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">front bar portion  114</span>   b  of the operating lever with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">vertical groove portion  126</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">hook member  120</span> , and pushes the tip portion to slide downwardly along the vertical groove and against the first clipper body member which is elastically biased upwardly, while pulling the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">lever  120</span>  in a rearward direction toward the rear side of the clipper. This causes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">front bar portion  114</span>   b  to engage with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">first lateral groove portion  126</span>   c  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">front bar portion  114</span>   b  is aligned with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">first lateral groove portion  126</span>   c.  As such, the users can easily assemble the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">hook member  120</span>  of the nail clipper with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> normal or smaller clipper gap (G 1</span> ), and the frontal tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  is securely coupled to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">first lateral groove portion  126</span>   c,  as shown in  FIG. 1 . Here, as the frontal tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  is tightly caught in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">first lateral groove portion  126</span>   c  (see  FIG. 1 ) due to the upwardly-biasing spring force of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">first clipper body member  102</span> , it cannot easily escape therefrom unless the user applies a sufficient force to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">operating lever  110</span>  in a frontward direction (that is, leftward in the drawings) to move the front tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  out of the groove while pressing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">first clipper body member  102</span>  downward against its elastic spring force. In this manner, the nail clipper can be readily assembled to have a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> first gap size (G 1</span> ) to cut nails having normal or smaller thicknesses, and it can reliably be used without the risk of accidental disassembling.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]    To the contrary, in order to assemble the nail clipper into a second position having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> larger gap size “G 2</span> ” with the frontal tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  coupled to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">second lateral groove portion  126</span>   d,  the user first aligns the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">front bar portion  114</span>   b  of the operating lever with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">vertical groove portion  126</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">hook member  120</span> , and pushes the tip portion to slide downwardly along the vertical groove against the first clipper body member which is elastically biased upwardly, while also pushing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">lever  120</span>  in a frontward direction toward the front side of the clipper. This causes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">front bar portion  114</span>   b  to engage with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">second lateral groove portion  126</span>   d  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">front bar portion  114</span>   b  is aligned with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">second lateral groove portion  126</span>   d.  As such, the users can easily assemble the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">hook member  120</span>  of the nail clipper with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> wider clipper gap (G 2</span> ) and the frontal tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  is securely coupled to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">second lateral groove portion  126</span>   d,  as shown in  FIG. 2 . Here, as the frontal tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  is caught in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">second lateral groove portion  126</span>   d  (see  FIG. 2 ) with a p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">rotruded tip “ 126</span>   t ” (see  FIG. 3 ) engaging to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">coupling hole  116</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">front bar portion  114</span>   b  as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">first clipper body member  102</span>  applies the upwardly-biasing spring force, the frontal tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  cannot easily escape from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">second lateral groove portion  126</span>   d  unless the user applies a sufficient force in a rearward direction (that is, rightward in the drawings) to move the front tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  out of the groove while pressing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">first clipper body member  102</span>  downward against its elastic spring force. In this manner, the nail clipper can be readily assembled to have a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> second gap size (G 2</span> ) to cut nails having larger thicknesses, and it can reliably be used without the risk of accidental disassembling.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    In addition, the users can also easily change the gap size of the nail clipper between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> normal/smaller size (G 1</span> ) and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> wider size (G 2</span> ) whenever desired, by first unlocking the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">front bar portion  114</span>   b  out of the currently coupled one of the first and second lateral grooves, and then shifting to engage with the other lateral groove which is free. For example, in order to unlock and shift the engagement from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">first lateral groove  126</span>   c  of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> normal/smaller size (G 1</span> ) to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">second lateral groove  126</span>   d  of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> wider size (G 2</span> ), the user needs to push the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">operating lever  110</span>  in a front ward direction to unlock the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">operating lever  110</span>  from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">first groove  126</span>   c,  and leaves the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">front bar portion  114</span>   b  to engage to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">second groove  126</span>   d  with the aid of the elastic spring force of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">first clipper body member  102</span> . Likewise, in order to unlock and shift the engagement from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">second lateral groove  126</span>   d  of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> wider size (G 2</span> ) to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">first lateral groove  126</span>   c  of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> normal/smaller size (G 1</span> ), the user needs to pull the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">operating lever  110</span>  in a rearward direction to unlock the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">operating lever  110</span>  from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">second groove  126</span>   d,  and presses the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">front bar portion  114</span>   b  downward against the elastic spring force of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first clipper body member  10</span>  to have the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">front bar portion  114</span>   b  engaged to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">first gro<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ove  126</span>   c    2</span> . As such, the gap shifting operation can be performed by layperson without difficulties.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]    It is further noted that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">operating lever  110</span>  can be rotated between the operating position (shown in  FIGS. 1 and 2 ) and the retracted or storing position with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">operating lever  110</span>  turned upside down (not shown) in such a manner similar to conventional nail clippers. This is enabled by pivotally rotating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">hook member  120</span>  by 180 degree using the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">operation lever  110</span>  and then rotating the same upside down. Further detailed descriptions of this lever flipping feature is omitted herein, and one of ordinary skill in the art may readily recognize how this lever position conversion is possible upon examining the structures of the nail clipper of the present invention disclosed above, and further in view of the structures of well-known and readily available conventional nail clippers having similar lever flipping function.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]    As described above in connection with exemplary embodiments thereof, the present invention is contemplated to provide a nail clipper which is reliable and durable in structure, while also allowing the user to easily adjust the cutting gap of the nail clipper by simple gap adjusting operation to accommodate nails with a wide thickness range, both having smaller or normal thicknesses as well as larger thicknesses.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]    The above disclosed embodiments of the invention are representatives of a presently preferred form of the invention, but are intended to be illustrative rather than definitive thereof. Accordingly, those skilled in the art will appreciate or recognize that various modifications and substitutions can be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as set forth in the appended claims. </p>
