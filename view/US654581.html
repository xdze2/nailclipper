                        <p>  I Application filed January 24, 1900. Serial No. 2,591. (No model.)   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, BERNHARD WAGNER, a citizen of the United States, residing at Rahway, in the county of Union and Stateof New Jersey, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Devices for Removing Corns from the Human Foot, of which the following is a full and complete specification, such as will enable those skilled in the art to which.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Fig. 3, a plan view of a detail of the construetion shown in. Figs. 1 and 2.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In the practice of my invention I provide,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> base 5</span>, which may consist of a block of wood or other material and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> nether surface 6</span> of which is curved convexlyfi A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> support or standard 7</span> projects from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> base 5</span>, and connected with theouter end portion thereof is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> yoke-shaped support 8</span>, in which is journaled a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> spindle 9</span>, and fixed to the spindle- 9 within the yoke-<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">shaped supportB is&#39;a cylindrical body 9</span>, which is pre- Vented from lateral movement by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> collars 11</span>, arranged at either side thereof upon the spindle within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> support 8</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> spindle 9</span> is provided with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> end piece 12</span>, by which it may be conveniently turned, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> cylindrical body 9</span> carries a plurality of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> transverse peripheral blades 13</span>, which project approximately tangentiallytherefrom and are preferably struck up&#39;from a strip of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> metal 10</span>, as shown clearly in Fig. 3, and which is connected with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> body 9</span> by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> projections 13</span> at one end which are passed through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> openings 13</span> at the other end.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the use of the form of construction shown in Figs. 1 and 2 the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> base 5</span>, and preferably the convex surface thereof, is rested-upon the foot or upon any other convenient support adjacent the corn, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> cylindrical body 10</span> is broughtinto operative position above or otherwise contiguous to the corn, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> spindle 9</span> is revolved, bringing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> blades 13</span> successively into engagement with the corn,whereby the same is gradually reduced in bulk, the blades shaving ofi successive layers thereof.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  . By maintaining a continuous pressure of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> cylindrical body 10</span> upon the corn and by rapidly revolving the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> spindle 9</span> the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> blades 13</span> will rapidly remove the entire projecting portion of the corn.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   I&#39; do not limit myself to the exact constructionand arrangement of parts herein specified, but reserve the right to Vary the same within the scope of my invention and the claims appended hereto. 4   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having fully described my invention, I claim as new and desire to secure by Letters Patent- 1. A cutter for removing corns from the human foot provided with a revoluble toothed element, comprising a body portion and a peripheral metal strip secured thereto and pro- ,vided with a plurality of integral teeth, said metal strip being provided at one end with an opening, and at the other with a projection which is passed therethrough and whereby said strip is secured to said body portion, substantially asshown and described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2. A cutter of the class described, for removing corns from the human foot, comprising a base or bottom provided with a projecting support, a spindle journaled in said sup port and provided with atoothed element comprising a body portion, anda peripheral metal strip secured thereto and provided. with a plurality of integral teeth, said metal strip beiug provided at one end with an opening and at the other end with a projection which is passed therethrough, and whereby said strip is secured to the body portion, said spindle being provided with an end piece by means of which it may be manipulated, substantially as shown and described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In testimony that I claim the foregoingas my invention I have signed my name, in presence of the subscribing witnesses, this 11th day of January, 1900.   </p>
