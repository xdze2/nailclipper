                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A cutter device particularly useful for cutting fingernails and toenails includes a housing grippable by a user for holding and manipulating the device. A slot is formed in a conical end portion of the housing and is elongated in the circumferential direction for receiving a nail to be cut. A rotatable head having an outer conical surface is rotatably mounted within the conical end portion of the housing. A blade is fixed to the rotatable head and has a cutting edge extending substantially radially of the conical surface of the head and perpendicularly to the slot. A motor within the housing and coupled to the head rotates the head, and the blade fixed thereto, such that the cutting edge of the blade is rotated substantially perpendicularly to the direction of elongation of the slot and the nail received therein. </p>

                        <p>      The present application is a continuation-in-part application of prior application Ser. No. 07/614,468, filed Nov. 16, 1990, which application is still pending.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates to a cutter device, and particularly to a cutter device useful for cutting fingernails or toenails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      At the present time, fingernails and toenails are usually cut by scissors, clippers, or a simple knife. However, such manually-operated implements are awkward or time-consuming to use, do not cut uniformly, may be difficult and/or even useless with respect to very thick nails, and/or may accidentally cut surrounding skin.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A number of motor-operated filing devices have been proposed, as illustrated for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,896,684, 4,753,253, 4,213,471, 3,255,766 and 2,056,379, and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> Britis<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem191">h Paten<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem396">t Application 2,191,396</span></span></span>, but such devices trim or file the nail by abrasion, rather than by cutting, and therefore are relatively time-consuming to use particularly when substantial portions of the nail are to be cut away. U.S. Pat. No. 2,532,370 and Netherlands Patent 8005818 disclose motor-operated fingernail cutters, but such devices have not attained commercial use insofar as I am aware.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      OBJECTS AND BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      An object of the present invention is to provide a novel motor-operated cutter device particularly useful for cutting fingernails or toenails in a quick, efficient, safe and convenient manner.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      According to the present invention, there is provided a cutter device particularly useful for cutting fingernails and toenails, comprising: a housing grippable by a user for holding and manipulating the device, and having a conical end portion; a slot formed in the conical end portion of the housing an elongated in the circumferential direction thereof for receiving a nail to be cut; a rotatable head having an outer conical surface rotatably mounted within, the conical end portion of the housing; a blade fixed to the rotatable head and having a cutting edge extending substantially radially of the conical surface of the head and perpendicularly to the slot; and a motor within the housing and coupled to the head to rotate the head, and the blade fixed thereto, such that the cutting edge of the blade is rotated substantially perpendicularly to the direction of elongation of the slot and the nail received therein.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Two embodiments of the invention are described below for purposes of example.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      According to one described embodiment, the outer conical surface of the head is formed with a radially-extending recess bordered on one side by a seat, and the blade includes a single cutting edge. The blade is fixed to the head so as to overlie the one side of the recess, with the cutting edge of the blade spaced from, and substantially parallel to, the other side of the recess.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      According to a second described embodiment, the blade is also of conical configuration conforming to the outer conical surface of the head; and the blade is formed with a plurality of radial slots extending completely through the blade, starting from its outer periphery to an unslotted region centrally thereof, defining a plurality of cutting edges extending substantially radially of the conical surface of the blade and perpendicularly to the slots.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It has been found that a cutter device constructed in accordance with the foregoing features can be used for cutting fingernails and toenails in a quick, efficient, uniform and safe manner.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Further features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description below.  </p>

                        <p>      DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The Embodiment of FIGS. 1-7  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The cutter device illustrated in FIGS. 1-7 of the drawings comprises a housing,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> generally designated 2</span>, constituted of two half-sections 2a, 2b and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> removable end section or cover 3</span>. The half-sections 2a, 2b are secured together by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> threaded fastener 4</span> (FIG. 1), and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> cover 3</span> is removably received over one end of the housing. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> removable cover 3</span> is formed with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> slot 6</span> at one end for receiving the nail to be cut by a cutting blade within the housing. The remainder of the housing is shaped so as to be conveniently grippable by the user for manipulating the device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> removable cover 3</span> encloses a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> rotatably-mounted cutter head 8</span> carrying a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> blade 10</span> having a cutting edge 10a adapted to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> move under slot 6</span> so as to cut the nail inserted into the slot. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> cutter head 8</span> is coupled by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> shaft 11</span> to an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> electric motor 12</span> disposed within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> housing 2</span> and supplied by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> electrical batteries 14</span> also disposed within the housing.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> Shaft 11</span> is supported by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> bearing 16</span> carried by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> partition 18</span> integrally formed in the two housing sections 2a, 2b, and is coupled to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> motor 12</span> by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> coupling member 20</span>, e.g., a gear.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> cutter head 8</span> is of a solid, preferably metal, construction. It is formed with a bore for receiving the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> motor drive shaft 11</span>, and to which it is secured by an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> end fastener nut 21</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Cutter head 8</span> includes a frusto-conical section 8a and a cylindrical skirt section 8b, and is formed with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> recess or cavity 22</span> extending substantially radially through both sections 8a, 8b. The cutter head is further formed with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> seat 24</span> on which the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> blade 10</span> is secured by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> threaded fastener 26</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As shown particularly in FIG. 5,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> blade 11</span> is slightly longer, in the direction of rotation of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> cutter head 8</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> than seat 24</span>, so that the cutting edge 10a of the blade extends past edge 22a of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> recess 22</span>, but terminates slightly short of and parallel to its other edge 22b. As further shown in FIG. 5,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> seat 24</span> is formed obliquely to the rotary axis of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> cutter head 8</span>, defined by the longitudinal axis of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> shaft 10</span>, such that the cutting edge 10a of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> blade 10</span> projects slightly outwardly, by the distance indicated as &#34;L&#34; in FIG. 5, from the outer surface of the frusto-conical section 8a of the cutter head. This distance &#34;L&#34; fixes the thickness of the cuttings.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> removable cover 3</span> enclosing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> cutter head 8</span> includes a similar frusto-conical section 3a and cylindrical skirt 3b.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> Slot 6</span> for receiving the nail to be cut is formed in the frusto-conical section 3a in the circumferential direction. The cylindrical skirt 3b is removably received on a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> cylindrical end section 30</span> of the two housing halves 2a, 2b. In order to angularly locate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> removable housing section 3</span>, and particularly its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> slot 6</span>, with respect to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> cutter head 8</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> housing end section 30</span> is formed with an axially-extending rib 30a adapted to be received within a recess (shown as a slot) 3c formed axially in the cylindrical skirt 3b.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As shown in FIGS. 4 and 7,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> cutter head 8</span> is rotatably mounted eccentrically with respect to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> removable cover 3</span>, i.e., closer to the side of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> cover 3</span> formed with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> slot 6</span>. Thus, there is more space between the cutter head and the opposite side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> removable housing section 3</span>. This space enables the nail cuttings, after being cut during the rotation of the cutter head, to be directed by centrifugal action to, and to accumulate within, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> compartment 32</span> defined by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> partition 18</span>. This compartment may be emptied of the cuttings by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> merely removing cover 3</span> and pouring out the accumulated cuttings through the thus- opened end of the housing.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The illustrated cutter device further includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> manually-operated electrical switch 34</span>, and an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> electrical plug 36</span> including a pair of prongs 36a, 36b, extensible by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> slide 38</span> to the broken-line portion shown by prong 36b&#39; in FIG. 4, in order to insert the plug into a socket for recharging the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> batteries 14</span>, when rechargeable batteries are used.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The cutter device illustrated in FIGS. 1-7 is used in the following manner:  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Whenever a fingernail or toenail is to be cut,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> electric motor 12</span> is energized by operation of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> switch 34</span> to rotate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> cutter head 8</span>. The nail to be cut is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> inserted into slot 6</span> as shown particularly in FIG. 7.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It will be seen that the cutting edge 10a extends substantially perpendicularly to the direction of elongation of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> slot 6</span>, and thereby to the nail to be cut, and that<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> cutting head 8</span> is rotated to drive the cutting edge 10a (in the direction shown by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> arrow 40</span> in FIG. 5) substantially parallel to the direction of the slot. Thus, the nail inserted into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> slot 6</span> is cut neatly, quickly and safely by the cutting edge 10a of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> blade 10</span>, without any significant component of force applied outwardly with respect to the nail tending to break it.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The cuttings are automatically directed by centrifugal action, produced by the rotation of the head, away from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> slot 6</span> and into the space between the cutting head and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> cover 3</span> opposite to the slot, and fall by gravity to the bottom of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> compartment 32</span>. Whenever desired,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> compartment 32</span> may be emptied of the cuttings by merely removing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> cover 3</span> and inverting the housing to pour out the cuttings from the thus-opened end of the housing.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It will thus be seen that the illustrated cutter device is convenient, quick and safe to use since only the fingernail projecting through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> slot 6</span> is engageable by the cutting edge of the cutter head, and accumulates all the cuttings within it for easy removal whenever desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The Embodiment of FIGS. 8-12  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The cutter device illustrated in FIGS. 8-12 of the drawings comprises a housing,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> generally designated 102</span>, including a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104"> main section 104</span>, and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> removable cover 106</span> at one end. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> removable cover 106</span> is of generally conical configuration. The main section 104a is of generally cylindrical configuration to facilitate manually gripping and manipulating the device, but its end portion 104b, receiving the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> removable cover 106</span>, is of frusto-conical configuration to provide a smooth juncture with the cover.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As shown particularly in FIG. 12, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> removable cutter 106</span> is formed with a slot 106a elongated in the circumferential direction for receiving a nail to be cut by a cutting blade within the housing. Thus, as shown particularly in FIGS. 9 and 10, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> cover 106</span> encloses a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> cutter head 108</span> to which the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> cutter blade 110</span> is fixed. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> cutter head 108</span> is coupled to an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> electric motor 112</span> disposed within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> housing 102</span> and supplied by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> electrical batteries 114</span> also disposed within the housing.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> cutter head 108</span> is of a solid, preferably metal, construction. It includes an outer conical (or frusto-conical) surface 108a substantially conforming to the inner conical surface of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> cover 106</span>. A flat surface 108b is formed centrally of conical surface 108a and includes a central cylindrical projection 108c for use in securing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> cutter blade 110</span> to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> head 108</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> cutter head 108</span> is further formed with a cylindrical skirt section 108d and a stem 108e depending from the latter section, i.e., on the side of the cutter head opposite to that receiving the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> cutter blade 110</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> cutter blade 110</span> is formed with a conical (or frusto-conical) section 110a conforming to the conical surface 108a of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> cutter head 108</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> Blade 110</span> is further formed with a flattened surface 110b engageable with flat surface 108b of the cutter head, and with a central opening 110c for receiving projection 108c of the cutter head. Opening 110c of the blade is of non-circular (e.g., square) configuration. Thus,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> blade 110</span> is fixedly secured to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> head 108</span> by passing projection 108c through opening 110c and then splaying the projection, e.g., by an impact implement, to spread or turn out the projection and to fill the opening 110c.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Conical section 110a of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> cutter blade 11</span> is punched out with a plurality of radially-extending slots 110d around the circumference of the blade. The radial slots 110d extend completely through the thickness of the blade, starting from its outer periphery to the flattened central region 110b, which is not slotted. The radial slots thus form a plurality of spaced radially-extending cutting edges 110e extending from the unslotted central region to the outer periphery of the blade. It will thus be seen that the cutting edges 110e of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> cutting blade 110</span> also extend substantially radially of the conical surface 108a of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> head 108</span> and perpendicularly to the slot 106a formed in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> cover 106</span> receiving the fingernail to be cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> cutter head 108</span> is coupled to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> electric motor 112</span> by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120"> flexible tubular coupling 120</span> (FIG. 8) receiving the cutter head stem 108e at one end, and the shaft 112a of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> electric motor 112</span> at the opposite end. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120"> flexible tubular coupling 120</span>, e.g., of rubber, passes through a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122"> plastic bushing 122</span> mounted within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> housing 102</span> between<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> motor 112</span> an the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> cutter head 108</span>. Bushing 122a is formed with a passageway 122a for receiving the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120"> flexible tubular coupling 120</span>. Passageway 122a terminates at one end in an opening 122b of smaller diameter than the passageway for receiving the stem 108e of the cutter head. The opposite end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120"> bushing 120</span> is formed with a disc section 122c closing the respective end of the housing so as to define a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124"> compartment 124</span> with the housing for receiving the nail cuttings.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> housing 102</span> closed by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> cover 106</span> is formed with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> circumferentially-extending rib 130</span> and with a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem132"> axially-extending slots 132</span> on diametrically-opposite sides of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> rib 130</span>, to define, with the rib, a bayonet-type slot for receiving a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem134"> bayonet-type projections 134</span> formed in the end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> cover 106</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> cover 106</span> may be easily attached to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> housing 102</span> by merely passing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem134"> projections 134</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> cover 106</span> through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem132"> slots 132</span> in the housing, and rotating the cover; and may be as easily removed by reversing this sequence of steps.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Housing 102</span> carries an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140"> electrical switch 140</span> which may be operated to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> energize motor 112</span> and thereby to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> rotate head 108</span>, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> blade 110</span> carried thereby.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The cutter device illustrated in FIGS. 8-12 is used in the following manner:  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Whenever a fingernail or toenail is to be cut,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> electric motor 12</span> is energized by operation of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140"> switch 140</span> to rotate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> cutter head 108</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> cutter blade 110</span>. The nail to be cut is inserted into slot 106a. As<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> head 108</span> rotates, the cutting edges 110e of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> cutting blade 110</span> move substantially perpendicularly to the direction of elongation of the slot 106a in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> cover 106</span>, and to the nail received in the slot. Accordingly, the cutting edges 110e will neatly cut the nail received in the slot. The cu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124">ttings will accumulate within compartment 124</span> defined by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> housing 102</span> and the disc section 122c of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122"> bushing 122</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Emptying the housing of t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124">he cutting accumulated within compartment 124</span> may be easily done by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> merely rotating cover 106</span> to align its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem134"> projections 134</span> with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem132"> slots 132</span>, and then removing the cover from the housing.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In the arrangement illustrated in FIG. 12, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180"> cover may be rotated 180</span>Â° to selectively position the slot on one side of the housing for use by right-hand persons, or on the opposite side for use by left-hand persons.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      While the invention has been described with respect to two preferred embodiments, it will be appreciated that many other variations, modifications and applications of the invention may be made. </p>
