                        <p>  SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent N0. 782,654, dated February 14, 1905.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Application leC September 19, 1904. Serial No. 225,069.-   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom, it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Bev it known that I, HUBERT C. HART, acitizen of the United States, residing at Unionville, in the county of Hartford and State of Connecticut, have invented new and useful Improvements in Nail-Clippers, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention relates to improvements in finger-nail clippers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The object of the invention is to provide a nail-clipper having concealed means for locking the clipper-jaws to prevent the opening of the latter when not in use in a persons pocket. A   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Many other objects and advantages will be hereinafter referred to, and pointed out particularly in the claims.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the drawings, Figure 1 is a perspective view of my improved nail-clipper. Fig. 2 is a transverse section on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> line 22</span>, Fig. 4. Fig. 3 is a vertical section showing the clippers open. Fig. 4 is a similar view showing the clippers closed. Fig. 5 is a detail perspective View of one of the clipper members. Fig. 6 is a similar view showing the complementary member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The numeral 1 represents a clipper member l provided with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> opening 2</span> near its front end.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The end neXt the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> opening 2</span> is bent and sharpened to form a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> curved cutting edge 3</span>, and the side walls of the opening connecting the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> edge 3</span> are perfo-rated to receive a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> pintle 1</span>. At the opposite end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> member 1</span> is pivotally mounted by a rivet or the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> like 5</span> a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> linger-nail cleaner 6</span>,which also forms a locking element. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> cleaner 6</span> has&#39;a depression at 7&#39;, in which is seated the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> pivot 5</span>, and at the inner end the cleaner is pointed, as at 8, while its opposite end projects beyond the rivet andoutside the end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> member 1</span> to form a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> finger-piece 10</span>. A second clipper member is indicated at 11, and it comprises a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> handle 12</span>, provided with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> opening 13</span>, and at its front end the metal is bent and sharpened to form a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> curved cutting edge 14</span>, corresponding in size and shape with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> the/edge 3</span>. The side arms of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> clipper member 11</span> are perforated to receive the pintle 4f, said side arms fitting in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> opening 2</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> clipper member 1</span>. In rear of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> opening 13</span> a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> lug 15</span> is struck from the body of the metal and is in such position that when the two members are closed the pointed end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> cleaner 6</span> will engage it and prevent the members being opened. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring 16</span> is coiled around the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> pintle 4</span>, one end, 17, engaging the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> member 1</span> and the opposite end, 18, engaging the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> complementary member 11</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The parts assembled as set forth, the spring will normally hold the two clipper members apart, and upon squeezing them the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">g edges 3 and 14</span></span> are brought together and readily sever the finger-nail. If it be desired to lock the two clipper members together, they are closed and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> cleaner 6</span> is turned on its pivot to bring the point into engagement with the lug and prevents the members being opened. To release the members, that the dep vice may be operated, the finger end of the cleaner is turned and the pointed end engaged from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> lug 15</span> and the spring throws the members open.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The finger-nail cleaner may have a series of serrations 2O to form a file for the finger-nails When desired.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  What I claim as new is 1. A. iinger-nail clipper comprising a pair of spring-actuated clipping members pivoted together, a lever vpivoted on the inner side of one of the clipper members, and a lug struck from the complementary member and projecting on the inner side thereof, the pivoted lever engaging the lug to lock the two members together, substantially as described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  2. A nger-nail clipper comprising a pair of spring-actuated clipping members pivoted together, a pointed lever pivoted on the inside of one of the clipping members, a lug on the inside of the complementary clipper member,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  the pointed end of the lever engaging thelug to lock the clipper members together, substantially as described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   3. A finger-nail clipper comprising a pair of spring-actuated clipping members pivoted together, a lever pivoted on the inner side of one of the clipper members, and a flanged lug on the complementary member and projecting on the inner side thereof, the pivoted 1e- Ver engaging the flange of the lugto lock the IO two members together, substantially as described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In testimony whereof I aiix my signature in presence of two subscribing witnesses.   </p>
