                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> An improved nail polish remover bottle having a disposable nail polish remover applicator cap to remove the old nail polish is provided and consists of a body member designed as a dolphin. A cover cap to protect and seal the open end of the nail polish remover bottle and a nail polish remover applicator represent the snout which can be inserted to the body member. The dorsal fin represents a cuticle pusher with a sharp lined edge to push back the cuticles. The pectoral fins comprise a nail file to shape the nail edges and a buffer to smooth the nails. Two caudal fins, one featuring a finger nail cutter and the other a toe nail cutter can be optionally inserted to the tail of the dolphin. In conjunction with the invention a kit is arranged to accommodate all the above in addition to nail polish nail containers. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates to a new and improved cosmetic applicator bottle for nail care products. More particularly, this invention relates to a dolphin shaped nail polish remover bottle comprising a separable nail polish remover applicator cap, two buffers, a cuticle pusher, two nail files, a detachable finger nail cutter, and a detachable toe nail cutter. The necessity of having a Nail Polish Remover Bottle/Applicator with Manicure Devices and Kit is compounded by the fact that it is operated without the need to use separate devices when manicuring a nail. In using a nail polish remover product, a cotton ball is usually placed across the bottle mouth that must be slightly inverted to allow the cotton ball to absorb the polish remover liquid. The consumer must then balance the soaked cotton ball while closing the cap or may accidentally leave the bottle open, causing the solvent to evaporate with time. Usually application of the cotton ball to the open mouth of the bottle results in spillage. In addition, the transfer technique procedure is apparently burdensome and time consuming, thereby a need exists for an improved system in delivering nail polish remover to finger and toe nails that overcomes these disadvantages. Accordingly, this new invention satisfies a need for a mess-free application by allowing the dispensing and application of the nail polish remover onto the nail without the need to manually soak separate sponges or cotton swatches. Additionally, the present invention provides a dolphin shaped polish remover bottle which due to it&#39;s design can rest in the hand for one&#39;s convenient usage. The caring of nails is well known. Through the years the use of nail care products has continued to rise. This application, containing a uniquely combined nail care device having a detachable nail polish remover applicator cap is for the sake of convenience, and provides ease of use. Further, in accordance with the present invention there is provided a kit adapted for manicuring a nail. The kit also includes nail polish containers and two storage bags.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Turning now descriptively to the drawings, FIGS. 1 through 3 illustrate an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> improved nail polish remover bottle 18</span>. The essential components of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">dolphin shaped nail polish remover bottle 18</span> are a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> cover cap 27</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> removable sponge applicator cap 28</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> cuticle pusher 1</span> on the dorsal fin, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> buffer 2</span> and a nail file on each pectoral fin, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> finger nail cutter 13</span> on one caudal fin, and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> toe nail cutter 9</span> on another caudal fin. The individual components are described in detail in the following paragraphs.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> nail polish remover bottle 18</span> is preferably molded of materials that are durable and lightweight such as plastic resin or the like. With reference to FIG. 3, an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> elongated annular recess 11</span> inside of the wall of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> body member 18</span> is provided through which the contents are dispensed and is attached to the open end of the dolphin to provide means by which to securely insert the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> cover cap 27</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> sponge applicator cap 28</span> to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> bottle 18</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIGS. 5A, 5B, 5C, and 9 show the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> snout shaped sponge applicator cap 28</span> comprised of an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> elongated annular plastic ridge 29</span> extending away from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> main body 8</span> to snap-fit inside of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> annular recess 11</span> of the open end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> dolphin bottle 18</span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37"> small opening 37</span> fitted on the tip of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> ridge 29</span> is provided for controlling the amount of solvent delivered to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> applicator sponge 7</span> for better usage. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> application sponge 7</span> is adhesively affixed to the bottom of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> snout shaped body 8</span> and is dimensioned to fit within the confined form of it, for ease of use. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> sponge applicator 7</span> is made of an elastic porous absorbent material through which the solvent is directly dispersed. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> sponge applicator cap 28</span> features a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> retainer 30</span> means to hold the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> applicator sponge 7</span> securely in position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to FIGS. 4A and 4B, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> cover cap 27</span> is provided to seal and protect the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> bottle 18</span> during periods of non-use, which can also be snap-fit attached to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> bottle 18</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> cover cap 27</span> is rigid and snout-shaped attached to a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> plastic ridge 12</span> dimensioned to fit inside of the open end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> dolphin bottle 18</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> long narrow recess 11</span> within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> body member 18</span> can accommodate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> plastic ridge 12</span> that extend along the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> snout shaped cover cap 27</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> cover cap 27</span> is preferably constructed of a durable lightweight material which is similar to the rest as described above.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As can be seen in FIG. 6, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> cuticle pusher 1</span> is presented as the dorsal fin extending away from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> body member 18</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> cuticle pusher 1</span> is preferably constructed of a metal material or the like to gently push back the cuticles.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to FIGS. 7A and 7B, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> nail file 32</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> buffer 2</span> are mounted on each pectoral fin. In particular, the bottom part of each pectoral fin features a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> nail file 32</span> that attaches thereto. The top part of each pectoral fin is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> buffer 2</span> which is fixedly adhered to the flat surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> nail file 32</span> below. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> nail file 32</span> can enable the consumer to file and shape while the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> buffer 2</span> can provide nail smoothness to help keep the manicure looking better longer. In general, the pectoral fin may be shaped in any other configuration that would provide comfort as may be apparent to those of skill in the art.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      With reference to FIGS. 8A and 8B, there is shown a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> toe nail cutter 9</span> that sits on the end of one of the caudal fins. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> toe nail cutter 9</span> which is normally bigger than a finger nail cutter features a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> base piece 38</span>, an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> edge cutter 5</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> hinge 14</span>, and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> thumb lever 4</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> ridge 36</span> on the caudal fin is provided for inserting and attaching purposes.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to FIGS. 8C and 8D, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> finger nail cutter 13</span> which is mounted on the end of another caudal fin features a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39"> base piece 39</span>, an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> edge cutter 6</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> hinge 40</span>, and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> thumb lever 3</span>. Accordingly, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> ridge 36</span> does the same as described above. The nail cutters are preferably constructed of a hard metal or the like.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As can be observed in FIG. 8, there<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> is one other removable plain caudal fin 33</span> with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> ridge 36</span> which is molded from durable and lightweight plastic similar to the body member provided for decorating purposes when nail cutters are not in use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring again to FIG. 3, the three caudal fins are removably mountable to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> tail 10</span> of the dolphin. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> tail 10</span> is a wide hollow elongated chamber. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> tail 10</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> closed top 35</span> and an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> open bottom 34</span> ends allowing it to accommodate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> considerably wide elongated ridge 36</span> of the three caudal fins by inserting therein. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> closed top 35</span> end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> tail 10</span> serves to provide a stable base that allows the polish remover to stay within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> body member 18</span> and prevent spillage. As a result of this assembly the caudal fins can be attached to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> closed end 35</span> of the dolphin so that the detachment of the caudal fins are prevented by means of a perimetric edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> tail 10</span> and another perimetric edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> ridges 36</span> on the caudal fins. Other engagement means known to those skilled in the art is to attach the three caudal fin members so they may also be used, provided that a tight seal between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> tail 10</span> of the dolphin and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> ridges 36</span> on the caudal fins is formed. The caudal fins may then be easily removed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      With reference to FIG. 10,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> device 18</span> may be used in a kit adapted to provide a complete manicure for a nail. The kit has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> perimeter zipper 26</span> to provide means by which to bring the parts together and apart. The kit is preferably constructed of plastic material or the like which will include indentations and two small storage bags. There is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> dolphin shaped indentation 21</span> in the casing that allow for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> present device 18</span> to fit in and an additional three indentations for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> nail polish applicators 22</span>. The kit contains two different size bags, provided that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> bag 24</span> on the top part having a bigger space than the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> bag 20</span> on the bottom. The kit is also provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> one zipper 23</span> for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> top storage bag 24</span> and another<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> zipper 25</span> for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> bottom storage bag 20</span>, where the different designed cosmetic products and parts can be stored for transportation.  </p>
