                        <p>  BY<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> Mw? Un<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem93">ited St<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem147">ates Patent 3,093,147</span></span></span> NAIL CLIPPER William iE. Bassett, N. Race Brook Road, Woodbridge, Conn. Filed Oct. 19, 1960, Ser. No. 63,660 Claims. (Cl. 132-755) This invention relates to a nail clipper for trimming finger nails, toe nails and the like.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This type of clipper comprises a pair of oppositely disposed cutting jaw members which are secured together at one end and have inwardly directed cutting edges at the other end which are normally biased into spaced relation and are moved into cutting relation by the manipulation of a lever member mounted for pivotal and swinging movement on the jaw members.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   An object of the invention &#39;is to provide a nail clipper of said character provided with a nail tile and with means for maintaining the same in operative as Well as inoperative relation with reference to the jaw members. Nail clippers have been provided with nail files having prongs at the side edges thereof adapted to be engaged by the lever member for this purpose. However, such projections do not positively retain the le in longitudinal alignment with the jaw members since the projections permit of limited movement of hte tile about its pivotal connection with the jaw members. In order to overcome this objection, the present invention provides a construction which positively retains the file against sidewise movement in the inoperative position and in the operative or extended position in longitudinal alignment with the jaw members and which construction also retains the lever member against sidewise movement in the inoperative posi-tion thereof and necessitates the manual swinging of the lever member on its pivotal connection to free the file for movement to the operative or extended position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object of the invention is to provide a nail clipper in which the lever member is provided with means which may be conveniently engaged by a thumb or finger and retained in position thereon during the camming of the jaw member to effect the trimming operation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   With the foregoing and other objects in view, reference is now made to the following specification and accompanying drawings in which the preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In the drawings:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. l is an enlarged plan view of a nail clipper constructed in accordance with the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 2 is a longitudinal sectional view taken approximately on line 2-2 of FIG. l.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 3 is a view similar to FIG. 2 but showing the nail tile in operative position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 4 is a sectional view taken approximately on line 4-4 of FIG. l.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 5 is a sectional view taken approximately on line 5-5 of FIG. 3.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 6 is a side View of the nail clipper showing the parts in operative position for the cutting operation and with the nail file disposed in the inoperative position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring to the drawings, the nail clipper illustrated therein may be used for trimming `finger nails, toe nails and the like and includ<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">es oppo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">sitely disposed cutter jaw members 10 and 11</span></span> which are secured together in any desired manner in superimposed relation at one end and which diverge therefrom in normally spaced relation to the remote end thereof. The normally spaced ends of the jaw members are curved inwardly as at 12 and 13 and are formed with concave knife edges yla and 15 adapted `to engage throughout :their length to effect a cut- &#34;ice ting operation with the inward movement of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> jaw member 10</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The jaw members may be stamped from sheet metal as separate parts and secured together as described or the same may be formed integrally and bent and secured in said superimposed relation. The said members are of spring material and are biased by the tension thereof against inward movement. In order to effect relative inward movement thereof, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> levermember 16</span> is provided which is pivotally connected with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> post 17</span> pivotally mounted on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaw member 11</span> adjacent the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> curved end 13</span> thereof. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> post 17</span> extends freely through an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> opening 18</span> in the jaw member 1t) with the protruding end thereof pivotally engaged by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> lever member 16</span>. This member is formed with a curved and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> bifurcated end 19</span> and with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> cross bar 20</span> connected between the furcations thereof. The cross bar 2t) extends through a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> recess 21</span> in one side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> post 17</span>&#39; so as to pivotally connect the lever member thereto for swinging movement of the lever member from the inoperative position shown in FIGS. l, 2 and 3 to the operative position shown in FIG. 6 with the post rotated to dispose the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> recess 21</span> rearwardly.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It will be understood that when in the operative position shown in FIG. 6 of the drawings, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> curved end 19</span> of the lever member is disposed against the jaw member x10 with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> cross bar 20</span> positioned against the outer end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> recess 21</span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> projection 22</span> formed on the lever member adjacent the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> curved end 19</span> is disposed in engagement with the jaw member 10I as a fulcrum with the lever member arranged in angular relation with reference to said jaw member whereby swinging of the lever member toward the jaw member &#39;10 will effect inward movement of the said jaw member and cutting action of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> knife <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">edges 14 and 15</span></span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> nail tile 24</span> having le faces on each side is provided which is pivotally mounted in superimposed relation on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> jaw member 10</span> by means of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> rivet or eyelet 26</span> extending through aligned openings in the outer ends of the nail Ifile and jaw members with the ends of the eyelet flanged over for securing the :tile on the jaw member. By this arrange-ment the le is adapted to be disposed in the inoperative position between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> lever 16</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> jaw member 10</span> as shown inVFIGS. 1, 2 and 4 of the drawings and to be swung about the eyelet as a pivot to the extended or operative position shown in FIG. 3 of the drawings.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In order to positively retain the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> le 24</span> in both the operative and inoperative positions against sidewise movement thereof,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> openings 27</span>&#39; and 28 are provided in the iile which are disposed in equally spaced relation on opposite sides of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> eyelet 26</span>. The jaw member 10E is also provided with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> opening 29</span> which registers with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> opening 27</span> when the le is in the inoperative position and which registers with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> opening 28</span> when the tile is in the operative position. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> projection 30</span> -on the free end of the lever f16 extending in right angular relation to the plane thereof is adapted to snugly it the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> openin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">gs 27 and 28</span></span>&#39; in the tile and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> opening 29</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> jaw member 10</span>. When the le is disposed in the inoperative position, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem416"> lever member 416</span> is biased by the outward tension of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> jaw member 10</span> to maintain the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> projection 30</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> openin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">gs 27 and 29</span></span> and when the le is disposed in the operative position, the tension maintains the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> projection 30</span> in the openings 2S and 29, thus precluding any sidewise movement of the file when the same is disposed in the operative position for use for tiling or trimming nails and when in the inoperative position between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> jaw member 10</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> lever member 16</span>. It will be understood that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> projection 30</span> is long enough to extend through 4both the registering 4openings in the le and jaw member 1G whereby the lever member is positively retained in the inoperative position shown in section in FIG. 2. This prevents relative sidewise movement of the lever member when the nail clipper is not in use. In order to free the lever member, the same must be raised to disengage the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> projection 30</span> from the aligned openings. The projection 30v also provides means by which the thumb or inger may be engaged against the outer end of the lever member so as to prevent slipping therefrom when camming the lever member downwardly for effecting a cutting operation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In practice both the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> openin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">gs 27 and 28</span></span> and the opening for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> rivet or eyelet 26</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> le 24</span> are made by a single tool. Accordingly, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> openings 27</span> and 2S are connected with the opening for the rivet or eyelet by narrow slots but these slots are closed with the insertion of the rivet or eyelet. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> opening 29</span> and the opening for the rivet or eyelet in the jaw member are made also by a single tool whereby these openings are connected by a narrow slot which is closed with the insertion of the rivet or eyelet. These slots serve no function other than facilitating the manufacture of the nail clipper.   </p>

                        <p>   1. In a nail clipper, oppositely disposed longitudinally extending members connected together at one end and having mating cutting jaws at the opposite end which are biased into normally spaced relation, a lever mounted on said longitudinally extending members for swinging movement toward said members and having means for forcing the jaw ends of said members together for effecting a cutting operation and said lever having an inoperative position in superposed relation with one of said longitudinally extending members, a iile member, means pivotally connecting said tile member on said one longitudinally extending member for movement from longitudinal superposed relation therewith to outwardly extended relation at one end of said one longitudinally extending member, said tile member having openings spaced longitudinally thereof and disposed on opposite sides of the pivotal connection of said le member with said one longitudinally extending member, said one longitudinally extending member having an opening disposed in alignment with one of the openings in said le member when said file is in said longitudinal relation and said opening in said one longitudinally extending member being disposed in alignment with the other opening in the iile member when the iile member is in sa-id extended relation, and said lever having an extension of a length and size and positioned so as to project into said one opening in said ijle member and into said opening in said longitudinally extending member when said openings are aligned with the le member disposed in said longitudinal superposed relation, and said extension being adapted to project into said other opening in said fiile member and into said opening in said longitudinally extending member when said openings are aligned with the file member disposed in said extended relation for retaining said iile member in said relations respectively against sidewise movement about its pivotal connection.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2. In a nail clipper as set forth in claim 1 in which said projection corresponds substantially in cross-sectional configuration to that of the openings in said tile member and the opening in said longitudinally extending member and snugly fits said openings wherein said file member is re- 4- tained against sidewise movement when in longitudinal relation with said one longitudinally extending member and when in outwardly extending relation therewith and said lever is retained against sidewise movement when in said inoperative position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   3. In a nail clipper as set forth in claim 1 in which the oppositely disposed longitudinally extending members consist of a single length of material arranged in doubled over relation medially of the length thereof and with the doubled over end disposed in superimposed relation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   4. In a nail clipper, oppositely disposed longitudinally extending members connected together at one end and having mating cutting jaws at the opposite end which are biased into normally spaced relation, a lever mounted on said longitudinally extending members for swinging movement toward said members and having means for forcing the jaw ends of said members together for etecting a cutting operation and said lever having an inoperative position in superposed relation with one of said longitudinally extending members, a le member, means pivotally connecting said tile member on said one longitudinally extending member for movement from longitudinally superposed relation therewith to outwardly extended relation at one end of said one longitudinally extending member, said tile member having an opening therethrough located adjacent the pivotal connection of said tile member with said one longitudinally extending member, said one longitudinally extending member having an opening therethrough located adjacent said pivotal connection of the le member therewith and which is disposed in registry with the opening in the le member when said file member is in said extended relation, and said lever having an extension of a length and size to project into said openings when said openings are in registry with the tile member disposed in said extended relation for retaining said tile member against sidewise movement about its pivotal connection.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   5. In a nail clipper, oppositely disposed longitudinally extending members connected together at one end and having mating cutting jaws at the opposite end which have means normally biasing them to spaced relation, a lever pivotally mounted on said longitudinally extending members for swinging movement toward said members and having means for forcing the jaw ends of said members together for effecting a cutting operation and said y,lever having an inoperative position in superimposed relation with one of said longitudinally extending members, said one longitudinally extending member having an opening therein at the end thereof remote from the cutting jaw thereof, and said lever having an extension projecting outwardly in angular relation at the outer end of said lever and of a length and size to project into said opening when said lever is in said inoperative position for retaining said lever against side-wise movement, said lever having means to cause said biasing means to urge said extension into said opening, and said projection extending outwardly Iwhen said lever is in said operative position for engagement by a finger or the thumb of the user for facilitating Imovement of said lever member for effecting a cutting operation.   </p>
