                        <p>  To all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, JonN Pn&#39;urinoNn, a citizen of the United States, residing at Ansonia, county of New Haven, State of Conuecticut, have invented an Innn&#39;ovement in Nail-Clippers, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention relates to nail clippers and has for its object to provide a device of this character which will be of a simple and compact construction, involving a minimum munber of parts, and which will be convenient and etlicient in use. These and other objects of the irwention, together with means whereby the same may be carried into e tfeet, will best be understood from the following description of one fornror embodiment thereof illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure l. a longitudinal. section. Fig. 2 is a plan view. Fig. 3 is a detail. section taken sul&#39;istantially on the line i:l--3 Fig. l.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The improved nail clipper comprises a pair of arms including an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> arm 10</span>, which is preferably formed of suitable material, such as spring steel, so as to be more or less resilient, and an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> arm 11</span> also formed of the same or similar material but preferably of such a shape as to be substantially rigid.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  At one end of the device the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> arms 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">0 and 11</span></span> are provided w<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ith coo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">perating inturned cut ting members 12 and 13</span></span> respectively. At the opposite end. the arm ll is formed with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> integral inturned lip 27</span> Which enters an opening formed in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> arm 10</span> adjacent the end thereof and is riveted therein, thereby connecting said arms. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> arms 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">0 and 11</span></span> are further secured together by means of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> rivet 14</span>. As shown, the cutting member .12 is provided with a sharp cutting edge, while the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> member 13</span> has a flat or slightly inwardly beveled face the outer edge of which cooperates with the cutting edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> member 12</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The arm ll is preferably formed with lateral flanges or turned edge portions and lt&#39;, the latter lying adjacent the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> lip 27</span> and engaging the inner face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> arm 10</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> arm 11</span> further formed with a depressed portion forming a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> longitudinal groove or corrugation 17</span> terminating in an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> opening 18</span> at the edge of which,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> adjacent said groove 17</span>, an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> integral lip 19</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">   </p>
                    
                        <p>  flanges or turned edges 1</span>.? serve the purpose of housing the pivot for the ope &#39;ating lever, hereafter described, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> groove 17</span> provides a clearance to facilitate the operation of said lever, while the flange &#39;16 serves to provide a firm bearing between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> arms 10</span> and 1t and to separate these arms a sullieient dis tance to provide a suitable space for the pivot of the operating lever. The flanges and 16 and corrugatimi &#39;17 further contribute to the longitudinal rigidity of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> arm 11</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   20 denotes a lug riveted to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> arm 10</span> and to which is pivoted, as at 21, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> operating lever 22</span> extending through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> opening 18</span> in the arm ll. Said lever is substantially U-shaped in cross section, as shown in Fig. 3, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> opposite parallel sides 23</span> thereof being pivoted to said lug 2t) and engaging at their edges the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> lip 15</span>).<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> Said lever 22</span> is formed on its upper surface with a nail lile Q-l: and at its outer end with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> cleaning point 25</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   26 denotes a catch pivoted on the rivet it to the arm l1 and adapted to engage the free end or point of said<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> lever 22</span> to lock the same, as shown in Fig. 9.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The operation of the device will. it is thought, be obvious without further explanation. It will. be observed, however, that the construction of.the device is extremely simple, light. and compact while the clipper as a whole involves in its construction a very small number of parts in comparison with similar devices of equal e&#39;tliciency and convenience of operation as heretofore constructed.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having thus described my invention, I claim:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A nail clipper comprising a rigid arm having a stud and a resilient arm rigidly secured to the rigid arm. said resilient arm having an opening therethrough, a longitudinal groove and at the forward end of said groove and contiguous to the opening a lip, and an operating lever U-shaped in cross section whose edges engage the lip, substantially as described, for the purpose set forth.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In testimony whereof I atlix my signature in presence of two witnesses.   </p>
