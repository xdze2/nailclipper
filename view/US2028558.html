                        <p>  DOUBLE LEVER SIDE CUTTING IMPLEMENT Filed Feb. 26V,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> 1955 f @uw la 5</span> yATTORNEY Patented Jan. 21, 1936 UNITED STATES AT1-:NT AOFFICE DOUBLE LEVER SIDE CUTTING IMPLEMENT John A. Nietzel, Elizabeth, and Richard Toeplitz, Irvington, N. J.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention relates to a side cutting implement of the double lever box type and especially to an instrument for cutting cuticle and nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As far as we are aware, up to the present time cuticle and nail nippers, and surgical cutting implements have been made from drop forgings requiring several finishing operations such as trimming, milling, drilling, plating and polishing. We have found that the principal weakness of such implements is in the loosening of the fulcrum screw which permits the cutting edges to move out of alignment.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is the object of our invention to provide a side cutting implement of the double lever box joint type made from suitable sheet metal, thereby reducing greatly the cost of manufacture and at the same time eliminating the weakness reierred to, which is inherent in the ordinary type of iulcrum screw joint.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Other and ancillary objects will be clear to one skilled in the art of manufacturing such implements, from a reading of the speciiication taken in connection with the annexed drawing, wherein:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure l is a plan View on a somewhat enlarged scale of our improved type of instrument.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 2 is a view on a somewhat enlarged scale of certain parts involved in the construction of the instrument, in disassembled position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Figure 3 is a section on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> line 3</span> 3 of Figure 1.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Figure 4 is a section on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> line 4</span> 4 of Figure 1.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 5 is a view looking at the cutting end of the implement with the cutting jaws in separated position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 6 is a perspective View of two of the reenforcing elements which are shown in Figure 2.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 7 is a View of the same parts of Figure 6, but placed together in assembled position without the pivot pin.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 8 is a side view of one of the cutting members.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the diierent views, wherein like numbers refer to corresponding parts, the implement is made up of two cutting members I and 2, each having<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> upturned sides 3</span> which have<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> reduced extensions 4</span>. The ends of the members I and 2 opposite the reduced extensions l are formed in a curvilinear manner, meeting in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> cutting edge 5</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> width 6</span> across the upturned sides ci the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> member 2</span> is such that the upturned sides of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> member 2</span> will iit snugly within the space &#39;I between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> upturned sides 3</span> of the member I.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   While it m-ay not be necessary to use reenforcing members in connection with the jaw members I and 2, we prefer to use reenforcing members such as are described hereinafter. Positioned within the upturned sides of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> member 2</span>, are the ends I0 of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> reenfo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">rcing members 8 and 9</span></span>, these ends I0 being flattened and trimmed to the approximate form shown in Figures 2, 6 and 7, so that when they are together as shown in Figure 7, they iill the space between the upturned sides of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> member 2</span>, as is clearly shown in Figure 3. The upturned sides of both the members I and 2 are provided with -a pivot hole il, and likewise the attened ends I@ of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> member<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">s 8 and 9</span></span> are provided with pivot holes I2, so that after these parts have been assembled, they are held in operative position by pivot pin I3 which is passed through the holes II and I2. The thick or heavy ends I4 of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> members 8</span> and lie respectively between the extensions I of the members I and 2 and project along with the extensions out to some point indio-ated by the dotted line I5 of Figure 1.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Lever or handle members I6 are formed so that their inner ends I&#39;l are U-shaped and t over both the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> extensions 4</span> and the ends I4 of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> reenfo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">rcing members 8 and 9</span></span>, and are securely fastened thereto as by spot-welding, so that the unitary structure appears about as shown in section in Figure 4.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Preferably, we make the parts I and 2, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> reenfo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">rcing members 8 and 9</span></span>, and the handles Iii from the same kind of material, whereby the entire implement after being -assembled may be hardened and tempered as a whole. To do this, we prefer to make the implement out of .80 carbon steel, although for some purposes the handle and reenforcing members m-ay be of cold rolled steel varying from .20 to .80 carbon, but we prefer not to go below .40. By making the handle of the implement of a higher carbon content, the handle or lever portion will be much stiffer and the implement more satisfactory.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In some cases we prefer to use a spring I8 pivotally mounted at I9 to one of the handle or lever members, with the other end positioned within the channel-shaped end of the other handle or lever adjacent the end of the reenforcing member in said lever. The use of the spring IB is to hold the cutter or nipper in open position and to open it after pressure is removed from the handle or lever part I6. When a case is used for the instrument, the spring I8 may be turned to i the dotted position, so that the implement can be closed and thus occupy a small space.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It will be noted from the section of Figure 3,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> thatthe upturned sides 3</span> of the jaw members I and 2 form a box type of joint, wherein a relatively large wearing area is obtained. By the use of this construction, wobble between the jaws is substantially eliminated and the cutting members will come together on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> true cutting edge 5</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   From what has been said, it will be seen that we have provided a side cutting double lever instrument which is light and cheap to manufacture, yet one which is highly efficient in operation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  What we claim is:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1. An implement of the class described including, a pair of punched and formed members, each having upturned sides with reduced extensions, the width across the said sides of one member being such that said one member will t snugly within the sides of the other member, the ends of said members opposite to said reduced extensions being formed in a curvilinear manner meeting in a cutting edge, reenforcing members having the corresponding ends thereof formed to snugly fill the space within the inner pair of said upturned sides and also having their opposite endslying between said reduced extensions, a pivot pin passing through said upturned and overlapping sides and the reenforcing members, and a lever or handle securely fastened to each of said extensions and ends of said reenforcing members which are positioned therebetween.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2. An implement of the class described including, a pair of cutting jaw Vmembers of suitable sheet metal and having thin central portions Y formed with upturned sides in substantially parallel relation, but one adapted to fit within the other in a box-like manner, the corresponding ends of each member being curvilinearly formed and meeting in a cutting edge, while the opposite spaced ends extend a distance beyond said central portions, reenforcing members positioned between each of said spaced ends and having portions extending only within the said box-like formation, a pivot pin going through all the parts of said box-like formation, and a punched and formed lever or handle securely fastened to said opposite ends of each jaw member and its associated reenforcing member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   3. A double lever side cutting implement. composed of a pair of punched and formed jaw members having cutting edges and overlapping parts to form a box-like joint, reenforcing members having parts in juxtaposition within the box joint and other portions located between spaced parts of each of said jaw members, a pivot pin going through and completing the box joint, and punched and formed levers securely fastened to the ends of said jaw members and the reenforcing member portions located therebetween and a spring pivotally mounted between said levers for the purpose described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   4.
