                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> The present invention provides attachable upper and lower handles for attachment by insertion into the opposite the cutting ends or the distal ends of a conventional nail clipper wherein the handles define an area sized for receiving thumbs, fingers, or hand or palm portions of an individual in a comfortable, natural manner to allow the nail clipper to be held more securely and conveniently during a nail clipping operation. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention may provide attachable upper and lower handles defining a roughened broader thumb contacting area to aid in minimizing or even eliminating slippage during use by enlarging the metal lever arm to a size allowing firm thumb pressure. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    This invention is directed to finger and toenail clippers. More specifically, the invention relates to an aid for making such clippers more comfortable, easier and accurate to use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    Manicure implements such as fingernail clippers, toenail clippers, tweezers and emery boards are extremely popular and widely used to improve one&#39;s hygiene and visual appearance. However, many individuals who have been using such manicure implements for many years find it increasingly difficult to manipulate these small devices, particularly as these individuals age or lose manual dexterity. In addition, many individuals suffer from arthritis or other forms of joint disease, which makes it extremely difficult to hold and use small implements. Although these individuals find it difficult to hold and employ these manicure devices, these individuals desire to use these devices and attempt to do so, with varying degrees of success. In view of this problem, the manicure implements have been constructed in a variety of alternate configurations in an attempt to improve the handling characteristics of these implements. However, either due to manufacturing difficulties or construction expenses, these prior art systems have been incapable of satisfying consumers&#39; desire to have manicure implements which are easily handled, regardless of impaired dexterity.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    One of the principal drawbacks encountered with prior art constructions is the inability to develop a usable product which is not too costly to produce. Typically, the prior art configurations that have been developed suffer from the inability to be competitively manufactured. Consequently, these implements cannot be sold at a reasonable price. Furthermore, many of these prior art constructions fail to enhance the operability of the manicure implements and, instead, merely create a more cumbersome, difficult-to-use product for toenails and/or fingernails. Such nail clippers are typically compact and designed to be carried in a pocket or purse where it is readily available for later use. Some nail clippers include additional nail care tools such as a file that can manicure or round-out rough or jagged nail edges. Other nail clippers may include a tip extending or projecting from one end or a side of the nail clippers for use in cleaning dirt or debris out from underneath the nail. Yet other nail clippers may further include a clip for connecting the nail clipper to an item such as a key ring or may include an integral pocket knife.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    Conventional nail clippers are usually made of a solid material such as metal or hard plastic. Such nail clippers typically include some form of a lever or handle that swings or pivots about a fulcrum and is used to activate a pair of cutting edges. The cutting edges themselves are almost always made out of a sharpened metal material and may be concave in shape to better fit the arc of the nail head. The cutting edges are disposed at one end of a pair of spring-biased arms or elongated bars secured together at a second, opposite end. The spring-biased arms/bars ensure that the cutting edges remain in an open position when the nail clipper is not being used. The cutting edges activate through pivotal depression of the lever about a fulcrum that extends through both spring-biased arms/bars and engages the underside of the lower arm/bar near the end having the cutting edges. The lever also rotationally couples to the fulcrum and may include some protrusion or ‚Äútoe‚Äù that presses against the top spring-biased arm to drive the cutting edges into contact with one another when depressed. That is, the user depresses the lever toward the surface of the spring-biased arm, forces the fulcrum upward such that engagement with the lower spring-biased arm causes each spring-biased arm to move toward one another thereby bringing the cutting edges together in a clipping relationship.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    The lever or handle may have a tendency to rotate left-to-right or right-to-left about the fulcrum during the cutting operation. This is particularly problematic because the lever or handle is generally elongated and fails to provide stability against such rotational movement. In turn, this may impede comfort, use of the nail clippers and the accuracy of cutting the nail. A single pivoting lateral lever may even require excessive and imprecise handle movement to perform the cutting operation. For example, the sharp edges of the nail clipper may inadvertently pinch, cut or nick the skin surrounding the fingernail or toenail of the person handling the nail clipper. This primarily occurs due to the misalignment of the nail clipper relative to the nail. Consequently, inadvertent movement of the lever or handle during the cutting operation may cause such misalignment.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    Poor lighting can also be particularly problematic as the user is unable to align the nail clippers in the proper position and depth to cut the nails without injury. Oftentimes, the nail clippers may extend too far up underneath the nail such that the user clips a portion of the skin where the nail contacts the nail bed. This can be particularly painful and may even cause bleeding. Additionally, the exposed cutting edges may damage clothing during transportation when placed in a pocket or purse. The cutting edges may also have a tendency to damage the interior of a drawer when placed therein for storage. Some prior art nail clippers include a selectively removable guard to protect the aforementioned items from damage. But, the guard itself may be easily lost or become dislodged from the nail clippers during transportation. When detached, the guard is an ineffective preventative measure against damage to surrounding objects or containers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    Therefore a need exists for a nail clipper that provides ergonomic and safe activation of the nail cutters while storing nail clippings. Such an improved nail clipper should include a compartment for storing one of a plurality of differently sized and/or shaped conventional nail clippers and should include an ergonomic pushbutton that activates the clipping mechanism and should be easy to manufacture and cost effective. The present invention fulfills these needs and provides further related advantages.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0008]    The present invention provides attachable upper and lower handles for attachment by insertion into the opposite the cutting ends or the distal ends of a conventional nail clipper wherein the handles define an area sized for receiving thumbs, fingers, or hand or palm portions of an individual in a comfortable, natural manner to allow the nail clipper to be held more securely and conveniently during a nail clipping operation. In one preferred embodiment, side cutting jaws are included to allow the nail clipper to be placed at a more natural and convenient angle with respect to a nail when the clipping operation is being carried out. In another preferred embodiment, the present invention may provide attachable upper and lower handles defining a roughened broader thumb contacting area to aid in minimizing or even eliminating slippage during use by enlarging the metal lever arm to a size allowing firm thumb pressure. The nail clipper assembly of the present invention makes nail clipping easier for old age people by providing increased control by saving time and minimizing ‚Äúcracked nails‚Äù.  </p>
