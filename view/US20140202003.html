                        <p>          [0002]    The present invention relates to a pair of nail clippers. More particularly, the present invention relates to the pair of nail clippers which are suitable for cutting the nails on the human fingers and toes gently and softly without causing any unnatural deformations to the nails when they are to be cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    When the term for the pair of nail clippers is referred to herein, it includes two types of nail clippers such as the clip-type pair of nail clippers and the nipper-type pair of nail clippers which may take the form of nail scissors.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    2. Description of the Prior Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    There are many different types of nail clippers that have been proposed heretofore, in which one typical example of such pairs of nail clippers comprises two cutting blades facing opposite each other, one of the two opposed cutting blades having a cutting edge formed on a tip of the one cutting blade and the other of the two opposed cutting blades having a cutting edge formed on a tip of the other cutting blade, and is designed so that the nails can be cut by bringing the two opposed cutting edges closer to each other and holding a particular nail being to be cut between the two opposed cutting edges thus brought closer to each other to cause the two opposed cutting edges to engage each other and cut that particular nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    As it will be described below, there are also other types of nail clippers that have been proposed heretofore, which take into account the shapes of the human nails and are specifically designed for cutting the nails gently and softly without causing any unnatural deformations to the nails when they are being to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> be cut<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> (Patent Documents 1 and 2</span></span>, for example).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]      FIG. 1  ( a ) and ( b ) and  FIG. 2  illustrate one typical example of the conventional pairs of nail clippers. Specifically,  FIG. 1  ( a ) and ( b ) represent the clip-type pair of nail clippers, and  FIG. 2  represents the nipper-type pair of nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    For the clip-type nail clippers, it is general that an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">upper plate  50</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">lower plate  51</span>  are joined together into one unit on the base end sides thereof (on the rear sides in  FIG. 1  ( a )), and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">cutting blade  52</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">cutting blade  53</span>  are formed on the respective tips of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">lower plates  50</span>  and  51  (on the front sides in  FIG. 1  ( a )) so that they can face opposite each other. The upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">lower plates  50</span>  and  51  are joined together by means of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">support pin  54</span>  that is inserted vertically into the respective tips of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">lower plates  50</span>  and  51 . On the upper end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">support pin  54</span>  thus inserted through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">upper plate  50</span> , the base end side of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">press-down operating plate  55</span>  (on the lower side in  FIG. 1  ( a )) is supported so that it can be turned pivotally.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    On the base end side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">press-down operating plate  55</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">lever-acting portion  56</span>  is provided. In the state in which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">lever-acting portion  56</span>  is directed downwardly to engage the upper surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">upper plate  50</span>  as shown in  FIG. 1  ( a ), the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">tip side  55</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">press-down operating plate  55</span>  (the upper side in  FIG. 1  ( a )) may be pressed downwardly so that it can be turned about the base end side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">press-down operating plate  55</span>  pivotally supported by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">support pin  54</span> . This will allow the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">lever-acting portion  56</span>  to press the upper side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">upper plate  50</span>  downwardly, causing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">cutting edge  57</span>  formed on the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">upper cutting blade  52</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">cutting edge  58</span>  formed on the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">lower cutting blade  53</span>  to be moved closer to each other as indicated by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">two opposed arrows  60</span>  and  61 . In this way, a particular nail being to be cut (not shown) will be held between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">upper cutting edge  57</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">lower cutting edge  58</span>  that faces opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">upper cutting edge  57</span>  so that that particular nail will be ready to be cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    For the nipper-type pair of nail clippers, it is general that two levers are provided in which one lever is shown by  71  and has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71">hinge portion  71</span>   a,  and the other lever is shown by  70  and has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">hinge portion  70</span>   a.  A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">shaft  72</span>  is rigidly fixed to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71">hinge portion  71</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71">one lever  71</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">hinge portion  70</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">other lever  70</span>  is pivotally mounted on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">shaft  72</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73">cutting blade  73</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">cutting blade  74</span>  are formed on the respective tip sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">levers  70</span>  and  71  so that they can face opposite each other. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73">cutting blade  73</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">cutting blade  74</span>  include respective cutting edges (not shown), which are formed on the corresponding tips thereof so that they can face opposite each other. Those cutting edges are curved at a particular curvature that permits the curved shape of the one cutting edge to exactly match the corresponding curved shape of the other cutting edge when they meet each other. In one typical example of the conventional cutting edges, the cutting edge formed on the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73">cutting blade  73</span>  is curved like the convex shape while the cutting edge formed on the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">cutting blade  74</span>  is curved like the concave shape.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    Gripping the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">levers  70</span>  and  71  with the fingers of one free hand (left or right) and then rotating them about the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">shaft  72</span>  as indicated by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75">two opposed arrows  75</span> ,  76  will cause the cutting edge formed on the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73">one cutting blade  73</span>  and the cutting edge formed on the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">other cutting blade  74</span>  to be brought closer to each other as indicated by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem77">two opposed arrows  77</span> ,  78 . In this way, a particular nail to be cut (not shown) will be held between the two cutting edges facing opposite each other and will be ready to be cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    It should be understood that the nails on the human fingers and toes that are to be cut present very different forms or shapes when they are viewed from the tip sides of the nails. For example, when a particular nail is viewed from the tip side of that particular nail, it is curved downwardly as it goes from the middle portion toward the left and right sides. Some nails may be flat on the middle portion and may be curved on the left and right sides. Other nails may be entirely flat on the middle portion and on the left and right sides when they are viewed from their tip sides.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]    The prior art pairs of nail clippers as proposed heretofore and presented as examples in  FIG. 1  ( a ), ( b ) and  FIG. 2  are designed to take into account the shapes and forms of the human nails such as the ones mentioned above. In one typical example of the conventional pairs of nail clippers as presented in  FIG. 1  ( a ), ( b ). it may be apparent that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">upper cutting edge  57</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">lower cutting edge  58</span>  facing opposite each other have the respective shapes and forms such that they are curved downwardly at the particular curvature that permits the curved shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">upper cutting edge  57</span>  to exactly match the corresponding curved shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">lower cutting edge  58</span>  when they meet each other as those cutting edges go farther away from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">respective middle portions  57</span>   a,    58   a  toward the respective left and right sizes. In another typical example of the conventional pairs of nail clippers as presented in  FIG. 2 , the cutting edges of the one and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73">other cutting blades  73</span> ,  73  facing opposite each other are curved at the particular curvature that permits the curved shape of the one cutting edge to exactly match the corresponding curved shape of the other cutting edge such that the one cutting edge has the convex shape while the other cutting edge has the concave shape. In this example, the conventional pair of nail clippers take into account the shapes or forms of the nails on the human fingers and toes, and are designed so that the nails can be cut gently and softy without causing any unnatural deformations to the nails when they are to be cut.  </p>

                        <p>          [0062]    The embodiment shown in  FIG. 6  ( a ) is now described, in which the one cutting edge portion on the left side is formed on a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem85">cutting blade  85</span>  having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90">cutting edge  90</span>  thereon while the other cutting edge portion on the right side is formed on a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">cutting blade  84</span>  having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem89">cutting edge  89</span>  thereon.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0063]    The embodiment in  FIG. 6  ( a ) has the construction that is substantially similar to that of the embodiment; in  FIG. 3  ( a ) described above, in that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem89">cutting edges  89</span>  and  90  in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem89">clude respective straight line portions  89</span>   a  and  90   a  facing opposite each other and extending parallel to each other in the direction perpendicular to the direction in which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem89">cutting edge  89</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90">cutting edge  90</span>  are moving so as to be brought closer to each other, and further include <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem89">respective curved portions  89</span>   b,    89   c  and  90   b,    90   c  that are provided contiguously to t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem89">he corresponding straight line portions  89</span>   a  and  90   a  and are curved and extended at a curvature that permits the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem89">curved portions  89</span>   a,    89   c  to exactly match the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90">corresponding curved portions  90</span>   b,    90   c  when they meet each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0064]    A single thin metal plate that is suitable for providing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">cutting blades  84</span>  and  85  which together make up the pair of nail clippers is provided. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">cutting blades  84</span>  and  85  may be provided by cutting the single thin metal plate along the center line thereof into the two separate parts by means of the press cutting process, for example. Previously, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">cutting blades  84</span>  and  85  may be provided with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem91">respective mounting holes  91</span>  and  92  through which they may be mounted to the their respective supporting members as described above.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0065]    More specifically, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">cutting<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem85"> blades  84</span>  ad  85</span>  that have thus been provided by cutting the single thin metal plate along the center line thereof into the two separate parts by the press machining process may be attached to or detached from the corresponding tips of one pair of cutting edge supporting members that may be brought closer to or farther away from each other, thereby permitting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem89">one cutting edge  89</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90">other cutting edge  90</span>  to be moved closer to each other as indicated by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">two opposed arrows  11</span> ,  12  and to hold a particular nail being cut between the one and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem89">other cutting edges  89</span>  and  90  and cut that particular nail actually by causing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem89">one cutting edge  89</span>  to engage the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90">other cutting edge  90</span> . The pair of nail clippers of the present invention may thus be constructed in the above manner.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0066]      FIG. 6  ( b ), ( c ) and  FIG. 7  are provided to illustrate one example of the nipper-type pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">nail clippers  80</span>  that include the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">cutting blades  84</span>  and  85  as they are mounted as described above.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0067]    The pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">nail clippers  80</span>  as illustrated in  FIG. 6  ( b ), ( c ) and  FIG. 7  have the construction that is substantially similar to that of the pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">nail clippers  31</span>  as illustrated in  FIG. 5  ( a ), ( b ), in that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">one lever  21</span>  has the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">hinge portion  21</span>   a  to which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">shaft  22</span>  is rigidly fixed and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">other lever  20</span>  has the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">hinge portion  20</span>   a  that is rotatably fixed to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">shaft  22</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0068]    For the pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">nail clippers  80</span> , the construction is such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">cutting blades  84</span>  and  85  may be mounted to the res<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem81">pective cutting blade mounting portions  81</span>  and  82  which are provided on the tip edges of the one and the other cutting edge portions facing opposite each other. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem81">cutting blade mounting portions  81</span>  and  82  are provided on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">corresponding hinges  22</span>   a  and  21   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">levers  20</span>  and  21 , and the tips of the pair of cutting edge supporting members are provided such that those tips can be brought closer to or farther away from each other, thereby permitting the one and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">other cutting edges  84</span>  and  90  to be moved closer to each other as indicated by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">two opposed arrows  11</span>  and  12  and to cut a particular nail being cut by holding that particular nail between the opposed cutting edges and causing the opposed cutting edges to engage each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0069]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem89">cutting edges  89</span>  and  90  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">cutting blades  84</span>  and  85  have the construction that is substantially similar to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">cutting edges  9</span>  and  10  included in the pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail clippers  1</span>  described above in  FIG. 3  ( a ), ( b ). It may be apparent from the embodiment shown in  FIG. 3  ( a ), ( b ) that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem89">cutting edges  89</span>  and  90  can be suited to all of the nails having the three different types or shapes and can be used to cut all of such nails gently and softly without causing any unnatural deformations to the nails when they are being cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0070]    In the embodiment shown in  FIG. 6  ( a ), the one and the other cutting edge portions may be provided separately by cutting the single plate along the center line thereof into the two separate parts, the one cutting edge may be provided on the tip edge of the one cutting edge portion facing opposite the other cutting edge portion while the other cutting edge may be provided on the tip edge of the other cutting edge portion facing opposite the one cutting edge portion. In the above manner, the one cutting blade and the other cutting blade may be provided so that they can face opposite each other. When a particular nail is then to be cut, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem89">cutting edge  89</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90">cutting edge  90</span>  can be placed in the completely closed state without any gap being left therebetween. Specifically, it may be apparent from the embodiment described above in  FIG. 6  ( a ) that the one cutting blade and the other cutting blade which have thus been formed to face opposite each other can permit the cutting edge and the other cutting edge to be placed in the completely closed state without any gap being left therebetween. This applies to all nails regardless of whatever types or shapes the nails may have.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0071]    The embodiment in  FIG. 6  ( a ) is substantially similar to the preceding embodiment in  FIG. 3  ( a ), ( b ) and  FIG. 5  ( a ), ( b ) in that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">cutting blades  84</span>  and  85  may be provided by cutting the single plate into the two separate parts, but is only different from the preceding embodiment in that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">two cutting blades  84</span>  and  85  thus provided can be attached to or detached from the corresponding tips of the pair of cutting edge supporting members and can be moved closer to or farther away from each other. In the embodiment in  FIG. 6  ( a ), therefore, those parts or elements that are the same as those parts or elements described above in  FIG. 3  ( a ), ( b ) and  FIG. 5  ( a ), ( b ) will not be described any further and are only given like reference numerals.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0072]    When the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">cutting blades  84</span>  and  85  are to be attached to the corres<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem81">ponding cutting blade mounting portions  81</span>  and  82 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">those cutting blades  84</span>  and  85  may be attached by screwing any suitable fixing pieces of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem92">metal  92</span>  and  93  such as bolts into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem86">threaded holes  86</span>  and  87  provided in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem81">cutting edge mounting portions  81</span>  and  82  through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem91">mounting holes  91</span>  and  92  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">cutting blades  84</span>  and  85  ( FIG. 6  ( c )).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0073]    It may be apparent from the above description that the construction may be such that it allows the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">cutting blades  84</span>  and  85  to be attached to the corres<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem81">ponding cutting blade mounting portions  81</span>  and  82  formed on the tips of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">levers  20</span>  and  21 . Thus, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">existing cutting blades  84</span>  and  85  including the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem89">worn cutting edges  89</span>  and  90  may be replaced by the new cutting blades including the polished cutting edges. This can be done in the easy manner.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0074]    As one example of the means for mounting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">cutting blade  84</span>  and  85  to the corres<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem81">ponding cutting blade mounting portions  81</span>  and  82 , it has been described that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">cutting blades  84</span>  and  85  may be attached by screwing any suitable fixing pieces of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem92">metal  92</span>  and  93  such as bolts into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem86">threaded holes  86</span>  and  87  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem81">cutting blade mounting portions  81</span>  and  82  through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem91">mounting holes  91</span>  and  92  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">cutting blades  84</span>  and  85 . This means is simply one example. The present invention is not limited to this example but it should be appreciated that other mounting means may be provided.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0075]    Although the present invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments thereof illustrated in the accompany drawings, the present invention is not limited to those embodiments but it should be understood that the present invention may be varied in various ways or manners without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.  </p>
