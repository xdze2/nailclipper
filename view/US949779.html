                        <p>  To all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, AUGUST IV. BABE, a citizen of the United States, residing in the city of Newark, county of Essex, and State of New Jersey, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Clippers; and I do declare the following to be a full, clear, and exact description of the same, such as will enable others skilled in the art to which it pertains to make, construct, and use the same.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My invention relates to clipping devices, and the construction of the same is applicable to nail clipping devices, cigar clipping devices and kindred instruments.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the physical embodiment of my invention, I have illustrated the same in the drawings as applicable to a nail clipper, and also to a cigar clipper. These two applications of my invention, however, do not embody all of the uses to which the invention may be put, but serve simply to illustrate the structure as a whole.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The principal object of my invention is to provide a clipping device of such a na ture, that it may be used for the purposes intended, and also serve the additional purpose of an ornamental watch charm or kindred ornament, and embody the use of an ornamental casing in which is inclosed the operative mechanism for actuating the jaws of the clipper.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the accompanying drawings illustrat ing the principle of operation, I have shown several modifications of the means for retaining the actuating lever in its position within the contour of the casing.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 1 illustrates a plan view of my improvement. Fig. 2 illustrates a longitudinal section of the same, showing the cam lever in closed position. Fig. 3 illustrates a similar view with the cam lever and jaws open, showing a modified form of latch. Fig. at illustrates a side view of a modified form of the means for retaining the cam lever within the casing. Fig. 5 illustrates a still further modification of the means for retaining the cam lever within the casing. Fig. 6 illustrates a detail of the modification shown in Fig. 5; and Figs. 7 and 8 illustrate respectively a front end and a partial side view of my invention, as a cigar clipper.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Similar letters of reference refer to like parts throughout the specification and drawings.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In the several views illustrating my improvements, a represents a tubular case of more or less ornamental contour for containing the working parts of the device. This case is provided on its upper side with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> slot 6</span>, through which the pivoted cam lever 0 may project. This lever c is pivoted in the casing at (Z, and has the forward cam projection e and the lower cam projection f. The lever 0 also projects rearwardly and is provided at its rear end with a shoulder g and a sharp -pointed cleaning device it. Upon its under side and about midway of its length, I locate a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> rigid catch member 2</span>&#39;, which is utilized in connection with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> mating catch member 70</span> for retaining the lever c in its closed position as illustrated in Fig. 2. This catch member is is pivoted in the case at Z, and projects through an opening m in the side of the case, and terminates either in the ring a or the projecting hook or loop arm n as illustrated respectively in Figs. 2 and 3. The purpose of the ring ais to serve as a means for releasing the operating lever c, to permit it to swing into the position shown in Fig. 3. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> ring 17</span>. also serves as a means by which the clipper may be attached to a watch chain or other device connected with the person of the user.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The forward end of the case 0 is open as illustrated in the several views, and from this open end project the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem79"> jaws 0 and 79</span>, each provided with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> ears 0 and 7</span>) respectively, by which the jaws are pivoted to the case by means of the pivot g. Surrounding the pivot g is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> coiled spring 9</span>, the ends of which are bent outwardly, and bear upon the ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> jaws 0 and 72</span> to spread them apart as illustrated in Fig. 3. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem79"> jaws 0 and 79</span> extend rearwardly, the jaw 0 having the arm 0 which bears upon the cam c of the lever c. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem79"> jaw 79</span> has the corresponding but<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem79"> longer arm 79</span> for cooperation with the cam f of the lever c.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In operation, when the locking catch f is released from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> catch member 2</span>&#39;, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> spring 9</span> bearing with its ends upon the jaws 0 and p, serve to spread said jaws, as above described, and having a considerable tension, will throw the lever into the position illustrated in Fig. 3. In this position, with the jaws open and the lever 0 as shown, as pressure is brought to bear upon the lever c to press the same into the body of the case a, it will be readily seen that the jaws 0 and p are brought together, and inasmuch as they are provided with sharp cutting edges, will retain the same in position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  clip any article, as for example, the finger nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The exposed surface of the lever 0 is provlded with a file for use as a nail file.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The structure illustrated in Fig. 3 with the loop a, may be used merely as a pocketcase a as shown in Fig. at. When the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> proj ecting end 9</span> of the lever 0 is in the position shown, this<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> loop 7</span> may be swung over<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> said projecting end 9</span> and thus retain the same in position. If desired, I may secure a ring a to the outside of the case a, as a means for attaching the clipper to the person of the user, as for example, to his watch chain.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As a still further modification of the means for retaining the lever 0 within the case, I may use the structure illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6, wherein the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71"> retaining catch 71</span> is located near the extremity of the lever 0 and adjacent to the end of the case a, thereby forming an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> open slot 2</span>&#39; in the end of the lever 0. Projecting axially from the end of the case a, I place the sliding catch member .9 having the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> laterally projecting pin 5</span> extending through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> slot 8</span> in the end of the casing, as shown in Fig. 5. This<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> pin 8</span> is designed to enter the slot of the lever 0 and pass over a small hump d in said slot to I may also provide the sliding catch member s with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> external ring 8</span> as a means for attaching the entire structure to the person of the wearer, as for example, to his watch chain. It will be clearly seen that when the catch member s is pulled outwardly to the limit of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> slot 8</span> the lever 0 will be released, when it may be operated in the manner hitherto described in connection with the other modifications.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Other means for retaining the lever 0 within the case may be used if desired, those illustrated merely serving to show several forms which my improvements may take.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In Figs. 7 and 8, I have shown the jaws 0 and p as overlapping, and provided with cutting edges suitable for clipping the tips from cigars, the aws in each case being shown in the position corresponding to Fig. 3, the operation of which will be readily understood from the other drawings.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Other forms of jaws for other purposes may be provided, the particular use for which will suggest the particular form or contour of the cutting edge to the maker or user.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  I claim:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1. A clipper comprising a closed casing, a pair of cutting jaws each pivotally secured within said casing and means for opening and closing said jaws.   </p>
