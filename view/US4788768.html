                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> The nail clipper is provided with a guard means formed of two curved members. After pivoting from the protective position, the two curved members can be pivoted relative to each other to form a finger grip for the manipulation of the clipper to cut nails. The two curved members are held on the clipper by a leaf spring. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> This invention relates to a nail clipper having a guard means. More particularly, this invention relates to a nail clipper having a combination guard means and finger grip.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Heretofore, various types of nail clippers have been constructed with guards and with grips. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,960,766 and 3,316,634 describe nail clippers having guard for protecting against injury from sharp cutting edges. In one case, a guard is rotatable into a position between the usual cutting edges of the nail clipper when not in use. In the other case, a pivotally mounted member is provided for covering over the cutting edges of a clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,997,966 and 4,176,449 describe nail clippers with various types of finger grips in order to improve the gripping of the clipper for use. In one case, handles are provided on the components of the nail clipper while in the other case, a conventional nail clipper is incorporated into a clamping bar arrangement.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Generally, the constructions described in the above-noted patents may be adequate to satisfy the limited objects intended. However, none provide a nail clipper of simple construction wherein a user is protected from injury by the sharp cutting edges while also providing a simple means for the handling of the clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to reduce the chance of injury caused by the sharp cutting edges of a nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is another object of the invention to enhance the manipulation of a nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is another object of the invention to increase the handleability of a nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is another object of the invention to provide a nail clipper of relatively simple construction which not only guards against injury from sharp cutting edges but also improves the handleability of the clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Briefly, the nail clipper is constructed with a pair of jaws each of which has a clipping edge facing a clipping edge of the other jaw and a guard means which is mounted on one of the jaws in order to move between a first position covering over the cutting edges and a second position spaced from the edges. In addition, the guard means includes a pair of curved members which are pivotally connected to each other for movement between a mating position while covering over the cutting edges and an opposed position to form a finger grip for actuation of the jaws.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The basic construction of the nail clipper is of conventional nature. For example, the jaws are spring biased away from each other while being connected at a remote end by a rivet. A post is provided at the distal end of the jaws and passes through the jaws in rotatably mounted relation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Also, an operating arm is mounted on one end of the post for rotation with the post while also being pivotally mounted to pivot about an axis transverse to the post. A suitable cam means is provided on the arm for moving the jaws together in response to pivoting of the arm towards one jaw when in a selected operating position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The guard means is mounted on the clipper on an opposite side from the operating arm. Thus, when the nail clipper is in use, a finger can be inserted into the finger grip while the thumb is pressed against the operating arm. Should the nail clipper then be released, the clipper would be retained on the finger passed through the finger grip.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In order to mount the guard means on the nail clipper, the guard means includes a leaf spring which is secured at one end to a jaw while the opposite end holds one of the curved members in pivotal relation. A suitable stop is also provided on this curved member for abutting the leaf spring when in the open position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The guard means which is provided on the nail clipper can be made of relatively few parts and may be readily manipulated with one hand. For example, when the nail clipper is in a stored position, the operating arm is substantially flat against one jaw while the guard means covers over the cutting edges. The guard means may then be pivoted away from the cutting edges and one of the curved members may then be rotated into a position to form the grip portion. Thereafter, the operating arm can be manipulated in the usual fashion so as to be positioned for closing the jaws together. With a thumb then on the operating arm, the index finger in the grip portion and the middle finger at the remote end of the clipper, the clipper may be actuated for the cutting or nipping of nails. In the event that the thumb and middle fingers are removed, the clipper would remain on the index finger.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Closing of the clipper into the closed position would be performed in a reverse manner.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In order to enhance the protective position of the guard means over the cutting edges of the clipper, the two curved members are pivotally connected by a rivet which has a head for slidably engaging against the cutting edges of the jaws when in the closed position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      These and other objects and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:  </p>

                        <p>      FIG. 5 illustrates a fully opened position of the clipper of FIG. 1 in a position for use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> has a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaws 11</span> which are connected together at a remote end for example by means of a rivet or a weld. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaws 11</span> are made of conventional materials and shaped so as to be spring biased away from each other in the position illustrated . In addition,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> each jaw 11</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> sharp clipping edge 12</span> at the distal end facing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> clipped edge 12</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> other jaw 11</span>. As is known, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> post 13</span> having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> rivet head 13</span>&#39; passes through suitable apertures near the distal ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaws 11</span> in a rotatably mounted relation. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> post 13</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> notch 14</span> near the upper end, as viewed, to receive an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> operating arm 15</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> operating arm 15</span> is provided in a conventional manner with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> bar-like portion 16</span> (see FIG. 3) which fits into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> notch 14</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> post 13</span> so as to be pivotally mounted relative to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> post 13</span> while also being retained in place against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> upper jaw 11</span>, as viewed. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> arm 15</span> also has an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> aperture 17</span> near the pivoted end in order to pass over the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> post 13</span> when being pivoted about an axis transverse to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> post 13</span>. As indicated in FIGS. 2 and 4, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> arm 15</span> can be rotated with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> post 13</span> and may also be pivoted about the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> post 13</span>. Further, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> arm 15</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cam means 18</span> in the form of a raised shoulder which is used to move the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaws 11</span> together in a conventional manner when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> arm 15</span> is brought from an open position as indicated in FIG. 5 towards the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaws 11</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaws 11</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> arm 15</span> are shaped in similar manner with curved sides. The resulting compact curved shape provides anchorage for a plastic sleeve or covering (not shown) to be placed over each of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaws 11</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> arm 15</span> to enhance contact with the user&#39;s fingertips. Also, the use of plastic sleeves or a covering permits advertising media or a name to be printed thereon.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> guard means 19</span> is mounted on a side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> clipper 10</span> opposite the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> operating arm 15</span>. This<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> guard means 19</span> is pivotally mounted to move between a first closed position as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 covering over the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutting edges 12</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaws 11</span> to a second opened position, as shown in FIG. 4, spaced from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutting edges 12</span>. In addition, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> guard means 19</span> is formed of a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> curved<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> members 20, 21</span></span> which are pivotally connected to each other by means of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> rivet 22</span> for movement between a mating position as shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 4 and an opposed position as indicated in FIG. 5 to form a finger grip for actuating of the jaws.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As indicated in FIG. 4, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> outer curved member 20</span> may be contoured so as to enhance the shape for gripping by a finger, such as the index finger of a user. In this case, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> inner curved member 21</span> is of small shape and contour and is provided with a free end. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> rivet 22</span> is suitably sized to permit free rotation of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> two me<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">mbers 20, 21</span></span> relative to each other. Further, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> member<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">s 20, 21</span></span> may be shaped so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> inner member 21</span> forms a locking fit when pivoted into the closed position illustrated in FIG. 4. To this end,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> each m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">ember 20, 21</span></span> may be formed on a different curve from the other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> rivet 22</span> which connects the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> member<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">s 20, 21</span></span> together, has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> head 23</span> facing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaws 11</span> so that when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> rivet head 23</span> is in the position illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> head 23</span> slidably engages against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutting edges 12</span>. This serves to retain the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> guard means 19</span> in place when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> clipper 10</span> is not in use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As indicated in FIG. 5, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> outer curved member 20</span> also has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> stop 24</span> which is formed by an integrally projecting portion.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As indicated in FIG. 2, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> guard means 19</span> also includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> leaf spring 25</span> which is secured at a remote end to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> lower jaw 11</span>. To this end, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> leaf spring 25</span> has an elongated portion at the remote end which clamps about a narrowed portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaw 11</span>. In addition, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> leaf spring 25</span> has a curved distal end which forms a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> hook 26</span> which passes through an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> opening 27</span> (see FIG. 1) in the remote end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> curved member 20</span> in order to hold the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> curved<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> members 20, 21</span></span> on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> lower jaw 11</span> in pivotal relation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In order to use the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> clipper 10</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> guard means 19</span> is pivoted away from the protective position shown in FIG. 1 into the position shown in FIG. 4. Next, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> inner curved member 21</span> is pivoted into the position shown in FIG. 5 so as to form a finger grip of circular shape. A user may then insert an index finger into the finger grip for subsequent manipulation of the clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> operating arm 15</span> of the clipper is manipulated in conventional fashion so as to first rotate with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> post 13</span> from the position shown in FIG. 1 and thereafter pivoted about a transverse axis through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> post 13</span> into the position shown in FIG. 4.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      With the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> arm 13</span> in the operating position and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> guide means 19</span> opened to form a finger grip portion as illustrated in FIG. 5, the user may then use the clipper. In this respect, for example, an index finger is inserted through the finger grip formed by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> member<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">s 20, 21</span></span>, a thumb is pressed against the free end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> arm 15</span> and a middle finger is engaged against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaws 11</span> on the side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> guard means 19</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> arm 15</span> can then be moved towards the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaw 11</span> in order to bring the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutting edges 12</span> together. Since the finger grip permits retention of the clipper on the index finger, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> clipper 10</span> can be moved into different positions for the clipping of nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Of note, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> clipper 10</span> may also be used when in the position shown in FIG. 4. In this case, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> curved<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> member 20, 21</span></span> provide a handle for manipulating the clipper into various positions. For example, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> curved<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> members 20, 21</span></span> could be held between an index finger and a middle finger of a user.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As illustrated in FIG. 5, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> stop 24</span> on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> outer curved member 20</span> abuts against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> leaf spring 25</span> when the guard is moved into the retracted position. Thus, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> stop 24</span> serves to establish the retracted position for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> guard means 19</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The invention thus provides a nail clipper of relatively simple construction which has a guard means which not only serves to protect against injury from the sharp cutting edges of the clipper but also which provides a finger grip for holding the clipper during manipulation. </p>
