                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A holder permits a conventional nail clipper to be operated with only a downward press of one finger or one toe, with the hand or foot having the nail to be cut resting on a common surface with the holder; a toenail can be cut without need to sit or to bend over if such would help a sufferer with arthritis or would speed up the nail cutting process, the clipper butt end instantly slips into a socket in the block-like base of the holder, and is as quickly removed; a portion of the clipper with the jaws protrudes upwardly and forwardly beyond the holder and the socket has an incline downwardly toward the rear that tips the jaws upward for safe visibility and for increasing the securance of the clipper in the socket under pressure of nail cutting. </p>

                        <p> FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This invention relates generally to supports and specifically to an improved holder for fingernail and toenail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This invention provides a nail clipper support system which permits the user to clip fingernails and toenails by simple downward pressure of a finger or toe.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In the prior art various U.S. patents have disclosed devices related to aspects of the field of this invention, including the following:  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 2,467,589 issued to G. E. Johannson on Apr. 18, 1949, disclosed a nail cutter mounted inside a box, into which the nail is extended;  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S Pat. No. 3,180,025 issued to Y. Tsunemi on Apr. 27, 1965, disclosed a hinged casing that can attach to a nail clipper and is relatively broad; however this casing has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> protrusion 11</span> in the lower face that would prevent it from resting in flat and stable relation on a surface such as a table and a low elevation that would render the cutting jaws of the clipper relatively inaccessible while on a table;  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 3,855,698 issued to K. R. Crosby on Dec. 24, 1974, disclosed a nail clipper within a housing but with the clipping end substantially concealed and with a height if laid on a table, rendering the clipping end substantially inaccessible;  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 3,903,596 issued to K. R. Crosby on Sept. 9, 1975 disclosed another form of enclosed clipper, this one of a special or unconventional design, with the clipping end relatively inaccessible and the height of the clipping end too low to permit operation while the case rests on a table;  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 3,943,948 issued to J. A. Satore on Mar. 16, 1976 disclosed a conventional clipper in a casing, the casing having a pivoted lid which evidently would be unstable as a base set on a table; the height of the clipper is evidently too low for operation resting on a table, and the clipping end is relatively inaccessible.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      However, no known device provided the advantages of the present system according to the objects thereof, which include:  </p>
                    
                        <p>      to provide a system as described that requires no other support for operation of a conventional nipper type nail clipper than a unitary box that the nail cutter drops into and that holds in position the clipper for operation by a simple push to clip either a fingernail or a toenail, with good, safe, visual and physical access;  </p>
                    
                        <p>      to provide a system as described that permits operation by push of a toe so that toenails can be cut with no bending required;  </p>
                    
                        <p>      to provide a system as described which is size adaptable in construction to fit either fingernail clippers or toenail clippers;  </p>
                    
                        <p>      to provide a system as described that is low in cost to make, sell and purchase, is as easy to use with left hand or foot as it is with right hand or foot, that requires no cleaning and can be quickly set up, or knocked down for storage, that is quiet in operation and that is durable and attractive in appearance, and  </p>
                    
                        <p>      to provide a system as described which is particularly well adapted for use by arthritics and others who find bending difficult or impossible but who can trim toenails while sitting upright or even standing, using this invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>

                        <p>      BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIGS. 1 and 2 show the invention in embodiment 10, holding a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> conventional nail clipper 20</span> made from three pieces of flat stock and a fastener. The nail clipper is of the type having an elongate cutting head of spring-tempered metal. At the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> first or front end upper jaw 22</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lower jaw 24</span> cutting edges are in spaced opposition in a vertical plane, and have respective substantially transverse to them su<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">bstanti<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">ally congruous rearward extensions 26, 28</span></span> which are joined as end portions flat together in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> butt 30</span> at the second end of the cutting head. The jaws are sprung apart becuase they are slightly at an angle to each other, and means is provided to force them together in cutting, in the form of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> member 32</span> such as a rivet affixed to the lower jaw as by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> protrusive head 34</span> on the underside and extending upwardly through both jaws where it is pivotally engaged by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> bent end 36</span> of a handle portion that lies on the upper surface of the upper jaw rearward extension, either with or without an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> integral fulcrum protrusion 38</span>. The reminder of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> handle 40</span> extends upwardly towards the rear at about a 45Â° angle. Ordinarily such a clipper is manually held and to cut, the handle is squeezed toward the butt after being located with a jaw on either face of a fingernail or toenail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In The system of the present invention, however, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> handle 40</span> can simply be pressed down with one finger F, and the finger or toe having the fingernail or toenail N to be cut can be rested on the floor S or table or other surface supporting the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> bottom portion 42</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> base 44</span> of the holder.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> nail clipper 20</span> is instantly secured in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> holder 10</span> by one motion of the hand of a user or removed from it, by simply slipping the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> butt 30</span> of the clipper into or out of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> socket 46</span> in the base. The socket freely receives and fits the thickness of the butt and also the width. The harder the handle is pressed (arrow) the more securely the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> butt 30</span> is held. Because the base has an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> incline 48</span> downwardly towards the rear or second end, and the incline continues into the socket as the floor portion, pressure for forcing the jaws together tends to force the end of the butt against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> socket end wall 50</span>; the separation shown is for exposition, preferably they are in contact. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> incline may be about 7</span> to 10 degrees. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> rivet head 34</span> may engage the front edge of the base and serve to stop rearward motion, if desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Projection of the nail clipper ahead of the base should be at <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">least one-half inch (13</span> mm).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It will be appreciated that although the rearward extensions of the jaws spring together and apart, the butt does not, and this and the underlying support by the inclined top portion co-act to prevent shifting.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Upward incline of the front end of the nail clipper is also a means for providing safe, good visibility of the cutting edges on nail insertion and during cutting, regardless of whether the nail being clipped is on a hand or foot resting on the same supporting surface as the holder, or is on a book or other support for adjustment and comfort.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> base 44</span> is substantially rectangular, and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> may be about 21</span>/4 inches by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">4 inches (5</span>.5 by 11 cm) in plane with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> flat top 54</span> or ledge portion at the rear which is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> about 1</span> 9/16  (4 cm) high, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> front <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">edge 56<<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">/span> about 1</span> 7/16 inch (3</span>.5 cm) high, and a socket depth of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">11/16 inch (2</span>.5 cm) as measured into the ledge portion.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The base may be simply a solid block of wood, or may be of hollow thermoplastic, in either case very economical. It preferably has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> non-skid or cushioning bottom pad 58</span> of rubber or felt.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIG. 3 shows embodiment 300 that may be like the first embodiment except that it may hold different-size clippers, fingernail and toenail sizes respectively, in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem330"> socket<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem330">s 330 and 330</span></span>&#39;. If desired, the two (or more) clipper sizes can be held in individual holders.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIG. 4 shows that in an embodiment, such as 400 shown, the file that is customarily supplied on the upper portion of the upper jaw rearward extension with some nail clippers of the type, can be accommodated in an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem460"> upward clearance 460</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem430"> slot 430</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This invention is not to be constructed as limited to the particular forms disclosed herein, since these are to be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive. It is, therefore, to be understood that the invention may be practiced within the scope of the claims otherwise than as specifically described. </p>
