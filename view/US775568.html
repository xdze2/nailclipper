                        <p>   Be it known that 1</span>, FRANK B. LA MAY, of Rochester, in the county of Monroe and State of New York, have invented certain new and 5 useful Improvements in Manicuring Implements; and I do hereby declare the following to be a full, clear, and exact description of the same, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, forming a part of this speci- Io fication, and to the reference-numerals marked thereon.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My present invention relates to improvements in that class of devices that are particularly useful in trimming, filing, cleaning,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">   </p>
                    
                        <p>  I 5</span> and performing similar operations upon the finger and toe nails of a person; and it is the object of my invention to provide a device of this character that will perform&#39;these operations in the simplest and most convenient manner and which is capable of being manipulated and handled with the greatest facility without impairing the usefulness of the device.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To these and other ends my invention consists in certain improvements and combina- 2 tions of parts thatwill be hereinafter more fully explained, the novel features being pointed out particularly in theclaims hereunto annexed.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the drawings, Figure l is a view, partly in section, showing anail-trimming device em- 3 bodying my invention, the operating-lever being in operative position. Fig. 2 is a similar view showing the operating-lever and the jaws in their relatively closed positions. Fig. 3 is a View of&#39;the device in elevation, the operating-lever being in an intermediate position;   </p>
                    
                        <p>  and Fig. 4 is a similar View showing the operating-lever in a reversed position. Figs. 5 and 6 aretop and bottom plan views, respec- O tively, of the device; and Fig. 7 is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> sectional 4</span> view through the connecting link or pin on the line a; w of Fig. 4:.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In the several views the same numerals of reference designate similar parts.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The present embodiment of my invention comprises generally the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> opposi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ng jaws 1 and 2</span></span>, which are composed in the present instance of a pair of plates which are preferably made of resilient material and are united at<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> one end 5</span>, which conforms approximately to the curvature of the finger-tips, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> opposing jaw 1</span> is also provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> similarly-formed recess 6</span>, either or both of the jaws being provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> cutting edge 7</span>, which is formed to cooperate with the opposing jaw and preferably has a curvature of such a configuration as will enable the nail to be readily trimmed into the desired shape. These<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> jaws 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> and 2</span></span> are each provided with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> perfor<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">ations 8 and 9</span></span>, respectively, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> aperture 9</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> jaw 2</span><span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> being provided witha countersunk recess 10</span>, which is preferably formed oblong, rectangular, or otherwise angularly shaped, and in this countersunk recess is adapted to fit the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> correspondingly-shaped head 11</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> pin or link 12</span>, the stem of the latter extending through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> apertu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">res 8 and 9</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> jaws 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> and 2</span></span>, respectively, and terminating in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> curved or hooked portion 13</span>. This curved or hooked portion of the pin or link is adapted to cooperate with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> operating member 14</span>., which in the present instance is forked at one end in such a manner as to admit the said hooked portion of the pin, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> pivot 15</span> being provided between the forks for engaging beneath the said hooked portion of the pin, that portion of the operating member in proximity to the said pivot being disposed at an oblique angle to the body of the member in order that the extremities of the latter will constitute a relatively laterally arranged projection at one side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> said pivot 15</span>, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> bent portion 16</span> will constitute a similar projection upon the opposite side of the said pivot, such an arrangement causing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> projection 16</span> to bear against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> adjacent jaw 1</span>, and thereby move the latter toward the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> opposing jaw 2</span>, when the free end of the operating member is manipulated toward the device from a position similar to that shown in Fig. 1, thus causing the sharpened cutting edge to sever that portion of the nail which it may be desirable to have removed, the jaws and the operating-lever at this time occupying a position similar to that shown in Fig. 2. When the operation of severing the nails has been completed, the operating member may be thrown over into the position shown in Fig. 3 in order that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> file or roughened portion 17</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pointed implement 18</span>, which are preferably formed upon the operating member, may be rendered convenient and accessible for use, the jaws or body portion of the device at this time serving as a handle during this operation. By swinging the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> operating lever or member 14</span> about the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> pin 12</span> as a center until it assumes a position similar to that shown in Figs. 1 and 5 the device will occupy a comparatively small compass or space that Will enable it to be conveniently carried upon the person, and while the operating-lever occupies such a position the extremity of the said lever adjacent to the pin will be so disposed relatively to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> pivot 15</span> of the lever that the resiliency or spring action of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> jaws 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> and 2</span></span> will operate to retain the operating member closed or in immediate proximity thereto.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   For the purpose of preventing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> connecting-pin 12</span> from turning accidentally or too easily and in order to insure the proper positioning of the operating member I provide the angularlyshaped countersunk recess in which the correspondingly-shaped head upon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> pin 12</span> rests, and as the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> jaws 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> and 2</span></span> are preferably so fitted together that their resilient action normally tends to separate them it will be readily understood thatfthe pressure thus produced will operate to retain the angularly-shaped head of the pin in such a position within the recess as to normally resist the turning of the pin; but when sufficient force is exerted upon the pin by manipulating the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> operating-lever 14</span> the pressure exerted between the head of the pin and the jaws will be overcome, thus permitting the pin to be rotated into its reversed position, in which positionit will be retained by the seating of the angularly-shaped head of the pin within the correspondingly-shaped portion of the recess.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A&#39;device of the character described is particularly useful and convenient as an implement for trimming and dressing the finger and toe nails of a person, and it is so constructed as to simplify and facilitate the manipulation and operation of the device, and in practice the handle I may be employed to enable the device to be conveniently and steadily held or grasped by the hand of the operator,the handle being preferably omitted, as in Figs. 2, 3, and 4:, when it is desirable to render the device capable of being conveniently carried in the pocket or other small receptacle or space.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  I claim as my invention- 1. Inadevice of the character described, the   </p>
