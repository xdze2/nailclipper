The sliding locking piece has a pulling button which protrudes outside the body. The upper cutting part is movably connected to the front end of the body and has an opening at its rear end. The pressing piece is movably connected through a pivot to the middle front part of the body and its rear end bends downwards and can hook onto the sliding locking piece. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The present invention relates to a nail clipper and more particularly pertains to a portable nail clipper as a tool for manicure and pedicure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    There are various technical proposals relating to nail clippers. Most of the nail clippers are inconvenient and dangerous to carry because their cutting edges do not bite together for storage. There are some nail clippers with the cutting edges biting together for storage. The simplest method is to provide a cap to cover the cutting edges, but it is easy to lose the cap. Attaching the cap onto the clipper body can avoid losing the cap but it hinders the use of the nail clipper. Another method is to add a cover plate which is connected to the clipper body. The cover plate is structured to press the pressing piece when folded for storage, thereby locking the cutting edges to a position that they bite together. Although this method is more practical, as the pressing piece is persistently pressed by the cover plate when folded for storage, prolonged use renders the pressing piece becoming deformed or losing elasticity and so the pressing piece cannot function eventually. In order for the nail clipper to be simple to use and for the cutting edges thereof to bite together for storage, many technical proposals require many parts and components, more complex assembling and higher production costs and are inconvenient to use. To nail clippers such goods for daily use which are small in size and easily lost and have to be discarded once the cutting edges become blunt, it is difficult for the market to widely accept nail clippers which are too expensive and complicated to use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The prior art therefore cannot fully satisfy the demands of the consuming public. The market is still looking forward to a nail clipper which is safe and reliable, small in size, convenient to carry, easy to fold for storage, equipped with a durable pressing piece that does not deform and is susceptible of a low selling price.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    In view of the aforesaid disadvantages now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a nail clipper which is safe and reliable, small in size, convenient to carry, easy to fold for storage, equipped with a durable pressing piece that does not deform and is susceptible of a lower production cost.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    To attain this, the present invention generally comprises a body, an upper cutting part, a lower cutting part and a pressing piece, wherein the body is in the shape of a box which is open at the top and is open at the bottom near the front end, and has the lower cutting part at its front end and a sliding locking piece at its rear end. The sliding locking piece is connected by a return spring to the rear end of the body and has a pulling button which protrudes outside the body and can bring along the sliding locking piece to slide inwards. The upper cutting part is movably and pivotably connected to the front end of the body and through a spring piece it is connected to and can bite with the lower cutting part. The position of the cutting edge at the front end of the upper cutting part corresponds to the position of the cutting edge at the front end of the lower cutting part. The upper cutting part has an opening at its rear end. The pressing piece is movably and pivotably connected through a pivot to the middle front part of the body, and a small elongated hole is opened at the connecting position on each of the left and right sides of the pressing piece for the pivot to pass through. The bottom of the pressing piece is connected to one end of a spring, and the other end of which is connected to the pivot. The front end of the pressing piece is inserted into the opening at the rear end of the upper cutting part, and the rear end of the pressing piece bends downwards and can hook onto the sliding locking piece at the rear end of the body.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    A recess is disposed near the front end at the bottom of the pressing piece, and the opening at the rear end of the upper cutting part forms a plane bending downwards which is substantially vertical or at an angle in relation to the top of the upper cutting part, and the opening can interlock with the recess.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    An emery board is disposed near the rear end at the bottom of the body for trimming nail edges.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    A hanging piece which is hollow in the middle is disposed at the rear end of the body so that the whole nail clipper can be hanged and kept securely.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    When the present invention is not in use, the rear end of the pressing piece is hooked onto the sliding locking piece at the rear end of the body so that the rear end of the pressing piece is locked at the rear end of the body. Since the rear end of the pressing piece is locked in a downward position and its front end inserts into the opening at the rear end of the upper cutting part, the upper cutting part is also locked in a downward position at the same time. The cutting edges of the upper cutting part and the lower cutting part are thereby locked in a state that they bite together. The nail clipper therefore becomes a small and flat box-shaped object which is convenient to carry. The secure locking construction also allows users to carry the nail clipper in a safe and reliable manner.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    To use the present invention, the user may first slightly pulls the pulling button forwards so that the return spring comes into a compressed state and brings along the sliding locking piece to slide inwards. The rear end of the pressing piece is no longer locked and therefore springs upwards. As the rear end of the pressing piece springs upwards, its front end then moves downwards. Since the front end of the pressing piece is inserted into the opening at the rear end of the upper cutting part, the downward-bending plane of the opening interlocks with the recess and thus triggers to move the upper cutting part upwards. The cutting edges of the upper cutting part and the lower cutting part thereby separate from each other. As the user presses near the rear end of the pressing piece, the upper cutting part moves downwards and the cutting edges of the upper cutting part and the lower cutting part bite together. The user repeatedly presses near the rear end of the pressing piece and through the spring piece the upper cutting part and the lower cutting part movably bite together and separate in sequence. As a result, the object of nail clipping is attained. The operation is easy and it is simple to use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    After finishing clipping, the user may slightly pull the rear end of the pressing piece, and the downward-bending plane of the opening will immediately separate from the recess. The user may then press the rear end of the pressing piece downwards and hook it onto the sliding locking piece at the rear end of the body. The rear end of the pressing piece is then locked at the rear end of the body, thereby folding the nail clipper into a flat and small box-shaped object. The operation is fast and easy.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    It is an object of the present invention to provide a nail clipper which is small in size, convenient to carry, easy to use and is easy to fold up for storage.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    It is another object of the present invention to provide a nail clipper which is equipped with secure locking structure which enables users to carry the nail clipper in a safe and reliable manner.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    It is also another object of the present invention to provide a nail clipper which is simple in construction with not many parts and components and is therefore easy to assemble.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a nail clipper with a durable pressing piece which does not deform.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    It is a further object of the present invention to provide a nail clipper which is susceptible of a low production cost and satisfies the demands of the consuming public, thus overcoming the disadvantages of prior art.  </p>

The position of the cutting edge at the front end of the upper cutting part  2  corresponds to the position of the cutting edge of the lower cutting part  3 , and the upper cutting part  2  has an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">opening  21</span>  at its rear end.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pressing piece  4</span>  is movably connected through a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">pivot  10</span>  to the middle front part of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">body  1</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">small elongated hole  41</span>  is opened at the connecting position on each of the left and right sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pressing piece  4</span>  for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">pivot  10</span>  to pass through. The bottom of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pressing piece  4</span>  is connected through a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">peg  11</span>  to one end of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">spring  12</span>  and the other end of which is connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">pivot  10</span> . The front end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pressing piece  4</span>  is inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">opening  21</span>  at the rear end of the upper cutting part  2 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">recess  42</span>  is disposed near the front end at the bottom of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pressing piece  4</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">opening  21</span>  at the rear end of the upper cutting part  2  forms a plane bending downwards which is substantially vertical or at an angle in relation to the top of the upper cutting part  2 , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">opening  21</span>  can interlock with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">recess  42</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The rear end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pressing piece  4</span>  bends downwards and can hook onto the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">sliding locking piece  5</span>  at the rear end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">body  1</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    An <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">emery board  13</span>  is disposed near the rear end at the bottom of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">body  1</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">hanging piece  14</span>  which is hollow in the middle is disposed at the rear end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">body  1</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    As illustrated in  FIGS. 2 and 4 , to use the nail clipper, the user may first slightly pull the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">pulling button  51</span>  forwards so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">return spring  6</span>  comes into a compressed position and brings along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">sliding locking piece  5</span>  to slide inwards. The rear end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pressing piece  4</span>  is no longer locked and springs upwards. As the rear end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pressing piece  4</span>  springs upwards, its front end then moves downwards. Since the front end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pressing piece  4</span>  is inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">opening  21</span>  at the rear end of the upper cutting part  2 , the downward-bending plane of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">opening  21</span>  interlocks with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">recess  42</span>  and thus triggers to move the upper cutting part  2  upwards. The cutting edges of the upper cutting part  2  and the lower cutting part  3  thereby separate from each other. As the user presses near the rear end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pressing piece  4</span> , the upper cutting part  2  moves downwards and the cutting edges of the upper cutting part  2  and the lower cutting part  3  bite together. The user repeatedly presses near the rear end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pressing piece  4</span>  and through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">spring piece  9</span>  the upper cutting part  2  and the lower cutting part  3  movably bite together and separate in sequence. As a result, the object of nail clipping is attained. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">emery board  13</span>  can be used to trim nail edges after finishing nail clipping.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    As illustrated in  FIGS. 5 and 6 , after finishing clipping, the user may slightly pull the rear end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pressing piece  4</span> , and the downward-bending plane of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">opening  21</span>  will immediately separate from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">recess  42</span> . The user may press the rear end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pressing piece  4</span>  downwards and hook it onto the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">sliding locking piece  5</span>  at the rear end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">body  1</span> . The rear end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pressing piece  4</span>  is then locked at the rear end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">body  1</span> . Since the rear end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pressing piece  4</span>  is locked in a downward position and its front end inserts into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">opening  21</span>  at the rear end of the upper cutting part  2 , the upper cutting part  2  is also locked in a downward position at the same time. The cutting edges of the upper cutting part  2  and the lower cutting part  3  are thereby locked in a state that they bite together. The nail clipper then becomes a small and flat box-shaped object. When the user carries the nail clipper, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">hanging piece  14</span>  can be used to hang the nail clipper onto other objects. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">hanging piece  14</span>  can also be used as a key ring.  </p>
