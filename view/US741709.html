                        <p>  To all whom it may concern.-   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, JOSEPH PETBELLI, of New Haven, in the county of New Haven and State of Connecticut, have invented a new and useful Improvement in Finger- Nail Trimmers; and I do hereby declare the following,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings and the letters of reference marked thereon, to be a full, clear, and exact description of the same, and which said drawings constitute part of this specification, and represent, in-   </p>

                        <p>  . ing simplicity and rigidity of construction and ease and effectiveness of operation; and the invention consists in the construction, as hereinafter described, and particularly recited in the claims.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In carrying out my invention I employ a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> fiat plate 2</span>,which for convenience I will hereinafter call the lower plate, this plate being formed at its outer end with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> curved cutting edge 3</span>. Connected with this<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lower plate 2</span> is an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> upper plate 4</span>, corresponding in outline to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lower plate 2</span> and formed at its outer end with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> cutting edge 5</span>, corresponding to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> cutting edge 3</span>. These plates or cutters are arranged substantially parallel with each other and are preferably united by f<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">orming substantially semicircular grooves 6</span> in opposite edges of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lower plate 2</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> corresponding grooves 7</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> upper plate 4</span>. Into these<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> grooves rings 8</span> are inserted, over the ends of which the edges of the plates within I the ring are turned, so as to hold the rings in their respective grooves, and thereby hinge the two plates together. If desired, and as shown in Fig. 7 of the drawings, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> inner outer edges ofthe rings 8</span>.may be beveled,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">   </p>
                    
                        <p>  forming chambers 9</span>, into which the edges of the plates within thering are forced. The inner faces of the plates forward of the rings are formed with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> chambers 12</span>, which receive the ends of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> coiled spring 13</span>,- one function of which is to force-the cuttingedges of the plates apart, and having th e&#39;further function of holding all the parts compactly together when the instrument is folded or closed.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Pivoted to the rear end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> upper plate 4</span> is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> lever 14</span>. To provide a fulcrum for this lever,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> I preferably mount apost 15</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lower plate 2</span>, which post projects upward preferably this postis swiveled in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lower plate 2</span> and provided at its upper end with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> oblong head 17</span>, which may project upward through a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> longitudinally-arranged slot 18</span> in the lever. When the lever is down upon the upper faceof the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> upper plate 4</span>, the   </p>
                    
                        <p>  through a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> slot 16</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> upper plate 4</span>, and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">   </p>
                    
                        <p>  head 17</span> projects above its upper face and may i be turned transversely to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> slot 18</span> and so .as to lock the lever more securely against the face of the upper plate, as shown in Fig. 2. When it is desired to use the cutter, however, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> head 17</span> is turned into line with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> slot 18</span>, after which the-lever may be raised to a position at substantially right angles to the upper plate, as shown in Fig. 3. When thus raised, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> post 15</span> may be turned by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> head 17</span> to its former locked positionand so as to form a fulcrum for&#39;the lever when the lever is turned downward, as shown in Fig. 4. Downward pressure upon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> lever thus bearing upon head 17</span> forces the cutting edges of the plates together, as shown in Fig. 4.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Thelower plate 2</span> may be provided at its Instead of providing the lever with a slot adapting it in its closed position to set over the post the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lower plate 2</span> may be provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> long tail or handle 20</span> of any desired form, preferably corresponding in width to the width of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> lever 14</span>, and so that the lever when turned backward may rest upon its upper face, against which it will be held by the force of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> spring 13</span>, the lever being provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> short projection 21</span> at its inner end. Like the construction first described, the fulcrum for the lever is a post projecting upward from the face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lower plate 2</span> through the upper plate, and the operation of the lever over this fulcrum is the same as before described. Instead of having the fulcrum or post extend upward through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> upper plate 4</span> it may be arranged as shown in Figs. 11, 12, and 13, in which a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> post or fulcrum 22</span> is mounted in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lower plate 2</span> in rear of the end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> upper plate 4</span>, in which case the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> lever 14</span> will be provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> shoulder 23</span>, which will bear upon the post or fulcrum when the lever is turned backward, the movement of the lever being the reverse of that last described in that in its closed position it is held against the upper face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> upper plate 4</span> by the action of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> spring 13</span>, while in cutting it is moved rearward i11 stead of forward, the action upon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> plate 4</span>, however, being the same-that is, the rear end of that plate is raised to force the cutting edges together.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Instead of mounting the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> post 15</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lower plate 2</span> it may be mounted in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> lever 14</span> and so as to extend downward through the two plates, as shown in Fig. 6, the head being adapted to bear upon the upper face of the lower plate when in operative position. It will be clearly apparent that instead of mounting the post or fulcrum in the lower plate or on the lever it may be divided between the two members and the ends arranged to come together in line with each other and operate in the same way as a single post.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The construction shown and described permits the device to be made in very compact and convenient form and readily assembled, thus enabling the production at a very low cost. It is much more rigid and reliable, being made of plates of substantial thickness, than the ordinary thin sheet-metal forms.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having fully described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1. A nail-trimmer comprising a flat upper plate and a fiat lower plate pivotally connected together, normally bearing upon each other throughout their adjacent surfaces and having coacting cutting edges, a lever pivoted to the rear end of the upper plate, and a post arranged to form a fulcrum for the said lever when the same is swung into its operative position, whereby and on account of the flat form and arrangement of the plates, the thickness of the device is reduced to the minimum.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2. A nail-trimmer comprising a flat lower plate and a fiat upper plate superimposed upon the lower plate, the said two plates connected together near their forward ends in planes parallel with each other, said plates formed at their forward ends with cutting edges, a lever pivoted at the rear end of the upper plate, a post or fulcrum between the lever and the lower plate, and a spring between the plates forward of the point of connection and adapted to act both to separate the edges and to hold the lever in its closed position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   3. A nail-trimmer comprising a fiat upper plate and a flat lower plate pivotally connected together,normally bearing upon each other throughout their adjacent surfaces and having coacting cutting edges, a lever pivoted to the rear end of the upper plate, and a post formed independently of and mounted in the lower plate in position to form a fulcrum for the said lever when the same is swung into its operative position, whereby and on account of the flat form and arrangement of the plates the thickness of the device is reduced to the minimum.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   4. A nail-trimmer comprising two plates arranged one upon the other, and provided with cutting edges at their outer ends, the sides of the two plates formed with corresponding semicircular grooves, rings inserted into said grooves, and the edges of the plates within the rings turned over the inner edges of the outer ends of said rings, whereby the rings are held in the grooves and the plates thereby hinged together, substantially as described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   5. A nail-trimmer comprising two plates arranged one upon the other and provided with cutting edges at their outer ends, the sides of the two plates formed with corresponding semicircular grooves, rings inserted into said grooves, the inner edges of the out-erends of the rings beveled and the edges of the plates within the rings turned over said bevels, whereby the rings are held in the grooves and the plates thereby hinged together, substantially as described;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   6. A nail-trimmer comprising two plates arranged one upon the other, hinged together, and provided at their outer ends with cutting edges, a swiveled post on the lower plate and projecting through the upper plate and form ed with an oblong head, a lever pivoted to the upper plate in rear of said post and formed with a slot in line with said post through which the post extends, the head of the post adapted to be turned over the outer face of the lever when the lever is in the closed position, substantially as described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In testimony whereof I have signed this specification in the presence of two subscribing witnesses.   </p>
