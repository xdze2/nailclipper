                        <p>  Patented Apr. 13, 1915.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Application filed August 5, 1913. Serial No. 783,168.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern Be it known that I, RAYMOND C. &#39;MINER, a citizen of the United States, residing at Faith, in the county of Meade and State of South Dakota, have invented a new and useful Finger-Nail Clipper, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The present invention appertains to fingernail clippers, and is particularly an improvement over the combination tool disclosed in my copending application filed March 10, 1913, Serial No. 753,336.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   One of the objects of the present invention is the provision of a novel finger nail clipper for use in a combination tool.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object of the present invention is to provide a key ring, or the&#39;like, which may be grasped or held in the hand to assist or facilitate clipping the finger nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Nith the foregoing and other objects in view, which will be apparent as the description proceeds, the invention resides in the combination and arrangement of parts and in the details of construction hereinafter described and claimed, it being understood that changes in the precise embodiment of the invention herein disclosed, can be made within the scope of what is claimed, without departing from the spirit of the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The present invention has been illustrated in its preferred embodiment in the accompanying drawing, wherein Figure 1 is a plan view ofthe device. Fig. 2 is an enlarged sectional detail taken through the finger nail clipper. Fig. 3 is an enlarged sectional detail taken on the line 3-3 of Fig. 1.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1n carrying out the invention, reference being had in detail to the drawing, there is provided a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> flat s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ections or leaves 1 and 2</span></span>, which are elongated, and which have their adjoining ends hinged together. 1n order to hinge these leaves together, the inner end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> leaf 2</span> is provided with a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> butts 3</span>, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> leaf 1</span> is provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> a single round butt or enlarged portion 1</span> fitting snugly between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> butts 3</span>, a hinge swing snugly around the hinge butts, and that edge of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> yoke 22</span> remote from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> leaf 1</span> is provided at its intermediate portion with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> shear edge or cutter 24</span> cooperating with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> shoulder 25</span> formed on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> butt 4</span> approximately at right angles to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> leaf 1</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> shoulder 25</span> provides a shear edge or cutter cooperating with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> shear edge or cutter 24</span> of the yoke, the shear edges or cutters being so curved as to accommodate the finger nails and to properly trim them. The other or opposite edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> yoke 22</span>, or that edge of the yoke disposed adjoining the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> leaf 1</span>, is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> knife blade 26</span> extending radially from the hinge butts or hinge pin, and forming a handle for the yoke or its cutter.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   WV hen the finger nail clipper and knife blade forming a part thereof, are not in use, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> is adapted to be swung against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> leaf 1</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The key ring embodies a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> wire loop 31</span>, the end portions of which are crossed, as at 32, and the ends of which are bent back toward each other, and tapered, to provide the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> pintles 33</span>. The ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> hinge pin 5</span> are provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> sockets 34</span>: adapted to receive the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> pintles 33</span>, it being noted that when the sides of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> loop 31</span> are compressed or forced together, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> pintles 33</span> will be spread so as to readily engage over the ends of the hinge pin, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> loop 31</span> having an expansive tension so as to spring the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> pintles 33</span> into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> sockets 34</span>. When the pintles are thus engaged to the ends of the hinge pin, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> loop 31</span> may be swung about the hinge butts, toward the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> respec<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">tive leaves 1 and 2</span></span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> loop 31</span> may be readily removed, as above intimated, and the keys or other articles may be readily engaged on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> loop 31</span>, by slipping them over one end of the loop, and working them through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> crossed portions 32</span>, as will be clearly apparent. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> crossed portions 32</span> are normally in contact, to retain the keys or other articles within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> loop 31</span> proper.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Particular attention is directed to the novel combination with the hinged leaves, of the finger nail clipper, knife blade, and key ring. The use of the knife blade and key ring of themselves will be clearly apparent, but it is to be noted that the knife blade and key ring are of particular advantage in connection with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> finger nail p 24</span> over the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> shoulder or cutter 25</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  clipper. As above stated, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> knife blade 26</span> the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> leaves land 2</span> being held together in any suitable manner, while the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> knife blade or handle 26</span> is swung so as to shear the cutter By inserting the finger nails over the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> shoulder or cutter 25</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> cutter 24</span> in being moved toward andover the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> cutter 25</span>, will sever a predetermined amount from the end of the finger nail. By repeating this operation, the finger nail or finger. nails may be conveniently clipped or trimmed, as desired. It is to be noted that the movement of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> yoke 22</span> is limited by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> steps 28</span>, and it is to be noted, that if desired, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> key ring 31</span> may be held in the hand, the finger nails of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> which 1</span> are to be trimmed, so as to steady the. hand,   </p>
                    
                        <p>   in order that the finger nails may be conveniently held on the,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> shoulder or cutter 25</span> while the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> handle or knife blade 26</span> is swung or manipulated. Thus, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> key ring 31</span> provides a handle, having a. yoke portion 3238 pivoted to the ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> hinge pin 5</span>, and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> whereby&#39;the handle 01</span>&#39; key ring may swing around that end of the, leaf or memher &#39;1 having the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> cutter 25</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having thus described the invention, what is claimed as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> new is: i I 1</span> In a fingernail clipper, a member having a round enlarged portion at one end provided with a cutter, and a yoke pivoted to the said enlarged portion to swing snugly around the same and having a handle, the   </p>
                    
                        <p>  yoke having a cutter adjacent the, said enlarged portion, arranged to shear over the aforesaid cutter.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2.
