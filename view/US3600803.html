The blade is already retained by the blade parts and assembly provides a self-contained unit for fixing the blade to the handle. The blade assembly and round head are so constructed that the blade assembly can be placed on the round head and retained rigidly in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90"> four diflerent 90</span> angle positions to expose the blade edges either transversely or longitudinally of the handle in the opposite end of the handle there is provided a slotted and elongated opening in which a liquid-treating device may be stored and which has a partial cover to close the slotted part of the opening of the handle when the device is thrust home into the handle opening. Protuberances and recesses are provided on the handle and the container to hold the same in the handle and also on the partial handle on the container to hold the same aligned with the container over the brush.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  CORN AND NAIL CUTTER This invention relates to a corn and nail cutter.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is the principal object of the present invention to provide a com and nail cutter in which a removable blade is carried between two parts and can be angled between a position extending transversely of the handle to adapt the cutter for cutting corns or callouses, or longitudinally of the handle to adapt the cutter for the cutting and trimming of toe-and-fingernails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is another object of the invention to provide a corn and nail cutter in which the blade edge can be extended either transversely or longitudinally of the handle without removing or disassembling the blade and its retaining parts.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is a further object of the invention to provide in a removable blade corn-and-nailcutting device an assemblage of retaining parts for the blade that can be handled as an assemblage to turn the assemblage upon the handle and on which there is provided finger, thumb-grasping portions to guard against the cutting of the thumb or finger while turning the blade between transversely and horizontally extending positions upon the handlev It is a still further object of the invention to provide in a corn and nail cutter a liquid-treating assemblage adapted to be stored in the lower end of the handle in such a manner that a brush forming a part of the liquid-treating device will be covered by a partial cover provided upon the liquid-treating device in combination with the handle as the liquid treating device is slid home into the handle end.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Other objects of the invention are to provide a com-andnail-cutting device, having the above objects in mind, which is of simple construction, durable and rigid in use, light in weight, of pleasing appearance, has a minimum number of parts, efficient and effective is use.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   For a better understanding of the invention, reference may be had to the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which:   </p>

                        <p>   FIG. 6 is a transverse sectional view of the liquid-treating device with its cover longitudinally aligned therewith and as viewed on line 6-6 of FIG. 4; and   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 7 is a perspective view of the corn and nail cutter with illustrations being made as to the manner that the blade assembly is removed from the handle head.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring now to the figures, 10 represents generally a bandle having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> round attaching head 11</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> blade assembly 12</span> adapted for attachment to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> round handle head 11</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> liquid-treating brush device 13</span> adapted to be inserted and stored in the rear end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> handle 10</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> handle 10</span> is formed of plastic and has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> shank 14</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> round head 11</span> embedded at the end thereof and bent slightly at 16 to have the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> blade assembly 12</span> extend slightly to an angle from the handle and to position it for more convenient use in performing the chores for which this cutter is adapted.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> round head 11</span> is of full circular formation providing for a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> groove 17</span> that extends fully about the head and lying beneath the top of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> head 11</span> between the top of the head and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> drop flange 18</span>. This round head has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> central opening 19</span> concentric with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> groove 17</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> flange 18</span>. This<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> opening 19</span> accommodates parts of the removable -blade assembly when attached to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> head 11</span> as will be apparent with further description.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The removable blade assembly comprises an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> outer curved plate 21</span> having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> projection 22</span> struck upwardly from the concave face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> plate 21</span> and in which at the root of the same, there is provided a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> slot 23</span> for accommodating a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> tong 24</span> of an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> attaching plate 26</span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> blade 27</span> having the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> usual slot 28</span> is placed upon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> outer plate 21</span> so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> projection 22</span> extends upwardly through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> slot 28</span> of the blade. The blade is bendable and can conform to the contour of the concave face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> plate 21</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> attaching plate 26</span> is of the same contour as the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> plate 21</span> so that its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> concave face 29</span> will force the blade downwardly,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> opening 31</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> attaching plate 26</span> will receive the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> projection 22</span> and as the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> attaching plate 26</span> is slide upwardly to slide the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> tong 24</span> through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> slot 23</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> upstanding projection 22</span> the attaching plate will secure the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> blade 27</span> in place between the two parts.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> Edge 32</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> slot 31</span> will abut the face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> projection 22</span> to conclude the assembly of the parts together and to ensure a good grip of the blade with the part.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   While this function is being effected the thumb and fingers are protected by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> upward<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">ly extending flanges 33 and 34</span></span> lying opposite sides of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> plate 21</span> and over the ends of the blade.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> One blade edge 36</span> will overlie a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37"> recess cutaway portion 37</span> in the forward edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> plate 21</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> other edge 38</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> blade 27</span> will protrude from the other edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> slot 31</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> plate 21</span> as best seen in FIGS. 1 and 2.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> assembly 12</span> is adapted to be placed upon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> round head 11</span> and can be turned to any desired position thereon. When the corns and callouses are being cut the assembly is ad justed to locate the blade edges so that they extend transversely of the handle and when the nails are to be cut the assembly will be adjusted so that the blade and edges extend longitudinally of the handle. For effecting the connection of the assembly with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> round head 11</span> on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> handle 10</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> inner or blade retaining plate 26</span> has its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> opposi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">te sides 41 and 42</span></span> folded inwardly and the cutaway respectively at 43 and 44 to receive the round head and locate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43"> edges <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">43 and 44</span></span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> groove 17</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43"> edges <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">43 and 44</span></span> are rounded to accommodate the contour of the groove but are open at their rear ends to pass the diameter distance of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> groove 17</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43"> side e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">dges 43 and 44</span></span> have<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> notche<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">s 46 and 47</span></span> to accommodate and r<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">eceive diametrically opposite projections 48</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> groove 17</span> as best seen in FIG. 3 so as to hold the blade assembly against rotation when disposed upon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> round head 11</span> as shown in P10. 3. Another pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem49"> diametrically opposite projections 49</span> are disposed in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> groove 17</span> 90 apart from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> projections 48</span> to hold the blade assembly by the location of this pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem49"> projections 49</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> notche<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">s 46 and 47</span></span> as shown in FIG. 3 and so that the blade edges run longitudinally of the handle.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   it should be apparent that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> blade assembly 12</span> can be adjusted upon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> round head 11</span> through 360 to expose the blade edges either from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> recess 27</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> plate 21</span> or upon its projected end from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39"> die edge 39</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> plate 21</span> for the selected cutting purposes for which the blade is to be used.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It should be readily understood that the blade assembly can be easily snapped on to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> head 11</span> of the handle, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> inturn<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">ed ends 41 and 42</span></span> biasing sufficiently to make the connection. The removal of the blade assembly from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> handle head 11</span> does not release the blade and it is kept intact between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> two pl<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">ates 21 and 26</span></span> until these plates are disassembled to remove the blade.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> handle 10</span> is an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51"> elongated opening 51</span> for accommodating the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> liquid-treating device 13</span> when it is not in use. This<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> liquid-treating device 13</span> comprises an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> elongated stick container 52</span> having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53"> dispensing opening 53</span> in which there is disposed a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> roller 54</span> that can be rolled over the skin to extract the liquid from the container and transfer it to the skin. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> roller 54</span> is retained against inward displacement by an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55"> upturned backing strip 55</span> secured to one side of the retainer, on the other end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> container 52</span> is an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> enlargement 56</span> which is open and from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57"> which protrudes brush bristles 57</span> which can be used to further distribute the liquid transferred by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> roller 54</span> over the skin.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In order to keep the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57"> brush bristles 57</span> from being exposed when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> liquid container 52</span> is thrust into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51"> opening 51</span> in the handle a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> partial cover member 58</span> of U-shape is pivotally connected by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59"> pivot <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">pins 59 and 61</span></sp<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">an> extending into openings 62</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> enlargement 56</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> container 52</span> so that when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> liquid-treating device 13</span> is removed from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51"> handle opening 51</span> it can be pivoted from the bristles to the position shown in FIG. 5. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> U-shaped cover member 58</span> has on the inner fac<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem63">es ofth<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">e leg portions thereof projections 63 and 64</span></span> which will re gister with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem65"> depressions 65</span> on the sides of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> container enlargement 56</span> to hold the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> partial cover 58</span> either in the position shown in FIG. or in its elongated positions as shown in FIG, 6 when<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> should<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem67">ers 66 and 67</span></span> will overlie the end face of the enlargement S6.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51"> handle opening 51</span> is slotted across the same and its outer end as shown at 68 to accommodate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> enlargement 56</span> with its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> partial cover 58</span> wheh the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> liquid-treating device 13</span> is slid home into its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51"> opening 51</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem63"> projection 63</span> will lie in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem69"> side openings 69</span> to hold the control device against axial outward displacement from the handle without force. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71"> shoulder 71</span> will at this time register with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> end face 72</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> handle slot 68</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73"> ends 7<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">3 and 74</span></span> of the leg portions of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> partial cover member 58</span> to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> respec<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem77">tively abut shoulders 76 and 77</span></span> on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> handle 10</span>. Thus it can be seen that there can also be stored in the handle the liquid-treating container bearing a brush which will be fully protected when disposed in the container. It will also be apparent that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> partial cover 58</span> can be lowered back to the positions shown in FIG. 5 when the liquidtreating device is to be put to use.   </p>
