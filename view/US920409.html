                        <p>  Application filed November 21, 1908. Serial No. 463,921.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, RUDoLF WILD, a subject of the Emperor of Germany, residing at Los Angelcs, in the county of Los Angelcs and State of California, haveinvented certain new and useful Improvements in Manicure Implements, of which the following is a specilication.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention relates to manicure implements of that kind characterized by a blade provided with a sharp edge for cutting and trimmin the nails. I   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The 0 ject of the present invention is to provide the implement with a novel form of cutting edge which enables the nails to be cut and trimmed without danger of cutting into the flesh, as well as to enable the implement to be held in either hand when in use.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The invention also has for its object to provide the blade with means for cleaning the nails, together with a guide therefor to facili tate the operation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   With these objects in view, the invention consists in a novel construction and arrangement ofparts to be hereinafter described and claimed, reference being had to the drawing hereto annexed, in which Figure 1 is an elevation of the implement.&#39; Fig. 2 is an enlarged section on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> line 22</span> of Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a similar View on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> line 33</span> of Fig. 1. I   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The invention is shown herein as one of the blades of an ordinary pocket knife,- the handle of which is indicated at 5 in the drawing, and said blade by the reference numeral 6. It is however to be understood, that the blade referred to may be mounted on some different kind of handle orsupport.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In one of the edges of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> blade 6</span>, near its outer end, I make a-pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> notches 7</span>, the walls of which are semicircularin form, and   </p>
                    
                        <p>  beveled on both sides, as clearly shown in Fig. 2, to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> form cutting edges 8</span> of the&#39;nailcutter portion of the implement. By beveling the notches on both sides, it will be seen that the&#39;implement may be held in either hand when in use, whereas, with a single bevel, it would not cut as readily when held in onehand as when held in the other hand, and the nail will also be cut squarely and smooth, and without leaving a sharp or rag ed edge.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The notches are located closely together, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> short portion 9</span> of the edge therebel tween, serves as a gage for the cutting edges. 1 When the cuttin edge of&#39;the forward notch is used, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> portlon 9</span> lies beneath the protruding end of the nail to be cut off, and thereby prevents said edge fromentering too deeply into the nail, and thus cutting the flesh under the same. By providing two cutting edges, the implement may also be used for cutting the toe-nails, the cutting edge of the-rear notch being used for this purpose, in order to obtain the action of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> gage 9</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   he back edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> blade 6</span> terminates in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> concave portion 10</span> which meets the edge of the blade in which the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> notches 7</span> are made, to form a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> oint 11</span> which may be used to clean thenaiff or remove accumulations thereunder, the tip of the finger or toe being-received in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> concave edge portion 10</span>, which is rounded and smooth in order not to out into the tip.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   That portion of the edge of theblade in which the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> notches 7</span> are made, between the forward notch and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> point 11</span>, is convex and sharpened to form a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutting edge 12</span>, which may be used for scraping or trimming the nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It will be seen from the foregoing that I have provided a manicure implement which is sim le in structure so that it can be cheaply manu actured, and by providing the particular form and arrangement of cutting edges herein described, the implement is rendered safe, and can be easily operated, and it effectually serves the purpose for which it is designed. The cutting edges, by reason of their semicircular form, do not become easily dulled, and they remain sharp throughout a long period of use of the implement. I have shown the face of the blade plain, but, if desiredyit Ina be formed with a file surface.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The-note es extend at an acute angle with respect to thelongitudinal axis of the blade, which brings the cutting edges into a position to be used with greater facility and comfort; The back edge of the blade, up to the part 10, and the opposite edge, up to the notches, are rounded off as shown in Fig. 2 of the drawing, in order that they may be graspedwithout danger of the user being cut thereby.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  I claim:-   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1. A manicure implement comprising a blade having in one of its edges a pair of 5 limit the penetration of the cutting edges.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   4 2. A manicure implement comprising an elongated blade havin adj acent, to its outer end &#39;a pair of notches ocated in close pr0X- imity to each other, the walls of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> notches 10</span> being beveled to form cutting edges, and the body of the blade between the notches-form.-   </p>
                    
                        <p>  ing a gage to limit the penetration of the cut.- ting ed essafid said notched edge of the blade being iunt&#39; from its butt-end up to the&#34; notches, v In testimony whereof I affix my signature 1n presence of two witnesses.   </p>
