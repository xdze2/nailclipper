                        <p>  T 0 all whom it may concern i Be it known that I, JOHN OLIN .LANDIS, a citizen ofthe&#39;United States, and a resident of VVaynesboro, in the county of Frankp Y issubjected to the action of suitable dies to lin and State of Pennsylvania, have &#39;invented a newand Improved Manicure Implement, of which the following is a full, clear, and exact description.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The present invention relates to new and ments and pertains more particularlyto small, tools especially adapted for trimming nails. c   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The object of the present invention is to provide a device of this character which in its-initial manufacture is both simpleand cheap;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A further object of the invention is to provide a device of this character in which the cutting edge may from&#39;time to time be renewed.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   lVith the above and other objects in view, reference is hadtothe accompanying draw i 1&#39;) gs, in wh<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">ich i 25 Figure 1 is a top plan</span> view of a de<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">vice constr</span>ucted. in&#39;accordance withthe present invention; v I   </p>

                        <p>   Referring more particularly&#39;to the drawings, the reference characterb designates a metalfiplate, the center of which is pro ,vidod with an opening 6, which in the pres-&#39; ent instanc<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">e. is &#34</span>;shown as. round .bUf/WhlCh &#34;may be made in any desired form or the sau&#39;ie may be omitted without affecting the scope of the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The reference character &#39;7 designates an annular flange formed on themarginal edge of the plate 5, and as best seen in Fig. 3,   </p>
