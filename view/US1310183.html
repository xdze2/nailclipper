                        <p>  To all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, CALYX FONTAINE, a citizen of the United States, residing at Boston, in the county of Suifolk and State of Massachusetts, have invented new and useful Improvements in Corn and Bunion Scorers, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention relates to an implement for forming shallow scoring cuts in the surface of a corn or a bunion on a human foot, preparatory to the application of a liquid chemical solution which enters the cuts and eradicates the excrescence.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The invention is embodied in the improvements which I will now proceed to describe and claim.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Of the accompanying drawings forming a part of this specification,   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 1 is an enlarged side view of a scoring implement embodying the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Fig. 2 is a section on line 2-2 of Fig. 1.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 3 is a view similar to a portion of Fig. 2, showing a different adjustment.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 4 is a longitudinal section of the knife, the shank, and the sleeve shown by Fig. 2.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 5 is a longitudinal section of the sheath shown by Fig. 2.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The same reference characters indicate the same parts in all of the figures.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the drawings, 12 represents a narrow elongated blade sharpened at its outer end to form a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> transverse cutting or scoring edge 13</span>. 14 represents a shank which may be a cylindrical wooden pin slotted to receive the inner end portion of the blade and secured thereto by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pin or rivet 18</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   15 represents a sheet metal sleeve having an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> internal screw thread 16</span> and an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> apertured head 17</span>. A swivel connection between the sleeve and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> shank 14</span> is provided by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> screw 19</span> entering the shank and passing through the aperture in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> head 17</span>, the screw having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> head 19</span> bearing on the outer side of the head. The sleeve is therefore rotatable on the screw.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   21 represents a tubular sheet metal sheath having at its inner end an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> external screw thread 22</span> engaging the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> internal thread 16</span>. The outer end portion of the sheath is flattened at opposite sides to form a fiatsided Specification of Letters Patent.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Serial No. 263,529.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">   </p>
                    
                        <p>  open guide 23</span>, in which the outer end portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> blade 12</span> has a sliding fit.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The described parts when separated, as shown by Figs. 5 and 6, are assembled by inserting the blade and shank into the sheath. The outer end of the blade partially enters the guide, as indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 6, before the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> screw thread 22</span> engages the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> screw thread 16</span>, so that the blade and shank are prevented from rotating when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> sleeve 15</span> is rotated. The threaded end portion of the sheath is now drawn into the threaded portion of the sleeve by the rotation of the latter, the arrangement being such that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> cutting edge 13</span> may project from the guide, as shown by Figs. 1 and 2, or may be located within the guide, as shown by Fig. 3.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The outer end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> guide 23</span> constitutes a shoulder or guard surrounding the blade near its cutting edge, when the parts are adjusted as shown by Figs. 1 and 2, and limiting the depth of a scoring cut formed by said cutting edge.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The described implement which in prac tice is preferably about one-half of the size represented, is adapted to be conveniently grasped and manipulated to form scoring cuts in a corn, bunion, or other excrescence, the depth of the out being regulable.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> shank 14</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> screw 19</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> headed internally threaded sleeve 15</span>, and the threaded portion of the sheath, constitute a suitable embodiment of means for relatively Patented July 15, 1919..   </p>
                    
                        <p>  moving the blade and sheath to locate the cutting edge either outside of or within the guard. I do not limit myself, however, to this particular embodiment, and may provide any other suitable means for effecting said relative movement.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As shown by Fig. 1, the end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> guide 23</span> which constitutes the acting portion of the guard, is parallel with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> cutting edge 13</span>. I prefer to slightly curve the cutting edge and the end of the guide as shown.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  I claim:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A corn and bunion scorer comprising a narrow elongated blade having a transverse cutting edge at its outer end, a shank attached to the inner end portion of the blade, an internally threaded sleeve having an apertured head at one end, a swivel connection between said head and the knife shank,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  and a tubular sheath externally threaded at the knife edge, the outer end of the guide its inner end portion to engage the internal constituting a guard limiting the depth of thread of the sleeve, and having a fiat-sided a scoring out made by said edge. 1 open guide at its outer end .in Which the In testimony whereof I have affixed my.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  5 outer end portion of the blade has a sliding signature.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  fit, said sheath being longitudinally movable by rotation of the sleeve to cover and expose CALYX FONTAINE.   </p>
