                        <p>  SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 766,859, dated August 9, 1904. Application filed October 20, 1903. Serial No. 177,75I. (N model.)   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it nmiy cone/37 1i:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, HENEY ILcoX, a citizen of the United States, residing at 74 Monmouth street, Newark, county of Essex, State of New Jersey, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in lVIanicure-Qloole, fully described and represented in the following specificationand the accompanying drawings, forming a part of the same.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The object of the present invention is to facilitate the manufacture and improve the construction of that class of nail-clippers in which two levers are pivoted near one end and provided at such end with the jaws for clipping the finger-nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the present invention a nail-cleaner is pivoted upon the rear cnd&#39;oi&#39; the upper lever and furnished with stops to hold it in its open and closed positions and with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> hook which 20</span>. projects at its rear end when in its closed position to engage a recurved spring attached to the lower lever. l/Vhen the nail-cleaner is closed, the hook can be engaged with the spring by merely pressing the levers together,   </p>
                    
                        <p>   which looks themin an inoperative position for carrying in the pocket. The nail-cleaner serves as a handle to detach the hook from the end of the spring when it is desired to open the levers and operate the clipper.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   0 I The invention includes a stop for the cleaner when shut, a stop for the cleaner when open, a particular construction for the spring and for securing the same upon the lower lever, and a particular arrangement of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> spring 3</span> 5 for closing the opening in the frame of the rear lever to form a bearing-seat for the fingers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the annexed drawings, Figure 1 isaside elevation of the clipper entirely opened in 4 readiness for use. Fig. 2 a plan of the upper side of the same. Fig. 3 is an edge view of the clipper closed and the levers locked. Fig. &amp; is a plan of the upper side of the same, showing the nail-cleaner in its closed position. Fig. 5 shows the under side of the clipper when locked. Fig. 6 shows the lower lover of the clipper separated. from the other parts, and Fig. 7 shows the upper side of the spring which is secured upon such lever.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Fig. 8 is a longitudinal section of the spring. 5 Fig. 9 is a transverse section on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> line 9</span> 9 in Fig. 8, and F ig. 10 is a longitudinal section oi. the upper lever looking toward the edge which clears the hook on&#39; the nail-cleaner.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Each of the levers is made of one piece of sheet metal stamped to the desired form, the upper lever having a plate at extending its whole length, with the jaw (z bent upwardly at one end and.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> side flanges 7</span>) also bent upwardly and provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> lugs 6</span>, having 6 pivot holes 0 for the hinge-rivet (Z. The flanges I) are formed with notch c in their edges adjacent to the lugs for the purpose hereinafter described. One of the side flanges b is formed with a notch c for apurpose to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> be 5</span> described. The lower lever is likewise stamped of sheet metahwith downwardly-bent flanges i, the upper plate of the lever being wholly cut away by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> slot 7</span>&#39; to permit the insertion and movement of the upper lever, excepting a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> cross-piece 7</span>: at the rear end of the lever to hold the side flanges together, and at the front end where provided with the cutting-jaw and with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">jaw-plate (1</span>/, which is extended a little back of the hinge-pin (Z.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  . The nail-cleaner fis formed as a two-armed lever pivoted by a rivet g to turn horizontally upon the top of the upper lever and has the pointed end (which serves as a nail-cleaner) of greater length than the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> opposite end or 30</span> tailpiece, which is bent downward at the end, and the projection provided at its extremity with a catch formed as an upwardly-turned catch-hook /1.. The projection with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> catch-hook 72</span> is adapted to enter the notch a and is made of 8 5 suitable width to strike the opposite unperforated flange b, which serves as a stop to hold the nail-cleaner extended, as shown in Figs.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  1 and 2.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The flange having the notch a is provided &#39;9 adjacent to the pivot-holes c with an upwardlyprojccting stud ti, which serves as a stop to set the nail-cleaner parallel with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> body 01</span>&#39; the upper lever when turned inwardly, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4E.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The extension of the plate a backwardly from the jaw is to form a stop for the opening movement of the levers, which is eflected in pressing the levers together.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  by the contact of such plate with the bottoms of the notches 0 upon the flanges b, as shown in Fig. 1.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The lever is also provided with holes for the hinge-pin (Z, and the usual spring [is wound upon the pin and its ends extended against the plates of the upper and lower jaws to hold the levers separated, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 6.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The lower flanges z&#39; are formed with ears on to receive a cross-pin 9t, and a spring-plate 0 is formed to lie upon the lower edges of the flanges t&#39; and provided with notches p in the edges to embrace the ears m.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The spring-plate 0 is provided with a transverse indentation q to lie beneath the pin a and is bent to press normally upward against the edges of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> flanges 2</span>&#39;. The spring thus lies on the outside of the lower lever and covers the open space between the flanges and serves to form a seat to support the fingers The rear end 0 of the spring is recurved and bent downwardly and formed with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> shallow notch 19</span>&#39; to engage the hook 7L upon the tailpiece of the nail-cleaner, which hook is made narrower than the body of the nail-cleaner, as shown in Fig. 2, to contact with one of theflanges b of the upper lever in forming a stop for the opened cleaner.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   When the nail-cleaner is turned inwardly, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the jaws may be pressed together and the hook it snapped beneath the recurved end 0 of the spring 0, where it engages the notch p. The notch holds the cleaner from any involuntary movement or turning upon its pivot, but does not prevent the moving of the nail-cleaner around its pivot by the use of a little force when it is desired to open the nail-cleaner for using the clipper, as shown in Fig. 1. WVhen thus moved, the hook l2. crowds the curved end 0 of its engaging spring upwardly enough to move past the same. When thus turned, one finger can be laid upon the top of the nailcleaner and the other upon the body of the spring 0, which serves as a seat or thumbpiece for the finger when pressing the levers together for using the clipper in the ordinary manner.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The parts for my nail-clipper canbe cheaply made by suitable tools, and the device itself is convenient and practicable for operation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having thus set forth the nature of the invention, what is claimed herein is 1.
