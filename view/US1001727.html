                        <p>  Application filed May 6, 1909.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Patented&#39;Aug. 29, 1911. Serial No. 494,428.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  T 0 all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, l/VILLIAM GI-IALMEns BAIRD, citizen of the United States, residing at Colorado Springs, in the county of El Paso and State of Colorado, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Manicuring Implements, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention relates to improvements in combination tools adapted for manicuring or other purposes and has for its object to provide an article of this nature comprising a cork screw and a nail trimming device.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   With the above and other objects in view the invention consists in certain novel constructions, combinations and arrangements of parts, clearly illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which,   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 1 is a longitudinal sectional view. Fig. 2 is a perspective view of a modified form. Fig. 3 is a transverse sectional view of Fig. 1 showing the cigar cutter arrangement. Fig. 4 is a transverse sectional view taken on line D-E of Fig. 2. Fig. 5 is a transverse sectional view taken on line A--B of Fig. 2. Fig. 6 is a detail plan View of one clipper plate. Fig. 7 is a detail plan view of the other clipper plate, and Fig. 8 is a detail view of the cigar cutter blades of the modified device shown in Fig. 2.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring to the accompanying drawings which are prepared for illustrative purposes and are accordingly not drawn to scale, 1 denotes the bottom clipper plate and 2 the upper clipper plate. The bottom clipper plate is formed with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> enlarged inner portion 8</span>, which is provided with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> arc-shaped slot 4</span> which slot narrows as it approaches the end of said plate, and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> rounded recess 5</span> adapted to receive one half of a cigar end. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> upper plate 2</span> is formed with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> enlarged inner portion 6</span>, and is provided with an arc-shaped slot, having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> recess 8</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> rounded recess 9</span> opposing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> rounded recess 5</span>, and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> longitudinally extending recess 10</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> portio<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">ns 3 and 6</span></span> are formed with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> rounde<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">d tapering recesses 5 and 9</span></span> and the adjacent ends of the portions terminate in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> cutting edges 1</span>&#34; and 2*, formed integral with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> plates<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> 1 and 2</span></span>. The forward ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> plates<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> 1 and 2</span></span> are curved inwardly to fit the tips of a finger, and the rear ends are provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> regist<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ering openings 11 and 12</span></span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> opening 12</span> in the upper plate being formed oval.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> plates<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> 1 and 2</span></span> are connected together by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> shaft 13</span>, one end of which is formed with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> rivet head 14</span>, and the other end of which is formed with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> screw threads 15</span>, said ends being narrower than the middle body portion of the shaft. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> shaft 13</span> carries a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cork screw 16</span>, formed integral therewith, the point of which resiliently engages at 17 the rear portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> enlarged face 6</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> plate 2</span>, so as to hold the forward end of said plate away from the forward end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> plate 1</span>, thereby keeping the device open.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lever 18</span>, having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> cam offset arm 19</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> fulcrum head 20</span>, and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> beveled rear end 21</span>, is pivoted at 22 between the walls of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> slot 7</span>, so that the head moves in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> recess 8</span> of said slot and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> cam arm 19</span> projects into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> slots 7</span>. By manipulating the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lever 18</span> the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> cam arm 19</span> is forced against the forward wall of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> slot 4</span>, thereby closing the clipping jaws of the plates, which jaws are formed with cutting edges. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lever 18</span> is also provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> file 18</span> The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> beveled end 21</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lever 18</span> engages the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> rivet head 14</span>, which is adapted to move on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> plate 2</span> so that said rivet head will be readily pushed aside so as to allow for the location of the beveled end thereunder. By turning the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cork screw 16</span> the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> screw 15</span> will be forced into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> opening 11</span> whereby the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> plates<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> 1 and 2</span></span> are rigidly locked together so as to form a handle therefor and the cork screw is brought into position to be used for pulling corks.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the modification shown in Figs. 2 and 4, one side of each plate is formed with a recess and in each recess of the plates, which are located in registering positions thereon, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> cigar cutter knife 23</span> is secured by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> screw 24</span>. Each knife is formed with a reduced face so that the two readily engage with each other. By bringing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> plates<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> 1 and 2</span></span> together the cutter knives are brought into engagement, so that when a cigar is inserted therebetween the same may be readily cut. The outer face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> plate 2</span> is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> nail file or match scratcher 25</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   I claim and desire to secure by Letters Patent:   </p>
