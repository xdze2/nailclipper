                        <p>  Patented Oct. 2, 1 951 FINGERNAIL CLIPPER George P. Davis, Durham, N. 0. Application December 6, 1948, Serial No. 63,829   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1 Claim. 1   </p>
                    
                        <p>  This invention relates to finger nail clippers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   An object of this invention is to provide an improved clipper embodying complementary blades with handles extending from the blades, and a spring carried by one of the handles engaging the other handle for constantly urging the blades to open position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object of this invention is to provide in a device of this kind, an improved means for locking the blades in closed position, the locking means also forming a file and overlyin one of the handles when in locked position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A further object of this invention is to provide a nail clipper which is of simple construction so that it can be made at relatively low cost.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   With the above and other objects in view, my invention consists in the arrangement, combination and details of construction disclosed in the drawing and specification, and then mor particularly pointed out in the appended claim.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In the drawing,   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure l is a plan view of a nail clipper or trimmer constructed according to an embodiment of my invention, showing the device in open operative position,   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 2 is a sectional view taken on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> line 22</span> of Figure 1,   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 3 is a detail side elevation partly broken away and in section, of the device in closed position,   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 4 is a sectional view taken on the line 4-4 of Figure 2.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring to the drawing, the numerals I I] and II designate generally a pair of complementary clipper blades. The blade III comprises the stationery blade and is carried by a pair of rearwardly extending elongated bars I2 which are disposed in spaced apart parallel relation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The blade I I which is pivotally mounted on a pivot member I3 extending between the two bars I2, has extending rearwardly therefrom an in tegral longitudinally bowed handle or lever I4. The two bars I2 adjacent the rear thereof are connected together by means of a connecting plate I5 which has fixed to the lower side thereof the rear end of a longitudinally bowed spring I6. A rivet or other fastening means II secures the rear end of the spring I6 to the plate I5. The handle or lever I4 tapers in thickness from the forward to the rear end thereof and forms a shoulder I8 closely adjacent the pivot I3 and the free or forward end of the spring I6 is adapted when the device is in closed inoperative position to engage in the space formed by the shoulder I8.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The two bars I2 have pivotally secured thereto a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> file I 9</span> and the rear ends of the bars I2 are each formed with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> ear 20</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> file I 9</span> is also formed with a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> right angularly disposed ears 2</span>| and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> pivot pin 22</span> extends through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> ears 2<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">0 and 2</span></span>| so as to pivotally secure the file I9 to the rear ends of the bars I2. When the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> handle or lever I 4</span> is in inoperative position, this lever is adapted to engage between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> ears 2</span>!] and to overlie the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> pivot pin 22</span>, as shown in Figure 3. At this time the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> file I 9</span> is swung forwardly to overlying position so that the rear portion of the file I9 will form a locking means for locking the lever I4 in inoperative position with the two blades I0 and II in closed or contacting position. In order to open the clippers, the file I9 is swung upwardly and rearwardly to the position shown in Figure 2, thereby releasing the lever I4 which is swung upwardly to open position by means of the spring I6.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This clipper being of relatively simple construction will not readly get out of order and the locking means for the pivoted blade and handle will not become damaged or broken as is the case with clippers of present construction which require the lateral shifting of the lever for engagement with a fixed keeper or lock.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   I do not mean to confine myself to the exact details of construction herein disclosed, but claim all variations fallin within the purview of the appended claim.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  What I claim is:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A nail clipper comprising an open bottomed channel shaped member having a clipper blade extending therefrom, a second member including an oppositely disposed clipper blade pivotally connected between the sides of said channel shaped member at a point adjacent said first mentioned clipper blade; a connecting plate between the sides of said first mention-ed member at the end thereof opposite the blade, a leaf spring secured to the underside of said plate extending upwardly between the sides of said channel shaped member and having one end projecting beyond said plate, a right angled shoulder on the under side of said second member adapted to abut the other end of said spring, an extending plate of a length substantially equal to said channel shaped member having apertured lugs with rounded extremities on one end thereof, a pivot pin extending through the apertures in said lugs and the ends of the side walls of said channel shaped member outwardly of said first mentioned member pivotally connecting said last mentioned plate thereto, said end of said spring when said last mentioned plate overlies said channel shaped member abutting said pivot pin, whereby the bias Of said end or The following references are of record in the file of this patent:   </p>
