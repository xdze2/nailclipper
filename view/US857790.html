                        <p>  To all whom, it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Be it known that I, WALTER J. CARROLL, a   </p>
                    
                        <p>  &#39; citizen of the United States, residing at Detroit, county of Wayne, State of Michigan, have invented a certain new and useful Improvement in Manicure Implements, of which the following is a specification, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, which form a part of this specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My invention has for its object certain new and useful improvements in a manicure implement, the same being designed more particularly to provide an instrument of this class especially adapted for cutting toe nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My present invention consists of the novel construction, combination and arrangement of devices hereinafter described and claimed and illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which,   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 1 is a view in side elevation. Fig. 2 is a view in side elevation taken at right angles to that shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a view in vertical section on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> line 33</span>, Fig. 2, showing parts in elevation. Fig. 4 is a view of the fixed cutter blade. Fig. 5 is a view of the movable cutter blade. Fig. 6 is a view in section on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> line 66</span>, Fig. 1.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The aim of this invention is to construct an instrument for the purpose specified which will be efficient in operation and economical in its manufacture.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  I carry out my invention as follows:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the drawings 0 represents a foot or supporting member secured upon the lower end of a tubular casing b, said foot being provided on its under side with an elongated kerf or recess d in which is secured a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> fixed cutter blade 6</span> and a movable cutter blade f, the movable cutter blade being, preferably, the lower cutter blade. The movable cutter blade f is shown pivotally engaged in the foot as bya pin or screw g, the same being provided with an are shaped slot 0 at its inner and upper end, as shown in Figs. 3 and 5. The fixed cutter blade e may also be mounted upon said pin or screw g, an additional pin it being passed through its inner end to hold the blade in fixed position. I prefer that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> screw 9</span> shall be provided with a countersunk lock nut i. It will be apparent that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> cutter blades 6</span> and f form a pair of shears. The cutter blades are preferably .constructed with straight cutting edges. A plunger or&#39;push rod jis made reciprocatory in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> tubular casing 1</span>), said push rod being engaged with the movable cutter blade as by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> pin 7</span>.? engaged in the slot 0. Upon the upper end of the push rod is a cap Z, a collar m beneath the head being shown sleeved upon the upper end of the casing, and having a limited reciprocation thereupon. Within the upper end of the casing I also locate a bushing n engaged upon the push rod, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> spring 19</span> resting upon one end thereof, said spring engaged to exert its tension upon the push rod to hold it in normal position, i. 6., in position to open the movable cutter blade. The lower end of the push rod is preferably formed with a shoulder r, as shown in Fig. 6, so that the adjacent upper edge .of the movable cutter blade will bear upon said shoulder. This arrangement will, obviously, relieve the strain upon the movable cutter blade from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> pin 76</span>, the strain being upon said shoulder in operation. The push rod is further provided with a collar s, the push rod being also recessed preferably above the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> collar 8</span> as indicated at t. Upon the exterior of the casing I) is engaged a sleeve it upon which is fulcrumed as at c an operating lever w preferably constructed with a ring 00 to receive a finger of the operator, and with a protecting lever arm y under which another finger of the operator may be engaged. The sleeve is also provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> fixed arm 2</span> under which still another finger of the operator may be engaged.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It will be evident that the cutting away of the push rod as at 13 forms a shoulder therebeneath upon which the inner end of the lever to is engaged. It will also be obvious that the operator, grasping the lever w and arms y and 2, the palm of the hand resting upon the head or cap Z, by the act of closing his fingers toward the palm, will lift the outer end of the lever w thereby depressing the plunger which,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  in turn, bearing upon the heel of the movable cutter blade, will actuate said blade closing its cutting edge against the cutting edge of the fixed blade. By releasing pressure upon the lever w, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> spring 1</span>) restores the plunger and the movable cutter blade to normal position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the slot or recess (Z of the foot a I also fulcrum a knife blade&#39;indicated at 7 and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> file blade 8</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> Springs 9</span> exert their tension upon said blades in a customary manner.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It will be seen that the lever to is so shaped that it may readily be grasped by the second and third fingers of the hand, while the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> arm 2</span> may be engaged&#39;by the first finger.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To hold the movable blade in closed posiextending to the exterior of the case b, the inner end normally bearing against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> collar 8</span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> spring 11</span> holds said spindle normally disengaged from said collar. It will be evi dent that when the plunger is depressed, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> spindle 1</span>.0 may be forced inward over the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> collar 8</span> to hold the plunger from retraction, when it is desired to operate the device by a downward movement of the plunger, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> spindle 10</span> will be restored to normal position.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">   </p>
