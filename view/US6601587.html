                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A toenail clipper extension device is provided with nail clippers attached to an elongated main extension that enables the user to perform the clipping task from a number of positions, included the upright seated position. A pistol grip handle is on the near end of the device, with a trigger, cord and dual rollers on the extension that cause the nail clipper lever to be pulled when the trigger is pulled. The user is assisted by a mirror and mirror extension arm assembly that provides 360 degree rotational and pivotal positioning of the mirror. Double ball joints are provided in this regard at the joinder of the mirror to the mirror extension arm, and the joinder of the mirror extension arm to the device main extension. The roller closest to the nail clipper assembly is specially sized and positioned within a compartmental enlargement of the main extension, such that the cord approaches the nail clipper lever at an acute angle in the static position. As the cord pulls the lever, the approach angle moves toward ninety degrees, thus providing an optimal approach angle for working the nail clipper lever. </p>

                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates generally to nail clippers and, more specifically, to a trigger-activated extension device for toenail clippers which would enable overweight and other physically impaired people to cut their own toenails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Description of the Prior Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Numerous types of nail clippers have been provided in the prior art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,449 issued to George K. C. Lee, et al. on Dec. 4, 1979 is illustrative of such prior art as is U.S. Pat. No. 4,564,034 issued on Jan. 14, 1986 Nathaniel T. Mackel. Sam Dunn Jr. was issued U.S. Pat. No. 4,846,994 on Jul. 18, 1989 and another patent was issued on Sep. 18, 1990 as U.S. Pat. No. 4,956,915 to Charles A. Anderson and yet another patent was issued to Justin w. West on Oct. 25, 1994 as U.S. Pat. 5,357,677. Still another patent was issued to David Rains as U.S. Pat. No. 5,775,340 on Jul. 7, 1998 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,926,956 was issued to Kirk Langmen et al. on Jul. 27, 1999. While these nail clippers may be suitable for the particular purpose to which they address, they would not be as suitable for the purposes of the present invention as heretofore described. While these toenail clippers may be suitable for the purposes for which they were designed, they would not be as suitable for the purposes of the present invention as heretofore described. It is thus desirable to provide a toenail clipper extension device having a trigger activated clipper assembly mounted on an extension rod which would allow physically restricted users to clip their own toenails without the assistance of others. An adjustable mirror assembly extending from the distal clipper end of the extension rod provides an alternate view of the clipper assembly to assist the user in accurately placing the clipper jaws on opposing sides of the toenail to be trimmed.  </p>

                        <p>      Inventor: George K. C. Lee et al.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Issued: Dec. 4, 1979  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This original invention, the GRIP-OPERATED NAIL CLIPPER, is a device improving the common (Finger-Operated) Toe-and-Finger Nail Clipper. The invention is the solution to the problem that less dexterous children, aged people, and arthritic and otherwise handicapped people have in manipulating and working the common finger-operated nail clipper. Its simple lever-clamp-like action puts the focus of grip-pressure closer and over the nail to be clipped making it easy to control, and the grip action of all five fingers and the palm is much stronger than the normal two-finger common nail clipper. Furthermore, the leverage is increased thus reducing considerably the force necessary to nip the nails clean. Unlike plier-like and other modes of nail clipper where the operating handgrip is opposite the fulcrum hinge and away from the nail being clipped, this invention device works in the direction toward the nail.  </p>

                        <p>      A holder permits a conventional nail clipper to be operated with only a downward press.of one finger or one toe, with the hand or foot having the nail to be cut resting on a common surface with the holder; a toenail can be cut without need to sit or to bend over if such would help a sufferer with arthritis or would speed up the nail cutting process, the clipper butt end instantly slips into a socket in the block-like base of the holder, and is as quickly removed; a portion of the clipper with the jaws protrudes upwardly and forwardly beyond the holder and the socket has an incline downwardly toward the rear that tips the jaws upward for safe visibility and for increasing the securance of the clipper in the socket under pressure of nail cutting.  </p>

                        <p>      A remotely actuated toenail clipper includes a cylindrical tubular housing which encloses an axially reciprocating plunger rod. A leaf spring type toenail clipper extends through a slot in a bottom portion of the housing. An actuating lever of the toenail clipper is in engagement with the plunger rod. A scissor mechanism extends transversely through a slot in an upper portion of the housing for actuating the plunger rod. The device is particularly designed for use by individuals who have difficulty reaching their toenails with conventional forms of nail clippers. In a second embodiment, the axially movable plunger rod is electrically actuated by a solenoid mechanism. An adjustable telescope is mounted in parallel relation to the cylindrical housing and provides an individual with a clear view of the toenail clipper.  </p>

                        <p>      A combined toe and finger nail clipper having a common metal strip with a toe nail cutting edge at one end and a finger nail cutting edge at the opposite end. Mating nail cutting edges are at the ends of two additional metal strips which are each welded above and below at opposite ends of the common metal strip. A pair of vertical retaining posts located at each end of the nail clipping unit bold lever arms which can be stored in the flat position or rotated around and put into the use position as in conventional nail clippers. In this way a manufacturer can produce a combined toe and finger nail clipper more economically than two separate nail clippers and the user can store the combined nail clipper in a smaller space without worrying about locating two separate clippers. The clipper can be constructed so that while one of the clippers is in use the cutting edges of its other are closed or only slightly open so as to avoid the comers of the cutting edges catching or scratching a finger of the user.  </p>

                        <p>      Still another object of the present invention is to provide a toenail clipper extension device including an adjustable mirror assembly extending from the distal clipper end of the extension rod wherein said mirror assembly may be pre-positioned by the user to provide a preferred view of the interaction between the clipper assembly and the toenail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a toenail clipper extension device wherein the mirror assembly includes a magnifying mirror glass to provide the user with a more detailed view of the clipper assembly&#39;s interaction with the toenail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a toenail clipper extension device wherein the mirror assembly includes an illumination means to increase the visibility of the clipper assembly and toenail area whether viewing directly or in the mirror.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A further object of the present invention is to provide a toenail clipper extension device wherein the lever and roller system delivers a greater degree of force to the lever of the clipper assembly than the user must exert upon the trigger therefore making the present invention easy to use and indispensable to those with weak or arthritic hands.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A still further object of the present invention is to provide a toenail clipper extension device wherein the trigger assembly is accompanied by a pistol grip handle to increase the ease of controlling the positioning of the present invention particularly during the substantially vertical placement of the clipper assembly to the toe area.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A yet further object of the present invention is to provide a toenail clipper extension device wherein the mirror assembly comprises a mirror plate pivotably and rotatably connected to a mirror extension shaft by means of a ball joint assembly with another ball joint assembly connecting the mirror assembly to t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem360">he main extension rod thereby providing  360</span>  degree axial rotation of the mirror assembly to the distal end of the main extension rod and the clipper assembly.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Still another object of the present invention is to provide a toenail clipper extension device that is simple and easy to use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Yet another object of the present invention is provide a toenail clipper extension device that is economical in cost to manufacture.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Additional objects of the present invention will appear as the description proceeds.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention comprises an extension rod having a first end-with toenail clippers fastened thereto at a right angle and a second end having a pistol grip and trigger mechanism attached thereon with a cord and roller system communicating therebetween. A magnifying mirror assembly located on the distal clipper end is provided to increase visibility of the toenails to be trimmed and the clipper assembly. An operator uses his or her direct line of sight and/or the view presented by the angle of the mirror as positioned by the operator to assure accurate placement of the toenail clippers relative to the toenail to be trimmed. The user then pulls the trigger mechanism, which influences the cord and roller system and depresses the lever of the clipper assembly resulting in the closing of the jaws of said clipper assembly, thereby effectively clipping the toenail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The trimming of one&#39;s own toenails can be difficult or impossible for people who are obese, recently out of surgery, or have any other physical impairment that restricts movement. People in such cases often rely on family, friends or health care workers to perform such tasks. This dependency often results in a lack of self-esteem because of the additional burden that they feel is being placed upon others or in the task being neglected and therefore resulting in the growth of uncomfortably long toenails which could lead to further health problems including broken toenails, infection, fungus, etc. The present invention provides a toenail clipper extension device that will enable a user with restricted movement to comfortably clip his or her own toenails without the reliance of others thereby resulting in better self-esteem and hygiene.  </p>

                        <p>      Turning now descriptively to the drawings, in which similar reference characters denote similar elements throughout the several views, FIGS. 1-6 illustrate the toenail clipper extension device of the present invention indicated generally by the numeral  10 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">device  10</span>  is depicted to various extents in FIGS. 1-6, and in use in FIG.  1 . As shown in FIG. 1, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">device  10</span>  is held by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">user  12</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">hand  14</span>  and appropriately positioned with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">user&#39;s toe  16</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As shown in FIGS. 2-3 and  6 , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">nail clipper assembly  18</span>  has <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">two spr<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">ing members  20 , 22</span></span>  that are joined together at one end, and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">each sp<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">ring member  20 , 22</span></span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">cutting<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> jaw  24 , 26</span></span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lever  28</span>  is provided, and when moved the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lever  28</span>  forces the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">cutting<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> jaws  24 , 26</span></span>  together, thus cutting the toenail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      An elongated body in the form of an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">extension shaft  30</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">first end  32</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second end  34</span> , as shown in FIGS. 2-3. To the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">first end  32</span>  is attached a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">pistol grip handle  36</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">nail clipper assembly  18</span>  is attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">extension shaft  30</span>  at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">extension shaft second end  34</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">extension shaft  30</span>  has an enlargement in the form of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">compartment  38</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Pivotably attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">extension shaft  30</span>  near the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">pistol grip handle  36</span>  is an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">actuating trigger mechanism  40</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">trigger mechanism  40</span>  is positioned for manipulation from a first to a second position by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">user  12</span>  gripping the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">pistol grip handle  38</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As shown in FIG. 3, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">first roller  42</span>  is positioned proximate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">trigger mechanism  40</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">second roller  44</span>  positioned proximate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">nail clipper assembly  18</span> , and further positioned substantially within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">compartment  38</span> . From a side view, and in the plane of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">rollers<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">  42 , 44</span></span>  and the movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">nail clipper assembly lever  28</span> , it is shown in FIG. 3, that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">second roller&#39;s  44</span>  size and lower position relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">first roller  42</span> , cause a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">cord  46</span>  to exit the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">second roller  44</span>  with an approach to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lever  28</span> , such that the angle formed by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">cord  46</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lever  28</span>  is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90"> less than 90</span> degrees. In fact, the angle is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90"> approaching 90</span> degrees, thus optimizing the ability of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">cord  46</span>  to move the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lever  28</span> . Furthermore, as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lever  28</span>  moves the angle changes toward the ninety degree optimum, unlike prior art devices such as that of U.S. Pat. No. 5,357,677, issued to J. W. West. In the West device the cord approach to the lever forms an obtuse angle and moves away from the ninety degree optimum as the lever is moved.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In the present invention, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cord  28</span>  runs between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">trigger mechanism  40</span> , over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">first roller  42</span>  and over the specially sized a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">nd compartmentally placed second roller  44</span>  where the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cord  28</span>  begins the approach to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lever  28</span> , to which it is secured. At the other end the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cord  28</span>  is secured to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">trigger mechanism  40</span>  such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cord  28</span>  is pulled when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">trigger mechanism  40</span>  is squeezed, thus moving the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lever  28</span>  and closing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">cutting<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> jaws  24 , 26</span></span>  as discussed above. FIG. 3 depicts the two positions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">trigger mechanism  40</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lever  28</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">cutting<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> jaws  24 , 26</span></span> , at the outset and conclusion of the squeezing of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">trigger mechanism  40</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As shown in FIGS. 1-4 and  6 , and particularly FIG. 4, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">special viewing mirror  50</span>  is positionally and rotatably attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">device  10</span>  providing a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem360"> full 360</span> degree coverage of the area of operation. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">mirror  50</span>  is attached to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">mirror extension arm  52</span>  using a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">first double ball joint  54</span> . In turn, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">mirror extension arm  52</span>  is attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">extension shaft second end  34</span>  using a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">second ball joint  56</span> . The combination of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">second <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">double ball joints  54 , 56</span></span>  provide complete rotational and pivotal capabilities, enabling the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">user  12</span>  to have the proper view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">toe  16</span>  from almost any position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Although the combination of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">double <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">ball joints  54 , 56</span></span>  have been chosen for this preferred embodiment, other combinations of hinges, single ball joints and/or double ball joints could also be used, all in accordance with the present invention, and as determined by the intended end use for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">overall device  10</span> , as will occur to those of skill in the art upon review of the present disclosure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In using the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">device  10</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">user  16</span>  first positions the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">nail clipper assembly  18</span>  near the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">toe  16</span>  for an assessment of the current position of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">mirror  50</span> . If the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">mirror  50</span>  position is unsatisfactory, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">user  12</span>  can manipulate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">mirror  50</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">extension arm  52</span>  about either or both of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">second <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">double ball joints  54 , 56</span></span>  until a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">satisfactory mirror  50</span>  is obtained.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      With the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">mirror  50</span>  appropriately adjusted, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">nail clipper assembly  18</span>  is positioned proximate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">toe  16</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">user  12</span>  grasps the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">pistol grip handle  36</span> . Using the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">mirror  50</span>  to ensure a proper approach, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">user  12</span>  guides the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">cutting<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> jaws  24 , 26</span></span>  into position about the toenail and squeezes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">trigger mechanism  40</span> . This actuates the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">cord  46</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">rollers<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">  42 , 44</span></span>  combination resulting in a pull being exerted on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">nail clipper assembly lever  28</span> . As the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lever  28</span>  is pulled the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">cutting<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> jaws  24 , 26</span></span>  are pressed against the toenail and the cut is completed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It will be understood that each of the elements described above, or two or more together may also find a useful application in other applications differing from that described above.  </p>
