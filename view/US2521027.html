                        <p>  NIPPERS WITH RETAINER FOR WORK CLIPPINGS Filed Sept. 27, 1947 iatented Sept. 5,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  NIPPERS WITH RETAINER FOR WORK CLIPPIN GS George E. Sorensen, Stratford, Conn, assignor to 0. E. Sorensen, Incorporated, Bridgeport, Conn., a corporation of Connecticut Application September 27, 1947, Serial No. 776,591   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention relates to nipping implements of the plier type and particularly concerns improvements in such implements intended for use in cutting or trimming toenails or fingernails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The clipping action of ordinary pedary or manicuring nippers causes the nail clippings to be snapped away from the implement in uncontrolled directions. An object of this invention is to prevent the clippings from being projected away from the implement by confining and accumulating them in a catch space which may be formed at least in part by one or both of the instrument jaws until the accumulated clippings are purposely discharged from or dumped out of such space.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object is to provide a conventional nipper implement with a clippings retainer which is firmly but removably lodged in place on the implement and preferably without resort to extraneous fastening means, whereby mere finger pressure combined with finger shoving action suflices to apply and remove the retainer.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Still further objects are to provide conventional metallic nippers with a neat streamlined retainer of minimum bulk having graceful and pleasing lines and tinted with color whether or not transparent for thereby lending a gay and dressed-up tone to the otherwise utilitarian appearance of metallic nip-pers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The foregoing and related aims of the invention will become evident in connection with the following description and drawings having reference thereto disclosing a successful embodiment of the invention, in which drawings:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 1 illustrates in pedary use a nipping implement with clippings retainer incorporating the present improvements.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 2 is an elevation of the implement shown in Fig. l in preferred actual size.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 3 is an enlarged view of the jaws of the implement taken in section on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> plane 33</span> in Fig. 2 looking in the direction of the arrows.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 4 is a view similar to Fig. 3 with the clippings retainer normally bowed or unsprung as before fastening it to the jaw of the nippers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 5 shows the clippings retainer as viewed in Fig. 2 on a larger scale similar to Fig. 3 and removed from the implement.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 6 is a view taken in section on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> plane 66</span> in Fig. 5 looking in the direction of the arrows.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 7 is a perspective view of the retainer removed from the nipper jaws.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 8 is a view taken in section on the plane 8-8 in Fig. 2 looking in the direction of the arrows.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  11 Claims. (Cl. 30-28) Fig. 9 is a fragmentary perspective view of the clippings catch pocket.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 1 illustrates a conventional manner of use of pedary nippers in clipping a toenail, the implement here illustrated being equipped with a practical form of clippings retainer embodying the present invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The nipper implement herein shown is conventional in having two levers including nipper jaws ill and II respectively integral with handles [2 and i3 hinged together for relative swinging movement by means of a pivot pin E i fixed in rotative relation to jaw l l and with respect to which the jaw iii is free to swing. Also as in common practice, one of the handles [3 carries attached thereto a leaf spring I? fastened by a screw or rivet [3 at a median point in its length so that one end of leaf spring ll is free for resilient flexing while bearing against the other handle l2 in a manner constantly urging the handles to separate and constantly urging the nipper jaws toward their open relationship shown in Fig. 2. When the jaws are manually closed by squeezing the handles toward each other, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> work c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lipping edges 20 and 2</span></span>| meet throughout their length. They are held together for so meeting by the axial thrust afforded by the headed-over ends of pivot pin [4.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Two of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> broads<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">ide jaw faces 22 and 23</span></span> of jaws l0 and II, respectively, are relatively inclined so that when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> edges 29</span> and 2i meet, these jaw faces combine to form a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> concavity 24</span> receptive to clippings nipped off from the work. Such clippings are indicated herein as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> fragments 26</span> ofa toenail or fingernail. According to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> present improvements concavity 24</span> is bridged by a retainer here shown in the form of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> removable guard plate attachment 2</span>? that covers and forms a closure across the concavity operative to retain the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> clippings 26</span> therein.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Retainer 27</span> may have devious forms and be made of various kinds of material but preferably will be a bowed tapering plate neatly conforming in elevation as in Fig. 2 to the outline shape of the jaws of the implement and be carried in fixed relation to one of such jaws ll in a manner not to interfere with the swinging movement relative position on the implement.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  characterized by particular structural shapes enabling it to be made as a separate piece that is readily detachable as a unit from the implement jaws. It will preferably be made of a springy material and more abruptly bowed lengthwise than is the convex curvature of the concavo-convex jaws of the implement along which the retainer abuts, whereby &#39;finger thrust on the retainer toward the convex retainer supporting surface of the implement jaw, or in the direction of arrow P in Fig. 4, will cause a flattening fiexure of the retainer yieldingly opposedb&#39;yits bwmbowin&#39;g tendency. This normal bowing tendency of the retainer is made use of to accomplish firm lodgment of the retainer on the&#39;support surface of the implement jaw without use of extraneous fas tening means. The ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> retainer or guard plate 21</span> which bear against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> support surface 32</span> of jaw H are spaced apart terminal portions of the plate connected by an intermediate resilient section of the plate that spans the space between them.
