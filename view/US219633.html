                        <p>  ALBERT W. GIEFORD, OF WORCESTER, MASSACHUSETTS.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  IMPROVEMENT IN COMBINED TWEEZERS AND FINGER-NAIL CUTTER.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Specification forming part of Letters Patent No. 219,633, dated September 16, 1879; application filed June 28, 1879.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, ALBERT W. GIFFORD, of the city and county of Worcester, and State of Massachusetts, have invented a new and useful Improvement in Tweezers; and do hereby declare the same to be described in the following specification and represented in the accompanying drawings, of which Figure 1 is a side view, Figs. 2 and 3 opposite edge views, Fig. 4 a longitudinal section, and Fig. 5 a transverse section, of tweezers in accordance with my invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The whole is a combination of tweezer jaws and shanks and a file and knife or blade, in which the blade and file are in one piece, the file being the blade-shank, and arranged between and fixed to the shanks of the jaws of the tweezers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The file has a width less than that of the said shanks, which project beyond each of the cutting-edges of the file, so as to serve as guides for the finger-nail of a person while in the act of being filed.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The knife-blade has a concave cutting-edge, terminating in blunt projections or guards, that prevent the said edge from cuttingthe vest-pocket of a person while the instrument may be therein.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the drawings, A A are the tweezer-jaws, provided with shanks c c, as shown. B is the file, and (l the knife.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The concave cutting-edge of the knife-blade is represented at a, and the two blunt projections at b b, the said edge being extended from one to the other of said projections.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The file B constitutes the shank of the blade, and is arranged between the shanks c c of the elastic jaws A A of the tweezers, the   </p>
                    
                        <p>  said file and shanks being fastened together by rivets e e going through them and arranged as shown.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Well as for sharpening alead-pencil. Fur-- thermore, the knife-blade, at its upper part, I usually construct an gular or pointed, as shown, to enable it to be used in cleaning the fingernails of dirt or matter that may collect under them or between them and the fingers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  What therefore I claim as my invention is as follows:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1. The combination of the tweezer jaws and shanks and the file and blade, the said file and blade being in one piece, and the file being arranged between and fixed, as described, to the shanks of the jaws of the tweezers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2. The combined tweezers, file, and blade, havingthe file so arranged between the shanks of the tweezers that they may project beyond either or each of its cutting-edges in manner to serve as guides to a fingernail while in the act of being reduced by the file.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   3. The blade having the concave cuttingedge and the blunt termini or guards thereto, arranged as represented, in combination with the file and the tweezer shanks and jaws, arranged and applied substantially as set forth.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  ALBERT w. GIFFORD.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Witnesses:   </p>
