                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> The present invention provides a nail clipper having a hole to receive a key chain wherein the hole is a sufficient distance from the lever arm of the clipper to easily expose the hole for receiving a key chain. The key ring hole is better exposed, with no hindrance from the pivot arm, either via an extension of the clippers themselves or through a shortening of the pivot arm. </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0011]    A key component of a well-groomed appearance is a set of carefully trimmed nails. Cosmetically attractive, nails that are clean and neatly trimmed are also an important factor in a person&#39;s overall health. Fingernails and toenails are made up of keratin, a tenacious protein which also makes up the epidermis and the greater portion of the hair. Growing outward from the matrix, (or nail root) and resting on the nail bed, the nail plate grows at a rate of one inch per month, however this rate slows as a person ages. While finger and toe nails serve to enhance that fine touch and also facilitate the manipulation of small objects, their main purpose is to protect the underlying digit. If nails are neglected, this protective action can fail, causing harm and injury to the finger or the toe. Although ingrown nails are a common occurrence when nails are not trimmed properly, inflammation and infection of the cuticle, nail bed or matrix can also result.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    To keep nail clippers at the ready at all times, many endeavor to utilize the hole at the end of the nail clipper units to attach to a key ring. However, this can sometimes be problematic as many nail clipper models allow the pivot pin to overlap the hole. As a result, the clippers tend to look and feel awkward when affixed to key rings. The present invention, hereinafter referred to as Hole Exposed on the Key Ring Nail Clipper, is a practical invention that offers consumers a practical solution to the aforementioned problem. The present invention is a specially designed pair of fingernail clippers which feature a specially designed extended proximal end that better exposes the key ring hole in these devices. Similar in appearance to a standard pair of nail clippers, the nail clipper of the present invention is configured with two, high carbon surgical steel cutting blades positioned at the end of elongate handles which are joined together by a spring and pivot pin.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]    An integrated metal nail file is also incorporated into the clippers and is secured over the top handle via the previously mentioned pivot pin. As with traditional nail clippers, the upper and lower cutting blades found on the clipper of the present invention is slightly contoured, boasting a crescent shape which accommodates the natural shape of the fingernail. Further, this precision blade is sharpened ensuring a neat and even trim. The most notable aspect of the present invention however, and what sets this trimming tool apart from other nail clippers is found in the proximal end of the unit. The key ring hole is better exposed, with no hindrance from the pivot arm, either via an extension of the clippers themselves or through a shortening of the pivot arm. As such, users of these devices are able to easily and expediently attach the unit to a key ring, where clippers are readily accessible whenever needed. In addition, the hole placement enhancement offers aesthetic appeal, blending with any other objects on a key ring with smooth and even lines. A similar design can be enlarged to include the larger toenail clippers, as well. Simple in design yet effective in application, the present invention is an innovation that is sure to be well received by the general consumer populace, an extremely sizable market potential.  </p>
