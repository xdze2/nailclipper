                        <p>  WILLIAM W. HAYDEN, OF NEWARK, NEW JERSEY.   </p>

                        <p>  SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 515,828, dated March 6, 1 894.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Application filed March 11, 1893. Serial No. 465,520. (No model.)   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern.-   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, WILLIAM W. HAYDEN, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Newark, in the county of Essex and State of New Jersey, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in a Combined Nail- File and Scissors, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Reference is to be had to the accompanying drawings forming a part of this specification, in which like letters of reference indicate corresponding parts in all the figures.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 1, is a plan view of my invention showing the scissors partially opened out from the handle. Fig. 2, is a sectional plan view showing the scissors closed into the handie. Fig. 3, is a transverse sectional view of the handle taken on the line a; m of Fig. 1, and Fig. 4, is a-perspectivc view of the box fitted in the handle to receive the spring and the scissors.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The handle A is formed with an aperture or recess a which extends to the larger end of the handle, and the handle is tapered at the opposite end as shown at b which tapered or reduced portion is, bored as shown at a to receive and hold the shank c of a nail file B. The said tapered portion extends beyond the recess a. and is made solid to rigidly hold the shank c which is pressed into the opening a to the recess a. where it may be soldered, brazed, headed or otherwise secured firmly in place.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In the recess a is fitted a box O closed at one end as at d and formed with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">side plates (1</span>&#39; d. In said box is held, by. small rivets or pins f, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> spring 1</span>), and these small rivets or pins fmay pass through the sides of the handle to hold the said box and spring firmly in place in the recess. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> outer end 9</span> of the spring is curved slightly inward and presses constantly upon the scissors E in a manner very similar to the spring of a pocket knife, said scissors, or the member e thereof,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  being formed with a notched plate e by which the scissors are held on the pivot h and against which the spring acts to hold the scissors both opened and closed. The other member a of the scissors is cross-pivoted to the member e and is acted upon by an interposed spring t held at one end in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> plate 6</span> as shown clearly in Fig. 2. By this construction I provide in very convenient and compact form and with a single handle, a combined nail file and scissors which may be conveniently carriedin the pocket, satchel or dressing case and the convenience of use is apparent as the scissors are entirely closed and out of the way while the file is in use.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having thus described my invention, what I claim, and desire to secure by Letters Patent,is   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1. Asa new and improved article of manufacture a handle formed with a recess at its edge open at one end of the handle and in which is fitted a back spring to act upon scissors, hinged in said recess, and formed at the opposite end with a solid extension, having a central bore in line with the said recess, in combination with a nail file formed with a reduced shank, and fitted in the longitudinal bore of said extension, substantially as described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2. Handle Aformed at one end with asolid extension I) having a central longitudinal bore a formed therein and formed with an edge recess a, open at one end of the handle, in combination with a nail file B having a reduced shank o fitted in said bore the box 0 closed at one end and fitted in said recess a, the back spring D and the scissors pivoted in the open end of said box and handle, substantially as described.   </p>
