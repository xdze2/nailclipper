                        <p>      FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    This invention generally relates to tools and more particularly relates to hand tools and methods of manufacturing and using same.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0003]    Conventional hand tools, such as conventional fingernail and toe nail clippers, have proven problematic to use, particularly when used by the elderly, arthritic individuals, stroke victims and others who have limited range of arm, wrist and hand movement.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    More specifically, conventional fingernail and toe nail clippers have a spring handle that pivots about a fulcrum. Connected to the handle is a lever that is configured to downwardly press against the handle, so as to cause cutting edges formed on the handle to contact each other. However, the handle and lever must be in alignment with each other during the nail clipping operation to achieve efficient operation of the device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    Movement of the handle and lever into alignment during the nail clipping operation requires extensive manipulation of the handle and lever and extensive dexterity on the part of the user. Such extensive manipulation and need for extensive dexterity is problematic for elderly persons, arthritic individuals, stroke victims and others having limited arm, wrist and hand movement.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    As another example, with respect to surgical instruments, it is often necessary to perform surgery on difficult-to-reach areas of the human body without obstructing the surgeon&#39;s field of view. This is also true with respect to veterinarians who perform surgery on animals. Also, in the specific case of surgery, it is also often necessary for the surgeon to use one surgical instrument, such as scissors, to perform a clipping/cutting procedure on a body structure, while using another surgical instrument, such as forceps or clamps, to hold the body structure. These two surgical instruments typically have significantly different fixed configurations. Having to stock a multiplicity of surgical instruments in hospital inventory with significantly different fixed configurations for performing different surgical functions is inconvenient and costly.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    As a further example, with respect to wire and bolt cutters, it is sometimes necessary to sever cables and bolts located in confined spaces and recesses. This may be necessary when performing machinery repair, remodeling/renovating buildings, rescue of persons trapped by fallen building structure and debris, and rescue of persons trapped in damaged automobiles due to a collision. Use of cable and bolt cutters having configurations with cutting edges in a permanent, fixed orientation can make such cutting operations more difficult.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    Attempts have been made to address the considerations mentioned hereinabove with respect to the structure and use of hand tools. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,062,666 titled “Nail Clipper” issued Nov. 12, 1991, in the name of Jaw-Shiunn Tsay relates to an improved nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    According to the Tsay patent, the nail clipper comprises an elongate lever, a short upper body, a long lower body and a joint pin to assemble the lever and both the upper and the lower bodies together at their front sections, so that the lever can be pressed down to compress the upper body downward on the lower body. The nail clipper further comprises two opposed pairs of curved cutting edges provided on opposite sides of the upper and the lower bodies (see FIGS. 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Tsay patent). The cutting edges are fixed at two positions, one position being perpendicular to the other position. This patent states that an advantage of the nail clipper is that the two pairs of cutting edges can easily clip nails on the other hand after finishing one hand.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    However, the Tsay patent discloses that the cutting edges are fixed at two positions, one position being perpendicular to the other position. Fixing the cutting edges at two positions may nonetheless require a user to extensively manipulate the nail clipper to clip nails. Requiring the user to extensively manipulate the nail clipper to clip nails is inconvenient for the user.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    Another attempt to address the considerations mentioned hereinabove with respect to the structure and use of hand tools is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,742,957 titled “Surgical Clamp” issued Jul. 3, 1973, in the name of Jack H. White. The White patent relates to surgical and like clamps.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    According to the White patent, a clamp includes a set of jaws including a gripping portion and an actuating portion and pin means pivotally connecting the jaws for movement between open and closed positions within a first plane. A set of handles comprising crank arms are disposed and operable between the open and closed positions within a second plane. The second plane is mutually intersecting with the first plane and the crank arms are connected to the actuating portion of the jaws at the junctures of respective leg portions of the crank arms. As mentioned in the White patent, this connection comprises a hinge for infinite angular positioning of the first plane containing the jaws with respect to the second plane containing the crank arms. Also, the leg portions of the crank arms are pivotally joined as by a pin, which in the illustrated embodiment comprises a screw, to provide for opening and closing movement of the handles.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]    However, the White patent discloses that opening and closing movement of the handles is accomplished by adjustment of a screw (i.e., pin) that joins the handles. Only allowing opening and closing movement of the handles by means of a screw creates unnecessary delay in adjusting the clamp before surgery, readjusting the clamp during surgery, if necessary, and releasing the clamp after surgery because a screw driver is apparently needed to adjust the screw. Such a delay before, during and after a surgical procedure is undesirable.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0014]    Another attempt to address the considerations mentioned hereinabove with respect to the structure and use of hand tools is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,020,242 titled “Swivel Head Tool” issued Nov. 5, 1935, in the name of G. W. Geddes. The Geddes patent relates to tools in which the jaws may be placed in various angular positions relative to an operating handle system.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0015]    According to the Geddes patent, a bolt clipper embodying a jaw lever system and an actuating handle lever system are provided. The jaw levers can be adjusted to various angular positions relative to the plane of the handle levers so as to permit operating swinging movement of the jaws. For this purpose, joints embody mating spherical surfaces and tail portions of the jaw levers are provided with shallow recesses of spherical contour, which receive interposed balls on which at least of one of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> parts turns (see column 2</span>, lines 15-37 of the Geddes patent). This patent also discloses that handle members are apparently pivotally mounted by means of a screw-like pin.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0016]    However, although the Geddes patent discloses handle members that are pivotally mounted, this patent apparently requires adjustment of a screw-like pin in order to return the handle members to their default position. Requiring adjustment of the screw-like pin in order to return the handle members to their default position is inconvenient for the user because a screw driver is apparently needed to adjust the screw-like pin.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0017]    Although the approaches recited hereinabove disclose various configurations of hand tools, the approaches recited hereinabove do not appear to disclose the invention described and claimed hereinbelow.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0018]    The present invention addresses the shortcomings of the prior art approaches mentioned hereinabove by providing a suitable hand tool, and method of manufacturing and using same.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]    According to a first embodiment of the present invention, the hand tool comprises a handle assembly that, in use, is oriented in a y-axis plane. The handle assembly is sized and contoured to be manipulated by hand. In this regard, the handle assembly includes a generally smooth, arcuate-shaped upper handle member and a generally smooth, arcuate-shaped lower handle member disposed opposite the upper handle member. In this manner, the upper handle member and the lower handle member are disposed in the same y-axis plane for grasping by the user. In addition, the upper handle member and the lower handle member are pivotally linked or pivotally joined together by a linkage bolt that allows pivoting action of the handle members in the y-axis plane. That is, the upper and lower handle members pivot toward each other to a closed position when the user grasps and simultaneously applies manual pressure to the upper and lower handle members. A biasing member, which may be in the form of a leaf spring, is interposed between the handle members for automatically biasing the handle members away from each other in order to return the handle members to their default open position after hand pressure is released.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]    The hand tool also comprises a coupler assembly including an upper coupler and a lower coupler. The upper coupler includes an articulating upper heim joint and the lower coupler includes an articulating lower heim joint. The upper heim joint is connected to the upper handle member and the lower heim joint is connected to the lower handle member. The upper and lower heim joints are each provided with threaded shanks for threadably engaging their respective upper and lower handle members. In this manner, the upper and lower heim joints are fixedly attached to their respective upper and lower handle members. As known in the art, a heim joint (i.e., also referred to in the art as a rose joint, rod end bearing, or heim bearing) allows multi-directional, such as side-to-side (i.e., rotational or swiveling), and tilting, substantially frictionless movement of a component connected to it without breaking of the component.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]    As contemplated by the invention, a component comprising a tool head is connected to the upper and lower heim joints. The tool head can be fingernail or toe nail clipper blades, surgical clamp jaws, bolt cutter blades or other tool head. For example, with respect to blade tools (e.g., fingernail or toe nail clippers, bolt cutters), the tool head comprises an upper blade tool pivotally connected to the upper heim joint and a lower blade tool pivotally connected to the lower heim joint. A pivot pin joins the upper blade tool and the lower blade tool. In this manner, the pivot pin, upper heim joint and lower heim joint cooperate to allow simultaneous side-to-side (i.e., rotational or swiveling) movement of the upper and lower blade tools in addition to allowing closing and opening of the blade tools. The user manually moves the blade tools to a desired side-to-side (i.e., rotated, swiveled) and/or tilted orientation for operating on a work piece. When the user grasps and simultaneously applies manual pressure to the upper and lower handle members, the upper and lower handle members pivot toward each other and lock in position. As the upper and lower handle members pivot toward each other, the upper and lower blade tools also pivot toward each other due to the previously mentioned interconnection of the blade tools with the handle members. As the upper and lower blade tools pivot toward each other in this manner, the upper blade tool and the lower blade tool dose. Conversely, as manual pressure is released, the upper and lower handle members automatically pivot away from each other due to presence of the biasing member interposed between them. Thus, as the upper and lower handle members pivot away from each other, the upper blade tool and the lower blade tool open, which is the default position of the device. In this manner, manual actuation of the handle members in cooperation with the heim joints that interconnect the tool head assembly and the handle assembly allow opening and closing of the upper and lower blade tools.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]    The upper and lower heim joints allow their respective upper and lower blade tools to swivel or rotate side-to-side at<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180"> least 180</span> degrees in the x-plane and tilt a limited amount (e.g.,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> about 30</span>°) in the x and y axes planes in order to conveniently position the upper and lower blade tools at a desired location on the work piece. As previously mentioned, means are provided for locking the angular (i.e., rotational, swivel or side-to-side) and tilted position of the upper and lower blade tools. In other words, once the upper and lower blade tools are positioned at the desired location on the work piece, the handle members are closed in order to lock the upper and lower blade tools in their angular position and to actuate the upper and lower blade tools, so that the upper and lower blade tools close, as previously mentioned, to cut the work piece.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]    Thus, the upper blade tool, lower blade tool, pivot pin, upper heim joint, and lower heim joint cooperate to allow the upper blade tool and lower blade tool to simultaneously swivel or rotate at<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180"> least 180</span> degrees in the x-axis plane and tilt a limited amount (i.e.,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> about 30</span>°) in the x and y axes planes for positioning the upper blade tool and lower tool at the desired location for operating on the work piece.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    In this first embodiment of the invention, the tool head is detachable from the heim joints by means described in detail hereinbelow. This allows decoupling of the tool head from the heim joints, so that different types of tool heads and various sizes of the same type of tool head can be interchanged. Also, providing for detachment or decoupling of the tool head from the heim joints allows replacement of a worn tool head. Thus, the hand tool of the present invention is versatile and accommodates tool heads required for different applications.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]    Therefore, the 180 degree rotational (i.e., swivel) feature and the tilting feature allow the hand tool of the first embodiment of the invention to obtain a variable angle of attack on a work piece. Obtaining such a variable of attack allows the hand tool to be conveniently manipulated in a manner that is particularly useful for elderly persons, arthritic individuals, stroke victims and others who have a limited range of arm, wrist and hand movement. The variable angle of attack also allows the hand tool to be conveniently manipulated in a manner that is particularly useful for performing surgical procedures on structures located in difficult-to-reach areas of the human body without obstructing the surgeon&#39;s field of view. In addition, the variable angle of attack allows the hand tool to be conveniently manipulated in a manner for cutting cables and bolts located in difficult to access, confined spaces.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]    A second embodiment of the invention is strictly in the form of a fingernail or toe nail clipper and has some features similar to the features of the first embodiment of the invention. In this regard, the second embodiment of the invention comprises a pair of handle members each including a relatively thin, arcuate-shaped outer shell matingly mounted on an arcuate-shaped inner supporting frame member. The outer shell covers the frame member, so that the frame member is not substantially visible. The outer shell may be formed from an aesthetically pleasing, decorative polymer plastic material, or other aesthetically pleasing material, and the frame member may be a light weight metal, metal alloy or other light-weight composition, so that the nail clipper may be easily carried in pocket or purse. Pair of oppositely disposed, pivotable cutting edges are interposed between distal end portions of the handle members and are generally concealed from view by the distal end portions of the handle members when viewed from the top or bottom of the device. A pair of heim joints interconnects respective ones of the pair of handle members with respective ones of the pair of cutting edges. The heim joints allow side-to-side rotational or swiveling movement of the cutting edges through an angle of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180"> about 180</span>°. The upper handle member and the lower handle member are pivotally joined together by a pivot pin that allows pivoting action of the handle members in the y-axis plane. The upper and lower handle members pivot toward each other to a closed position when the user grasps and simultaneously applies manual pressure to the upper and lower handle members. The cutting edges are simultaneously locked in position and cut the fingernails or toe nails of the user when hand pressure is applied to close the handle members. A biasing member, which may be in the form of a torsion spring, is interposed between the handle members for biasing the handle members to their open default position when hand pressure is released by the user.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]    Therefore, the 180 degree side-to-side (i.e., rotational or swivel) movement feature of the cutting edges belonging to this second embodiment of the invention allows the device to obtain a variable angle of attack, so that fingernails and toe nails can be conveniently clipped by elderly persons, arthritic individuals, stroke victims and others who have a limited range of arm, wrist and hand movement.  </p>

                        <p>        [0060]    In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from either the spirit or scope of the invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0061]    In addition, the present patent specification uses formal outline headings for clarity of presentation. However, it is to be understood that the outline headings are for presentation purposes, and that different types of subject matter may be discussed throughout the application (e.g., device(s)/structure(s) may be described under process(es)/operations heading(s) and/or process(es)/operations may be discussed under structure(s)/process(es) headings; and/or descriptions of single topics may span two or more topic headings). Hence, the use of the formal outline headings is not intended to be in any way limiting.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0062]    Therefore, with reference to  FIGS. 1 ,  2  and  3 , there is shown a first embodiment hand tool, generally referred as  1000 , for operating on a work piece (not shown). In the exemplary embodiment illustrated, hand tool  1000  is a fingernail or toe nail clipper for clipping or cutting fingernails and toe nails of a user (also not shown). However, it will be appreciated that hand tool  1000  is not limited to the configuration of a fingernail or toe nail clipper. Rather, hand tool  1000  may be in the configuration of other types of hand tools, as well, such as clamps and bolt cutters.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0063]    Referring again to  FIGS. 1 ,  2  and  3 , hand tool  1000  comprises a first embodiment hand held tool mount or handle assembly  1010  shown oriented in a y-axis or first plane.

The contoured or arcuate shape of upper handle member  1020  and lower handle member  1030  facilitates grasping thereof by the user of hand tool  1000 . Upper handle member  1020  defines a proximal end portion  1032   a  and a distal end portion  1032   b  for reasons recited hereinbelow. Similarly, lower handle member  1030  defines a proximal end portion  1035   a  and a distal end portion  1035   b  for reasons recited hereinbelow. The handle assembly  1010  is also provided with a resilient biasing member in the form of an elongate leaf spring  1040  for reasons provided hereinbelow. In this regard, leaf spring  1040  has a unitary construction that includes a central straight segment portion  1050 , which is disposed between an upper straight portion  1050   a  and a lower rounded or curved end portion  1050   b . Upper straight portion  1050   a  is positioned generally intermediate proximal end portion  1032   a  and distal end portion  1032   b  of upper handle member  1020 . Lower rounded or curved end portion  1050   b  is positioned generally intermediate proximal end portion  1035   a  and distal end portion  1035   b  of lower handle member  1030 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0064]    Still referring to  FIGS. 1 ,  2  and  3 , in order to hold the handle members  1020 / 1030  apart, lower rounded or curved end portion  1050   b  of leaf spring  1040  is mounted within a lower handle member cutout  1060  by a mounting or spring pin indicated generally at  1070 . Cutout  1060  is disposed at an inner rearward surface area of lower handle member  1030  in a manner that allows leaf spring  1040  to be disposed at an inclined angle between upper handle member  1020  and lower handle member  1030 . The opposite end of leaf spring  1040 , which terminates in upper straight portion  1050   a , permits the opposite or upper straight portion  1050   a  to rest in engagement with an inner surface area of upper handle member  1020 . In short, leaf spring  1040  is wedged between upper handle member  1020  and lower handle member  1030  to provide a return force when the two handle members  1020 / 1030  are manually squeezed together by the user, such as in the direction of directional arrows  1075   a  and  1075   b  (see  FIG. 5A ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0065]    Referring again to  FIGS. 1 ,  2 , and  3 , upper handle member  1020  and lower handle member  1030  are pivotably connected to each other on an axis defined by a mounting or linkage bolt  1080  and are held apart from one another, in a default position, by the previously mentioned leaf spring  1040 . Linkage bolt  1080  therefore facilitates holding the two handle members  1020 / 1030  pivotally together. The previously mentioned return force is a force sufficient to cause the two handle members  1020 / 1030  to move pivotally away from one another about the axis defined by mounting or linkage bolt  1080  when handle members  1020 / 1030  are released by the user, so that handle members  1020 / 1030  return to their default or open positions as best seen in  FIG. 1 . Although leaf spring  1040  of a particular configuration is illustrated, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that other suitable biasing or spring means may be utilized, such as a coiled compression spring (not shown) or other suitable spring means.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0066]    As shown in  FIGS. 1 ,  2  and  3 , hand tool  1000  further includes a heim joint coupler assembly [THE HANDLE ASSEMBLY WAS ALREADY CALLED A TOOL MOUNT] indicated generally at  1090 . The coupler assembly  1090  includes an upper mount or upper coupler in the form of an articulating upper heim joint  1100 . Coupler assembly  1090  further includes a lower mount or lower coupler in the form of an articulating lower heim joint  1110 , [WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO DESCRIBE DIFFERENT ASSEMBLY COMPONENTS YOU SHOULD SEPARATE THE REFERENCE CHARACTERS BY AT<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> LEAST 100</span> UNITS—THIS ALLOWS YOU TO KEEP UPPER ASSEMBLY COMPONENT TOGETHER AND LOWER ASSEMBLY COMPONENT TOGETHER WHICH ALSO ALLOWS THE DRAWING PARTS TO BE MORE EASILY IDENTIFIED] Upper heim joint  1100  is threadably attached to distal end portion  1032   b  of upper handle member  1020  by means of an elongate, externally threaded upper shank portion  1120  that is received in an internally threaded upper bore or hole  1130  formed in distal end portion  1032   b . Similarly, lower heim joint  1110  is threadably attached to distal end portion  1035   b  of lower handle member  1030  by means of an elongate, externally threaded lower shank portion  1140  that is received in an internally threaded lower bore or hole  1150  formed in distal end portion  1035   b . Thus, upper shank portion  1120  is threadably received in upper hole  1130  and lower shank portion  1140  is threadably received in lower hole  1150  for coupling shank portions  1120 / 1140  to handle members  1020 / 1030 , respectively. However, shank portions  1120 / 1140  and holes  1130 / 1150  need not be threaded; rather, shank portions  1120 / 1140  and holes  1130 / 1150  may be smooth and sized for allowing coupling of shank portions  1120 / 1140  to handle members  1020 / 1030  by means of a press-fit.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0067]    Referring to  FIGS. 1 ,  4 ,  4 A,  5 ,  5 A and  6 , upper heim joint  1100  comprises an annular upper casing  1160  integrally attached to upper shank portion  1120 . Upper casing  1160  defines an opening  1165  therethrough for reasons provided hereinbelow. In addition, upper casing  1160  may have a generally spherical interior (not shown) contoured for slidably, matingly receiving a spherical upper ball swivel  1170 , such that upper ball swivel  1170  is slidably retained within upper casing  1160 . Upper ball swivel  1170  defines an upper ball hole  1180  (see  FIG. 6 ) centrally therethrough for reasons provided hereinbelow. In this manner, upper ball swivel  1170  is capable of multi-directional, slidable movement within upper casing  1160 . In other words, upper ball swivel  1170  is capable of side-to-side, rotational, or swivel movement in the horizontal x-axis plane as illustrated by directional arrow  1182  (see  FIG. 1 ). In addition, upper ball swivel  1170  is capable of tilting movement in the y-axis plane as illustrated by directional arrow  1184  (see  FIGS. 1 and 5A ) as well as tilting movement in the x-axis plane as illustrated by directional arrow  1186  (see  FIG. 1 ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0068]    Referring again to  FIGS. 1 ,  4 ,  4 A,  5 ,  5 A and  6 , lower heim joint  1110  comprises an annular lower casing  1190  integrally attached to lower shank portion  1140 . Lower casing  1190  defines a lower casing opening  1195  therethrough for reasons provided hereinbelow. In addition, lower casing  1190  may have a generally spherical interior (not shown) contoured for slidably, matingly receiving spherical lower ball swivel  1200 , such that lower ball swivel  1200  is slidably retained within lower casing  1190 . Lower ball swivel  1200  defines a lower ball hole  1210  (see  FIG. 6 ) centrally therethrough for reasons provided hereinbelow. In this manner, lower ball swivel  1200  is capable of multi-directional, slidable movement within lower casing  1190 . In other words, lower ball swivel  1200  is capable of side-to-side, rotational, or swivel movement in the horizontal x-axis plane as illustrated by previously mentioned directional arrow  1182  (see  FIG. 1 ). In addition, lower ball swivel  1200  is capable of tilting movement in the y-axis plane as illustrated by directional arrow  1205  (see  FIGS. 1 and 5A ) as well as tilting movement in the x-axis plane as illustrated by previously mentioned directional arrow  1186  (see  FIG. 1 ). As described fully hereinbelow, it will be appreciated that ball swivels  1170 / 1200  will rotate and tilt in unison as will be explained in greater detail hereinafter.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0069]    Referring to  FIGS. 1 ,  3 ,  4 ,  4 A,  5 ,  5 A and  6 , to provide hand tool  1000  with the functionality noted hereinabove, hand tool  1000  further includes a replaceable, first embodiment tool head assembly, generally referred to as  1220 , for clipping fingernails and toe nails of the user of hand tool  1000 . In other words, tool head assembly  1220 , which is coupled to handle assembly  1010  by means of coupler assembly  1090 , is capable of operating on (i.e., clipping) the fingernails and toe nails (i.e., the work piece) of the user in response to hand manipulation of handle assembly  1010 , as described in detail presently. In this regard, tool head assembly  1220  generally includes an upper tool member  1230  and a lower tool member  1240  both disposed in the y-axis plane, lower tool member  1240  being oriented opposite to and coincident with upper tool member  1230 . Lower tool member  1240  includes a lower tool member [IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO USE NAMES AS OPPOSED TO FIRST, SECOND, ETC.] pivoting portion  1250   a  and upper tool member  1230  includes an upper tool member pivoting portion  1250   b  (see  FIG. 3 ). The lower tool member pivoting portion  1250   a  and upper tool member pivoting portion  1250   b  are pivotably interconnected by a pivot pin  1260 . Thus, the pivotable interconnection of first pivoting portion  1250   a  and second pivoting portion  1250   b  allow lower tool member  1240  and upper tool member  1230  to pivot about pivot pin  1260  for reasons provided hereinbelow.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0070]    Referring yet again to  FIGS. 1 ,  4 ,  4 A,  5 ,  5 A and  6 , upper tool member  1230  has a unitary construction and includes an upper jaw  1270  in the form of an upper blade tool having an upper tool elongate front cutting edge portion  1280 . Similarly, lower tool member  1240  has a unitary construction and includes a lower jaw  1290  opposite upper jaw  1270 . The lower jaw  1290  is in the form of a lower blade tool having a lower tool elongate front cutting edge portion  1300 . Fingernails and toe nails of the user are clipped or cut when cutting edge portions  1280 / 1300  are brought to bear against each in the manner described hereinbelow.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0071]    Still referring to  FIGS. 1 ,  4 ,  4 A,  5 ,  5 A and  6 , upper tool member  1230  includes an upper arm portion  1304   a  and a lower arm portion  1304   b . Lower arm portion  1304   b  is disposed opposite of and coincident with upper arm portion  1304   a . Upper arm portion  1304   a  defines an internally threaded upper arm bore  1306   a  therethrough and lower arm portion  1304   b  defines an internally threaded lower arm bore  1306   b  therethrough (see  FIG. 4A ), upper arm bore  1306   a  and lower arm bore  1306   b  are aligned with previously mentioned upper ball hole  1180  defined by the upper ball swivel  1170 . Similarly, lower tool member  1240  includes a third or another upper arm portion  1308   a  and a fourth or another lower arm portion  1308   b . The lower tool member lower arm portion  1308   b  is disposed opposite of and coincident with the lower tool member upper arm portion  1308   a . The lower tool upper arm portion  1308   a  defines an internally threaded lower tool upper arm bore  1309   a  therethrough and lower tool lower arm portion  1308   b  defines an internally threaded lower tool lower arm bore  1309   b  therethrough (see  FIG. 4A ). The lower tool lower arm bore  1309   a  and the lower tool upper arm bore  1309   b  are aligned with previously mentioned lower ball hole  1210  defined by lower ball swivel  1200 . Moreover, upper arm portion  1304   a  and lower arm portion  1304   b  of the upper tool member  1230  are spaced apart, so as to define a space  1310  therebetween for receiving upper heim joint  1100  thereinto. Similarly, upper arm portion  1308   a  and lower arm portion  1308   b  of the lower tool member  1240  are space apart, so as to define another space  1320  therebetween for receiving lower heim joint  1110  thereinto. Spaces  1310  and  1320  are sized to accommodate presence of heim joints  1100 / 1110  therein and allow tool head assembly  1220  to freely rotate in the x-axis plane without obstruction. In this regard, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the arm that ball swivels  1170 / 1200  will rotate and tilt in unison and to a like extent due to their interconnection by means of the upper tool member  1230 , the lower tool member  1240  and the pivot pin  1260  (see FIGS.  1 , 4 ,  4 A,  5  and  5 A).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0072]    Although not critical, it is nonetheless important that tool head assembly  1220  be detachably coupled to coupler assembly  1090 , so that different types of tool head assemblies  1220  and various sizes of the same type of tool head assembly  1220  can be interchanged. Also, providing for detachment of tool head assembly  1220  from coupler assembly  1090  allows replacement of a worn tool head assembly  1220 . Thus, hand tool  1000  is versatile and accommodates tool head assemblies required for different applications.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0073]    Referring again to  FIGS. 1 ,  4 ,  4 A,  5 ,  5 A and  6 , the manner in which tool head assembly  1220  is detachably coupled to coupler assembly  1090  will now be described. In this regard, an upper connecting member, such as externally threaded upper tool screw-bolt  1330  (see  FIG. 6 ), is caused to threadably engage internally threaded upper arm bore  1306   a  and internally threaded lower arm bore  1306   b  as upper tool screw-bolt  1330  extends through upper arm bore  1306   a , upper ball hole  1180  defined by upper ball swivel  1170  and into lower arm bore  1306   b . In this manner, upper heim joint  1100  is retained within space  1310  as upper tool member  1230  rotates and/or tilts.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0074]    Similarly, a lower connecting member, such as externally threaded lower tool screw-bolt  1340 , is caused to threadably engage internally threaded lower arm bore  1309   b  and internally threaded upper arm bore  1309   a  as lower tool screw-bolt  1340  extends through upper arm bore  1309   b , lower ball hole  1210  defined by lower ball swivel  1200  and into upper arm bore  1309   a . In this manner, lower heim joint  1110  is retained within space  1320  as lower tool member  1240  rotates and/or tilts. Also, in this manner, upper tool member  1230  and lower tool member  1240  are detachably coupled to upper heim joint  1100  and lower heim joint  1110 , respectively, due to use of screw bolts  1330 / 1340 . It should be appreciated that upper tool member  1230  and lower tool member  1240  will rotate and tilt in unison and to a like extent due to their interconnection by means of pivot pin  1260  and due to use of upper screw-bolt  1330  and lower screw-bolt  1340 , as described hereinabove. Detaching or decoupling of upper tool member  1230  and lower tool member  1240  from upper heim joint  1100  and lower heim joint  1110 , respectively, is accomplished by reversing the above-described steps for coupling upper tool member  1230  and lower tool member  1240  to upper heim joint  1100  and lower heim joint  1110 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0075]    As previously indicated, movement of tool head assembly  1220  is multi-directional because tool head assembly  1220  is adapted to rotate or swivel in the x-axis plane and tilt in both the x-axis and y-axis planes. Such rotation and tilting is provided by presence of upper ball swivel  1170  that belongs to upper heim joint  1100  and lower ball swivel  1200  that belongs to lower heim joint  1110 . However, for the sake of brevity, the description hereinbelow is directed only to rotation or swiveling of tool head assembly  1220  in the x-axis plane, it being understood that tool head assembly  1220  is adapted to swivel and tilt in the x-axis plane and only tilt in the y-axis plane.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0076]    Therefore, referring to  FIGS. 1 ,  7  and  8 , tool head assembly  1220  is adapted to move side-to-side (i.e., rotate or swivel) in the x-axis plane to a user selected angle less than or equal to an angle theta “Ø” of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180"> about 180</span> degrees. Tool head assembly  1220  is capable of rotating in the x-axis plane due to presence of upper ball swivel  1170  and lower ball swivel  1200 , as previously mentioned. Such side-to-side, rotational or swiveling movement of tool head assembly  1220  in the x-axis plane is accomplished by hand.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0077]    Turning now to  FIGS. 9 ,  10  and  11 , various tool head assembly embodiments are there shown. As previously mentioned, detachable first embodiment tool head assembly  1220  comprises upper jaw  1270  having upper tool front cutting edge  1280  and lower jaw  1290  having lower tool front cutting edge  1300  for cutting or clipping fingernails or toe nails of the user when upper tool cutting edge  1280  and lower tool front cutting edge  1300  are brought to bear against each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0078]    A detachable second embodiment tool head assembly, generally referred to as  1350 , comprises an upper jaw  1360  having an upper jaw clamping extension  1370  and a lower jaw  1380  having a lower jaw clamping extension  1390 . Upper jaw  1360  and lower jaw  1380  of second embodiment tool head assembly  1350  are capable of pivoting about pivot pin  1260  in a manner substantially similar to the pivoting action of upper jaw  1270  and lower jaw  1290  of first embodiment tool head  1220 . Upper jaw clamping extension  1370  and lower jaw clamping extension  1390  are capable of capturing and holding a work piece (not shown) therebetween, such as tissue being operated upon during a surgical procedure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0079]    A detachable third embodiment tool head assembly, generally referred to as  1400 , comprises an upper jaw  1410  having a upper sharpened edge  1420  and a lower jaw  1430  having a lower sharpened edge  1440 . Upper jaw  1410  and lower jaw  1430  of second embodiment tool head assembly  1440  are capable of pivoting about pivot pin  1260  in a manner substantially similar to the pivoting action of upper jaw  1270  and lower jaw  1290  of first embodiment tool head  1220 . Upper sharpened edge  1420  and lower sharpened edge  1440  are capable of shearing a work piece (not shown) therebetween, such as a bolt or cable.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0080]    Turning now to  FIGS. 12 ,  13  and  14 , there is shown a second embodiment hand tool, generally referred to as  1450 . The second embodiment hand tool  1450  comprises a second embodiment hand held tool mount or handle assembly  1460  shown oriented in a y-axis or first plane. Handle assembly  1460 , which is sized for hand manipulation or grasping by the user, comprises an upper handle member  1470  that includes a generally smooth, contoured, arcuate-shaped upper shell  1472  that matingly covers an arcuate-shaped upper frame member  1475 . Upper frame member  1475  has a proximal end portion  1477   a  and a distal end portion  1477   b . Handle assembly  1460  further comprises a lower handle member  1480  that includes a generally smooth, contoured, arcuate-shaped lower shell  1482  that matingly covers an arcuate-shaped lower frame member  1484 . Lower frame member  1484  has a proximal end portion  1485   a  and a distal end portion  1485   b . Lower handle member  1480  is disposed in the first plane opposite upper handle member  1470 . The contoured or arcuate shape of upper shell  1472  that belongs to upper handle member  1470  and the contoured or arcuate shape of lower shell  1482  that belongs to lower handle member  1480  facilitates grasping thereof by the user of hand tool  1450 . Frame members  1475 / 1484  provide support for shells  1472 / 1482  and serves other useful functions, as described hereinbelow. Upper handle member  1470  defines a proximal end portion  1486   a  and a distal end portion  1486   b  for reasons recited hereinbelow. Similarly, lower handle member  1480  defines a proximal end portion  1488   a  and a distal end portion  1488   b  for reasons recited hereinbelow. Hand tool  1450  is also provided with a resilient biasing member in the form of a coiled torsion spring  1490  for reasons provided hereinbelow. Torsion spring  1490  is disposed between upper handle member  1470  and lower handle member  1480 . Torsion spring  1490  is configured to have a pair of protruding ends  1492   a / 1492   b  thereof in contact with upper handle member  1470  and lower handle member  1480 , respectively, for providing a biasing force against upper handle member  1470  and lower handle member  1480 . In this manner, torsion spring  1490  provides a biasing return force to maintain upper handle member  1470  and lower handle member  1480  in an open default position, as shown, Upper handle member  1470  and lower handle member  1480  are maintained in the open default position until the user simultaneously applies manual pressure to upper handle member  1470  and lower handle member  1480  to move upper handle member  1470  and lower handle member  1480  closer together. This act by the user places torsion spring  1490  in compression. Upon release of the manual pressure by the user, torsion spring  1490  is released from its compressed state and expands, so that handle members  1470 / 1480  return to their open, default positions.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0081]    Referring again to  FIGS. 12 ,  13  and  14 , upper handle member  1470  and lower handle member  1480  are pivotably connected to each other on an axis defined by a mounting or linkage bolt  1500  (see  FIG. 19 ) and are held apart from one another, in a default position, by the previously mentioned torsion spring  1490 . Linkage bolt  1500  therefore facilitates holding the two handle members  1470 / 1480  pivotally together. Although torsion spring  1490  of a particular configuration is illustrated, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that other suitable biasing or spring means may be utilized, such as a coiled compression spring (not shown) or other suitable spring means.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0082]    Referring to  FIGS. 15 and 16 , hand tool  1450  generally includes a tool mount or coupler assembly indicated generally at  1510 . The coupler assembly  1510  includes an upper mount or upper coupler in the form of an articulating upper heim joint, generally referred to as  1520 . Coupler assembly  1510  further includes a lower mount or lower coupler in the form of an articulating lower heim joint, generally referred to as  1530 . Upper heim joint  1520  is threadably attached to distal end portion  1477   b  of upper frame member  1475  by means of an elongate, externally threaded upper shank portion  1540  (see  FIG. 19 ) that is received in an internally threaded upper bore or hole (not shown) formed in distal end portion  1477   b . Similarly, lower heim joint  1530  is threadably attached to distal end portion  1485   b  of lower frame member  1484  by means of an elongate, externally threaded lower shank portion  1550  that is received in an internally threaded lower bore or hole (not shown) formed in distal end portion  1485   b . Thus, upper shank portion  1540  is threadably received in the upper hole and lower shank portion  1550  is threadably received in the lower hole for coupling shank portions  1540 / 1550  to handle members  1470 / 1480 , respectively. However, shank portions  1540 / 1550  and their respective holes need not be threaded; rather, shank portions  1540 / 1550  and their respective holes may be smooth and sized for allowing coupling of shank portions  1540 / 1550  to handle members  1470 / 1480  by means of a press-fit.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0083]    Referring to  FIGS. 15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18  and  19 , upper heim joint  1520  comprises an annular upper casing  1560  integrally attached to upper shank portion  1540 . Upper casing  1560  defines an opening  1565  therethrough for reasons provided hereinbelow. In addition, upper casing  1560  may have a generally spherical interior (not shown) contoured for slidably, matingly receiving a spherical upper ball swivel  1570 , such that upper ball swivel  1570  is slidably retained within upper casing  1560 . Upper ball swivel  1570  defines a hole  1575  (see  FIG. 19 ) centrally therethrough for receiving a smooth upper connector pin  1576  about which upper ball swivel  1570  freely rotates in the x-plane. Connector pin  1576  also interconnects upper ball swivel  1570  to upper frame member  1475  and to an upper tool member  1600  as will be explained hereinafter in greater detail. In this manner, upper ball swivel  1570  is capable of multi-directional, slidable movement within upper casing  1560 . In other words, upper ball swivel  1570  is capable of side-to-side, rotational, or swivel movement in the horizontal x-axis plane as illustrated by directional arrow  1577  (see  FIG. 12 ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0084]    Referring again to  FIGS. 15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18  and  19 , lower heim joint  1530  comprises an annular lower casing  1580  integrally attached to lower shank portion  1550 . Lower casing  1580  defines an opening  1585  therethrough for reasons provided hereinbelow. In addition, lower casing  1580  may have a generally spherical interior (not shown) contoured for slidably, matingly receiving a spherical lower ball swivel  1590 , such that lower ball swivel  1590  is slidably retained within lower casing  1580 . Lower ball swivel  1590  defines a hole  1595  (see  FIG. 19 ) centrally therethrough for receiving a smooth lower connector pin  1596  about which lower ball swivel  1590  freely rotates in the x-plane. Connector pin  1596  also interconnects lower ball swivel  1590  to lower frame member  1484  and to a lower tool member  1610  as will be explained hereinafter in greater detail. In this manner, lower ball swivel  1590  is capable of multi-directional, slidable movement within lower casing  1580 . In other words, lower ball swivel  1590  is capable of side-to-side, rotational, or swivel movement in the horizontal x-axis plane as illustrated by previously mentioned directional arrow  1577  (see  FIG. 12 ). As described fully hereinbelow, it will be appreciated that ball swivels  1570 / 1590  will rotate in unison and to a like extent due to their interconnection by means of the upper tool member  1600 , the lower tool member  1610  and a pivot pin  1620  (see  FIGS. 12 ,  15 ,  16  and  19 ). Lower tool member  1610  includes a hole  1625  for reasons provided hereinbelow.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0085]    Still referring to  FIGS. 15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18  and  19 , to provide hand tool  1450  with the functionality noted hereinabove, hand tool  1450  further includes a tool head assembly, generally referred to as  1630 , for clipping fingernails and toe nails of the user of hand tool  1450 . In other words, tool head assembly  1630 , which is coupled to handle assembly  1460  by means of coupler assembly  1510 , is capable of operating on (i.e., clipping) the fingernails and toe nails (i.e., the work piece) of the user in response to hand manipulation of handle assembly  1460 , as described in detail presently. In this regard, tool head assembly  1630  generally includes the upper tool member or upper jaw  1600  and the lower tool member or lower jaw  1610 . Upper tool member  1600  and lower tool member  1610  are both disposed in the y-axis plane, lower tool member  1610  being oriented opposite to and coincident with upper tool member  1600 . Lower tool member  1610  and upper tool member  1600  are pivotably interconnected by previously mentioned pivot pin  1620  that is sized to be received in previously mentioned hole  1625 , such as by a press fit. Thus, the pivotable interconnection of lower tool member  1610  and upper tool member  1600  allow lower tool member  1610  and upper tool member  1600  to pivot about pivot pin  1620 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0086]    Referring again to  FIGS. 15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18  and  19 , upper tool member  1600  has an inwardly-curved first cutting edge portion  1640 . Similarly, lower tool member  1610  has an inwardly curved second cutting edge portion  1650 . Fingernails and toe nails of the user are clipped or cut when cutting edge portions  1640 / 1650  are brought to bear against each other in the manner described hereinabove.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        Illustrative Methods:  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0087]    An illustrative method associated with an exemplary embodiment for manufacturing the hand tool will now be described.  </p>
