                        <p>  SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent N0. 695,342, dated March 11, 1902.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Application filed November 1,1901. Serial No. 80,815. (No model.)   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Be it known that I, I/VILLARD SALISBURY REED,&#39;a citizen of the United States, residing at Smyrna, in the county of Kent and State of Delaware, have made certain new and useful Improvements in lVIanicure-Knives, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Myinvention is an improved manicure implement designed for use in cutting, trimming, filing, scraping, cleaning, and otherwise caring for the nails of the fingers and toes; and the invention consists in certain novel constructions, as will be hereinafter described and claimed.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the drawings, Figure 1 is a side view of my implement with the tile and ordinary blade open. Fig. 1 is a detail cross-section on about line a; m of Fig. 1. Fig. 2 is a crosssectional view on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> about lines 2</span> 2 of Figs. 1 and 3. Fig. 3 is a partial longitudinal section of the implement. Fig. 4 is a detail perspective view of one end of the handle. Fig. 5 is a detail perspective view of the rotary cutter and its shaft. Fig. 6 is a detail perspective View of the liners. Fig. 7 is a detail perspective View of the screw for securing the cutter-bar. Fig. 8 is a detail perspective view of the cutter-bar. Fig. 9 is a detail perspective View of one of the antifriction-rollers. Fig. 10 is a detail perspective View of the locking-key. Fig. 11 is adetail elevation of the butt-end of the implement on an enlarged scale.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The handle A is provided at one end with the blades B and O and is constructed at its other end to support the rotary cutter and the parts which cooperate therewith, as will be more fully described hereinafter. The blade B is an ordinary knife-blade and, like the blade 0, may be secured in the handle A.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  and springactuated in the ordinary manner. The blade 0 is of a special construction, having file-surfaces O on its opposite sides and provided at its outer extremity with a portion 0 which operates as a nail-cleaner and is separated by a slot 0 from a portion 0, which is formed as a lifter for lifting up or pressing back the flesh and skin at the root of the nail, as is desired in the lnanicuring operation. The outer edge of the blade 0 at C is curved in a concave line and sharpened or brought to an edge to adapt it for use in B and 0 formed to support the rotary cutter which is used for trimming the nails. To this end I form such handle with a recess D in its extremity, from which extends longitudinally inward a bore or opening E, which receives the shaft F of the cutter F. The recess D is open at its lower edge at D, and the bore E is intersected slightly in advance of its rear end by a channel G, in which is inserted the key II for the purpose of locking the cuttershaft F in place, as shown in Fig. 8. The outer surface of the handle surrounding the cutter F is rounded from side to side, as shown at A in Fig. 4, and slopes gradually upward toward its outer end, as shown at A in Figs. 1 and 3, thus forming a guard for the cutter F and the abutment for the forefinger of the hand holding the knife in operating upon the nails. On its inner side the handle is provided with a projecting portion I, which lies between the lateral shoulders a on the handle A and is spaced at its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> end 1</span>&#39; back from the outer end of the hub portion .I, providing a shoulder a. The inner end of the lug or projection I is adapted at t&#34; to form a seat for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71"> head 71</span> of the locking-key H, and the threaded opening is provided at i for the screw K, which secures the cutter-bar to its place, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The cutter has its shaft provided near its inner end with a groove f, which is entered by the bifurcated end h of the locking-key H and is provided with the outwardly-facing shoulder f adjacent to the groove f, which shoulder f forms in connection with the rotary cutter F an annular groove in which is seated the antifriction-rollers L. (SeeFigs. 2 and 3.) In practice the portions of the shaft lying on opposite sides of the groove f are made smaller than the bore E in the end of the handle, so there will be no friction between the said shaft and the handle; but the shaft will be borne entirely by the antifriction-rollers, as will be understood from Figs. 2 and The cutter-bar M is of a special construction, having the hollow or mortise M, which fits over the lug or projection I, and has the side flanges M which lap on opposite sides of said projection or lug I, and the end flange M which stands in operation in frontof the outer end of the said lug I. This cutter-bar has the opening M for the screw K, which opening is elongated longitudinally, so the cutter-bar can be adjusted in such direction to take up wear in the use of the device, as will be presently described. At its rear end the cutter-bar overlies the key H and locks the same in position, as shown in Fig. 3, and at the outer end of the said cutter-bar there is formed the neck N, which supports the point N, whose sides slope gradually, as shown in Fig. 8, and thus aid in guiding the nail into contact with the rotary cutter. It will also be noticed that the outer extremity of the cutter-bar at N is square to prevent the implement from cutting into the quick, such end N forming a stop to limit the movement of the rotary cutter toward the flesh. The neck N, as will be understood from Figs. 1 and 8, provides a throat which opens at the opposite sides of theimplement (seenin Fig. 3) and forms an outlet for the cut portion of the nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  WVithin the recessed portion of the cutter-bar M and between the cutter-bar and the lug I, I arrange a suitable number of thin plates or liners O, which operate as washers to space the cutter bar away from the cutter and which can be removed from time to time as the parts wear to take up wear and insure the proper adjustment of the cutter-bar to the cutter at all times.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In adjusting the parts to position for use-it will be understood that the rotary cutter D has its shaft, with the rollers L applied, inserted in the bore E until the cutter F lies within the recess D, as shown in Fig. 3, and projects at its inner edge beyond the side walls d of such recess, which slope rearwardly, as   </p>
                    
                        <p>   shown in Figs. 3 and 4:. The groove f will then lie opposite the channel G, and the key II will then be inserted to the position shown in Fig. 3, in which it will fit within the groove f and operate to prevent an ylengthwise movement of the cutter F and its shaft. Said cutter will then be held within the handle and will be supported so itcan turn within the antifriction rollers, thus relieving friction and rendering the rotation of the cutter very easy. The cutter-bar will then be applied, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, and held by the screw K with the liners O in place, which liners can be removed from time to time as desired. When so applied, the cutter-bar will overlie the key H at its inner end, and thus lock said key in place. At its outer end the cutter-bar will cooperate with the cutter F and will also operate as a stop to prevent cutting into the quick of the finger or toe. It will be noticed the rotary cutter F is of concavo-convex form with the concave face outward and the convex face on its inner side, such convex face forming a shoulder opposite the shoulder f and retaining the rollers L at the outer ends of said rollers. In operation the finger is applied as shown in Fig. 3 and the cutter will roll around from side to side and trim the nail ofi close, and yet will be prevented from cutting into the quick. It will&#39;be noticed from the foregoing that the cutter-bar operates below the nail and the rotary cutter above, with the cutter-bar holding the nail to the knife and aiding in the cutting operation. The concave face of the knife or cutter F operates close to or against the face of &#39;the cutter-bar at a (see Figs. 1 and 3) and against the nail which is being trimmed, and it will be seen that the knife F fits itself to the nail and will turn arou nd the smallest or roundest nail without pulling upon the nail or running off of same and will so travel until the knife has cut the entire nail across or around the end of the nail. The convex side of the knife turns against the portion of the nail which is being cut off and turns such portion of the nail off downward over&#39;the cutter-bar or into the throat or opening at 01, allowing the knife to cut through the nail very easily and at the same time permitting the knife to turn around the end of the smallest nail, as before stated. This knife F is self-sharpening, its shape being such as to cause its concave side, which runs against the face of the cutter-bar and working and rubbing against such cutterbar with sufficient force to wear the knife sharp as fast as the cutting of the nail dulls it. By reason of the convex side of the knife as the knife is cutting through the nail the cut nail forces the concave side of the knife against the face of the cutter-bar and aids in keeping the knife sharp, as desired;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As best shown in Fig. 3, the handle is&#39;provided with asolid wall atP between the&#39;channel G and the bore E and the recesses Q for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> blades 13</span> and C, so no dirt or dust can get from the blade-recesses into the operating portions at&#39;the butt-end of the handle; I also show in Fig. 3 the ends of the springs for actuating the blade 0; but as such springs may be of the ordinary construction they need not be described in detail herein.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having thus described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is-   </p>
