As will be explained hereinafter in greater detail, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">hand tool  10</span>  is provided with an interchangeable detachable tool which is ergonomically designed to provide a user with a substantial leverage advantage when cutting, clipping or gripping depending upon the type of tool employed. Moreover, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">hand tool  10</span>  is designed to provide a user with a variable angle of attack over a range of about one hundred and eighty degrees or extending at least ninety degrees to the right and at least ninety degrees to the left.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0017]    Considering now the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">hand tool  10</span>  in greater detail with reference to  FIGS. 1 and 8 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">hand tool  10</span>  generally includes a hand held tool mount indicated generally at  12  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">detachable or replaceable leverage tool  14</span> . In the present preferred embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">leverage tool  14</span>  is illustrated as a nail clipper. However, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">tool  14</span>  may without limitation include a pincher, a plier, a gripper, a cutter and a chipper. Therefore there is no limitation relative to the type of leverage tool that may be mounted to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">hand held tool mound  12</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0018]    As best seen in  FIGS. 5-7 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">replaceable tool  14</span>  is adapted to be mounted to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">tool mount  12</span>  for both x-axis and y axis motions so as to provide a user (not shown) with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">tool  14</span>  having a variable angle of attack and which can be engaged in a tool operation with substantial leverage. In this manner the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">hand tool  10</span>  allows ease of use by the aged and arthritic and otherwise handicapped whether they are left handed or right handed. More specifically the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">tool mount  12</span>  enables the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">tool  14</span>  to be rotated, by the user, in incremental steps in a horizontal or x-plane axis of rotation of between about 0 degrees to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90"> about 90</span> degrees either to the right or to the left as best seen in  FIG. 5 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">tool mount  14</span>  also enables the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">tool  14</span>  to open and close with a substantial power ratio of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> about 10</span>:1 extending from the distal end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">tool mount  12</span>  to the distal end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">tool  14</span>  as best seen in  FIGS. 6-7 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]    To provide the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">hand tool  10</span>  with the advantages as noted-above, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">hand held tool mount  12</span>  generally includes an upper tool mount indicated generally at  16  and a lower tool mount indicated generally at  18 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">upper tool mount  16</span>  is coupled to an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span>  having a generally smooth arcuate shape to facilitate ease in gripping. In a like manner, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lower tool mount  18</span>  is coupled to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle member  22</span>  also having a generally smooth arcuate shape. As will be explained hereinafter in greater detail, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle member  22</span>  are secured to together to allow a pivoting action in the y-axis plane as best seen in FIGS.  6 - 7 . That is, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle member  22</span>  are adapted to pivot toward and away from one another as the user grips the handles within his or her hand and squeezes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">respective handle members  20</span>  and  22  together. In order to help facilitate providing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">handle members  20</span>  and  22  respectively with a return action when the squeezing force applied by the user is removed, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">hand tool  10</span>  is further provided with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">handle compression spring  24</span>  which is mounted between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle member  22</span>  as best seen in  FIGS. 6-7 . This pivoting action in the y-axis plane permits the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">leverage tool  14</span>  to open and close to effect a user selected tool action or tool operation.  </p>

It is contemplated however, that in modifying the preferred embodiment of the present invention, that the upper and lower tool mounts,  16  and  18  respectively, could also be secured to their <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">respective handle members  20</span>  and  22  by other conventional securing or mounting means such as by compression via a bolt and nut or by using high strength adhesives.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]    Considering now the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">replaceable leverage tool  14</span>  in greater detail with reference to  FIGS. 1 and 8 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">tool  14</span>  generally includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  are mounted together for pivotal movement about a pivot axis defined by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">mounting bolt  27</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  and lower tool member are also spring loaded by tool spring means indicated generally at  29  as best seen in  FIG. 8 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">spring means  29</span>  in the preferred embodiment generally includes a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">spaced apart compression springs  29</span> A and  29 B respectively which are mounted in spring mount cutouts, such as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">cutouts  29</span> C and  29 D disposed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span> . A similar set of cutouts (not shown) are disposed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">compression springs  29</span> A and  29 B are disposed between the tool members to cause the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  to return to a non-object engaging position when an object engaging force applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">tool  14</span>  has been released. Although in the preferred embodiment a pair of compression springs has been utilized, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that other suitable spring means may be utilized, such as a single compression spring and other suitable compression spring means.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  is adapted to be mounted to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">upper tool mount  16</span>  to effect movement both in the x-axis plane and the y-axis plane. In a similar manner, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  is adapted to be mounted to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lower tool mount  18</span>  to effect movement both in the x-axis plane and the y-axis plane. As will be explained hereinafter in greater detail, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  rotate simultaneously in the horizontal or x-axis plane to a user selected rotational angle for effecting a user selected tool operation. The user selected rotational angle is available in increments of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> between 1</span> degree and 90 degrees. A more preferred incremental angle is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> between 1</span> degree and 30 degrees, and the most preferred incremental angle is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> about 1</span> degree. Based on the foregoing it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">hand tool  10</span>  provides a user with a tool having a variable angle of attack and with substantial leverage allowing ease of tool use by aged, arthritic and otherwise handicapped people whether they are left handed or right handed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]    The method of effecting a tool operation on a user select object (not shown) includes the steps of providing the user with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">hand held tool mount  12</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">tool  14</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">tool mount  12</span>  in this case includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">upper tool mount  16</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lower tool mount  18</span> , while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">tool  14</span>  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span> . Next, the user mounts simultaneously, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  to their respective mounts or more particularly to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">upper tool mount  16</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lower tool mount  18</span>  respectively. More specifically, the user squeezes the distal ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  together causing the proximal ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  to open away from one another a sufficient distance to allow the proximal ends to be aligned with respective ones of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">upper tool mount  16</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lower tool mount  18</span> . In this regard, when alignment is achieved, the user releases the distal ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  allowing the compression force of the return springs to hold the proximal ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  respectively to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">upper tool mount  16</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lower tool mount  18</span>  as best seen in  FIG. 6 . It should be understood by those skilled in the art, that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle  22</span>  must not be squeezed together during this mount operation of mounting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">leverage tool  14</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">tool mount  12</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    Next the user rotates simultaneously the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  in a horizontal or x-axis plane a sufficient distance to reach a user selected rotational or attack angle. The attack angle in the preferred method of the present invention is between<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90"> about 90</span> degrees to the right and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90"> about 90</span> degrees to the left in incremental steps in either direction of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> about 1</span> degree.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]    Next, the user pivots simultaneously the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  in a vertical or y-axis plane by pivoting or squeezing simultaneously the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle  22</span>  over a sufficient distance to effect the tool operation selected by the user. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">replaceable leverage tool  14</span>  selected by the user is achieved by the user selecting from a group of tools consisting of a cutter, a gripper, a pliers and a chipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]    Considering now the power or leverage advantage provided by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">hand tool  10</span>  in greater detail with reference to  FIG. 6 , it can be seen that a user can apply a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> hand force F 1</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle member  22</span>  by squeezing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">handle members  20</span>  and  22  toward one another as best seen in  FIG. 7 . This<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> force F 1</span>  is translated to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">upper tool mount  16</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lower tool mount  18</span>  as a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> translated force F 2</span> , where the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> force F 2</span>  is defined by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> equation 1</span> as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> follow<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">s:  </p>

                        <p>          [0000]    The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> translated force F 2</span>  is then translated to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  respectively as another<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> translated force F 3</span> , where the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> force F 3</span>  is defined by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> equation 2</span> as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> follow<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">s:  </p>

                        <p>          [0027]    As an illustrative example of the mechanical leverage achieved consider the follow:  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]    Assume the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> applie<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">d force F 1</span>  equals 1</span> pound and the dimensions of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> D 1</s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pan> -D 4</span>  are as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> fol<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lows: </p>

                        <p>          [0000] <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">     Then  F 2</span>=(1 pound)(4</span>.00 inches)/(0.50 inc<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">hes)=8.0 pounds  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0000]        F 3</span>=(8.0 pounds)(0.75 inches)/(0.60 inches)=10.0 pounds  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0033]    Thereby, it can be seen that at least a 10:1 leverage advantage is derived.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0034]    Considering now the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">compression spring  24</span>  in greater detail with reference to  FIG. 8 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">compression spring  24</span>  has a unitary construction that includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">central straight segment portion  66</span> , which is disposed between an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">upper straight portion  66</span> A and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">lower rounded or curved end portion  66</span> B. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">upper straight portion  66</span> A is disposed at a slight angle to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">central segment portion  66</span>  and terminates in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem67">rounded or curved end portion  67</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0035]    Considering now the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">hand held tool mount  12</span>  in still greater detail, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle member  22</span>  are elongate arcuate lever arms which are pivotally linked with each other via a linkage arrangement indicated generally at  30 . More particularly, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle member  22</span>  are mounted to each other on an axis defined by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">mount or linkage bolt  74</span>  and are held apart from one another by th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">e elongate compression or handle spring  24</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">linkage bolt  74</span>  facilitates holding the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">two handle members  20</span>  and  22  pivotally together as will be explained hereinafter in greater detail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0036]    In order to hold the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">handle members  20</span>  and  22  apart, one end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">elongate compression spring  24</span>  is mounted within a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">lower handle member cutout  68</span>  and is secured within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">cutout  68</span>  by a mounting or spring pin indicated generally at  69 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">cutout  68</span>  is disposed at about an inner rearward surface area of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle  22</span>  in order to allow the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">spring  24</span>  to be disposed at an inclined angle between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle member  22</span>  as best seen in  FIGS. 6-7  of the drawings. The opposite end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">compression spring  24</span>  which terminates in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem67">rounded or curved end portion  67</span>  permits the opposite or curved end portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">compression spring  24</span>  to rest in engagement with an inner surface area of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span> . In short, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">compression spring  24</span>  is wedged between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle member  22</span>  to provide a return force when the two handle members are squeezed together as best seen in  FIG. 7 . This return force is a sufficient force to cause the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">two handle members  20</span>  and  22  to move pivotally away from one another about the axis defined by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">mounting bolt  74</span>  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">handle members  20</span>  and  22  are released by the user so they return to their non object engaging positions as best seen in  FIG. 6 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0037]    Considering now the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">upper tool mount  16</span>  in greater detail with reference to  FIG. 8 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">upper tool mount  16</span>  as noted earlier is coupled to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span> . In this regard, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">upper tool mount  16</span>  generally includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">elongate bar like extender  32</span>  which is attached by one of its ends to a proximal end portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span> . The opposite end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">extender  32</span>  is attached to an upright <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">hollow half sphere or upper ball member  36</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">upper ball member  36</span>  is adapted to be received within an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">upper tool socket  70</span>  integrally formed within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span> . The ball and socket arrangement between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">upper ball member  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">upper tool socket  70</span>  enables the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  to freely rotate in the x-axis plane relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">upper ball member  36</span>  as best seen in  FIG. 5 . In this regard, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">extender  32</span>  has a sufficient longitudinal dimension to space the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span>  so that there is frictional free rotational movement there between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span> . Stated otherwise, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span>  does not make physical contact with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0038]    In order to facilitate mounting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  onto the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">ball member  36</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">ball member  36</span>  has disposed at its upper pole area an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">aperture or hole  40</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">hole  40</span>  is dimensioned for receiving therethrough a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">threaded pin or bolt  42</span>  ( FIG. 5 ). As will be explained hereinafter in greater detail, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">mounting pin  42</span>  is threadably received within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  and onto an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">upper mounting nut  44</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">upper mounting nut  44</span>  is dimensioned to be received within the hollow interior of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">ball member  36</span>  for removably securing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">upper tool mount  16</span> . More particularly, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">mounting pin  42</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">mounting nut  44</span>  cooperate together to secure the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">ball member  26</span>  for rotational movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  about the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">half sphere member  36</span>  as best seen in  FIG. 5 . Although in the preferred embodiment of the present invention there is disclosed a mounting pin which is threadably received within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span> , it is contemplated that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">mounting pin  42</span>  could also be integ<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">rally attached within upper tool socket  70</span>  for mounting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper tool member  26</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">upper tool mount  16</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0039]    Considering now the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lower tool mount  18</span>  in greater detail with reference to  FIG. 8 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lower tool mount  18</span>  as noted earlier is coupled to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle member  22</span> . In this regard, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lower tool mount  18</span>  generally includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">elongate bar like lower extender  52</span>  which is attached or secured by one of its ends to a proximal end portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle member  22</span> . The opposite end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">extender  52</span>  is secured or attached to an inverted <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">hollow half sphere or lower ball member  56</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">lower ball member  56</span>  is adapted to be received within a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90">lower tool socket  90</span>  integrally formed within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span> . The ball and socket arrangement between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">lower ball member  56</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90">lower tool socket  90</span>  enables the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  to freely rotate in the x-axis plane relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">lower ball member  56</span>  as best seen in  FIG. 4 . In this regard, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">extender  52</span>  has a sufficient longitudinal dimension to space the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle member  22</span>  so that there is frictional free rotational movement therebetween the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle member  22</span> . Stated otherwise, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle member  22</span>  does not make physical contact with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0040]    In order to facilitate mounting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  onto the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">ball member  56</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">ball member  56</span>  has disposed at its lower pole area an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">aperture or hole  60</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">hole  60</span>  is dimensioned for receiving there through a thr<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">eaded alignment or mounting pin or bolt  62</span> . As will be explained hereinafter in greater detail, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">mounting pin  62</span>  is threadably received within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  and onto a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">lower mounting nut  64</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">lower mounting nut  64</span>  is dimensioned to be received within the hollow interior of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">ball member  56</span>  for removably securing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lower tool mount  18</span> . More particularly, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">mounting pin  62</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">mounting nut  64</span>  cooperate together to secure the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">ball member  56</span>  for rotational movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  about the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">half sphere member  56</span>  as best seen in  FIG. 4 . Although in the preferred embodiment of the present invention there is disclosed a mounting pin which is threadably received within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span> , it is contemplated that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">mounting pin  62</span>  could also be integ<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90">rally attached within lower tool socket  90</span>  for mounting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower tool member  28</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lower tool mount  18</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0041]    Considering now the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">linkage arrangement  30</span>  in greater detail with reference to  FIG. 8 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">linkage arrangement  30</span>  is partially disposed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span>  and partially disposed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle member  22</span> . In this regard at about the proximal end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span>  and adjacent to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">upper extender  32</span>  is a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">circular like upper handle protuberance  76</span>  having a centrally disposed hole which is dimensioned for receiving therein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">linkage bolt  74</span> . At about the proximal end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle member  22</span>  and disposed adjacent to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lower extender  52</span>  are a pair of spaced apart upstan<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">ding circular like protuberance members  78</span>  and  79  respectively which form a saddle for receiving therein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">upper handle protuberance  76</span> . That is, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">upper handle protuberance  76</span>  is received between th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">e two lower handle protuberance members  78</span>  and  79  which helps to hold the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">upper handle protuberance  76</span>  therebetween for pivotal movement. In order to help facilitate securing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">protuberance members  76</span> ,  78  and  79  together for relative pivotal movement, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">protuberance member  78</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">centrally disposed cutout  80</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">cutout  80</span>  is dimensioned for receiving therein a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">head portion  74</span> A of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">linkage bolt  74</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">Each respective protuberance member  78</span>  and  79  has disposed therein a threaded hole or aperture such as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem83">hole  83</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">linkage bolt  74</span>  is dimensioned to be threadably received within the protuberance holes, while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">head  74</span> A of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">linkage bolt  74</span>  is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">held within cutout  80</span> . In this manner therefore, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">bolt  74</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">nut  84</span>  cooperate with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper handle member  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower handle member  22</span>  to hold the two handle members together for pivotal movement abut their respective protuberance members.  </p>
