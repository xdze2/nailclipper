                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A nail clipping assembly holds a pair of conventional nail clippers in a holder. The holder can also support a light source which is positioned close enough to a subject&#39;s finger tip to illuminate the interior of the finger tip. This exposes the intersection between a finger nail which is part of a finger and the exposed nail portion, some or all of which will be cut by the nail clippers. </p>

                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]     The field of the invention is nail clippers and the invention relates more particularly to an improvement to nail clippers which utilizes a source of light to illuminate the interior of the tip of a subject&#39;s finger. A problem exists especially with the cutting of an infant&#39;s or toddler&#39;s finger nails. The infant or toddler tends to pull away and move in such a way that it is very difficult to accomplish a nail clipping operation. It has been recommended that an infant&#39;s or toddler&#39;s nails be clipped while the infant or toddler is sleeping. The main difficulties in this approach is that it is typically dark when the infant is sleeping and turning on a light wakes the child.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]     Even in a brightly illuminated area, the intersection between the portion of the nail which extends beyond the subject&#39;s finger and that which is still part of the subject&#39;s finger is sometimes difficult to see. Several attempts have been made to illuminate the area of the cutting end of a nail end of a nail clipper. One such device is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,553,592, where a pair of LEDs is held outwardly from the end of the nail clipper to illuminate a target place. Another patent showing a light to illuminate the cutting area is U.S. Pat. No. 6,220,251. This device also has a magnifying glass and the light is provided by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> LED 34</span>. The light and the magnifying glass assist in the viewing of the nail clipping area whether it be for a pet or a human.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]     By placing the light at a significant distance from the finger nail, the result is the illumination of the exterior surface of the finger tip and nail. Such lighting does not emphasize the line between the finger nail over the finger and the extending part of the finger nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0005]     The present invention is for a nail clipping assembly including a pair of nail clippers. A light source is held near the upper and lower blades of the nail clippers and positioned so that when a finger is moved so that the nail to be cut is between the blades of the nail cutter, the light source will illuminate the interior of the finger under its nail so that an intersection between the extending portion of the nail and the finger is clearly visible. Preferably, the pair of nail clippers is held in a holder which has a recess for supporting the nail clippers and which also holds batteries and a light bulb or LED. Preferably, the holder has a finger nail guide extending just below the upper blade of the nail clippers. In this way, a subject&#39;s finger nail can be raised upwardly until it contacts the finger nail guides and then moved forwardly into the space between the cutting blades of the nail clippers. The present invention also includes the ergonomic handle for holding the nail clippers so that the nail clippers can be supported by the user&#39;s palm and fingers instead of just between the fingers, as is done for conventional nail clippers.  </p>

                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0015]     A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipping assembly  10</span>  is shown in perspective view in  FIG. 1 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">Assembly  10</<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">span>  holds conventional nail clippers  11</span>  in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">recess  12</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">Recess  12</span>  has <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">side edges  13</span>  and  14  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">back edge  15</span> . Since most conventional nail clippers have a hole near the joined ends of the nail clipper, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">tab  16</span>  will extend upwardly from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">bottom or floor  17</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">recess  12</span>  and pass through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">hole  18</span>  in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">nail clippers  11</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0016]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">nail clippers  11</span>  are preferably conventional nail clippers. Such clippers have an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">upper arm  19</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">lower arm  20</span> . These arms are joined at <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">joined ends  21</span>  typically by a rivet not shown. As is well known, these arms are joined in a way so that an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">upper blade  22</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">lower blade  23</span>  are spaced apart at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">blade end  24</span>  of the nail clippers are spaced apart. An <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">operating lever  25</span>  moves the upper arm downwardly so that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">upper blade  22</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">lower blade  23</span>  contact one another, thereby cutting a finger nail which has been inserted between them.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0017]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">handle  27</span>  is useful as part of the assembly of the present invention for several reasons. First of all, it makes it much easier to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">hold nail clippers  11</span> . This is especially useful when trying to cut an infant&#39;s finger nails where positioning of the nail clipper is critical. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">Handle  27</span>  also can function to support a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">light source  26</span> , such as a light bulb or LED and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">battery  28</span> , as well as associated wiring and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">switch  29</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">Handle  27</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">hand graspable portion  30</span>  which is large enough to support a user&#39;s fingers on one side and palm on the other side. This frees the user&#39;s thumb for operation of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">operating lever  25</span>  in a very comfortable manner. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">hand graspable handle  30</span>  preferably extends upwardly as shown at <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">reference character  41</span>  in  FIG. 2 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">Handle  30</span>  is preferably injection molded and has provisions for opening for replacement of the battery or bulb/LED.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0018]      FIG. 3  shows a user holding the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">handle  27</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">user&#39;s right hand  52</span>  and holding a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">subject&#39;s finger  53</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">user&#39;s left hand  54</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">subject&#39;s finger nail  33</span>  is positioned with the aid of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">guides  37</span>  and  38 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]     An important feature of the present invention is the presence of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">light source  26</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">Light source  26</span>  performs a very different function from the light sources shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,553,592 and 6,220,251. That is, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">light source  26</span>  is placed close enough to the finger tip to illuminate the inner portion of the finger tip so that it glows with an orange glow causing the nail ledge to appear dark in color. Most everyone is familiar with the effect of placing a flashlight under the palm of one&#39;s hand at night and turning it on. This causes one&#39;s hand to glow orange. This same effect is accomplished by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">light source  26</span>  if it is placed near or touching the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">tip  31</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">finger  32</span> . By the term “near” it is intended to mean a small fraction of an inch such as ⅛ of an inch or less. The finger nail is indicated by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">reference character  33</span>  in  FIG. 5  and that portion of the finger nail which extends beyond the subject&#39;s finger is indicated by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">reference character  34</span> . When the light source is placed to cause the finger tip to glow orange, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">intersection  35</span>  between that portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">finger nail  33</span>  over the subject&#39;s finger and the extending part of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">nail  34</span>  appears much darker and is highly visible. Therefore, the finger nails can be easily and precisely cut in dim light or even in darkness. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">Light source  26</span>  guides the nail clippers to an appropriate position over the finger nail and once in position, lights the inner portion of the finger tip to facilitate the positioning of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting line  36</span>  between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">upper blade  22</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">lower blade  23</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]     When used to cut the finger nails of an infant or toddler, the device of the present invention, when using a light source near the finger tip, permits the caregiver to cut the infant&#39;s or toddler&#39;s finger nails at night in dimly lit conditions while the infant or toddler is sleeping without the necessity of turning on the room light or providing any other source of external light. While the above discussion has used the word “finger,” it is to be understood that the device can equally be used on toenails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]     Another important feature of the present invention is the presence of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">finger nail guides  37</span>  and  38 . These guides have <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">under surfaces  39</span>  and  40 , as shown in  FIG. 4 , which are aligned slightly below the lower edge of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">upper blade  23</span> . In this way, as shown best in  FIG. 3 , a subject&#39;s finger nail can be brought upwardly until it contacts the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">under surfaces  39</span>  and  40  and then moved inwardly toward the cutting edges until the clipper is in a desired position. Preferably, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">finger nail guides  37</span>  and  38  are separated so that most of the extending part  34  of the finger nail is visible.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]     The orientation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">light source  26</span>  is not critical as long as it causes the finger tip to glow orange in subdued light. It may be aligned outwardly from the tip of the finger shown in  FIG. 5  or positioned at an angle as shown in  FIG. 5A . It could also be placed under the finger as shown in  FIG. 5B . It is easy to determine in subdued light whether light placement causes the finger to glow orange or simply lights the external part of the finger. It is generally preferable that the light be below the level of the finger nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]     An alternate embodiment of the nail clipping assembly is shown in  FIG. 7  and indicated by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">reference character  42</span> . This embodiment has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">handle  43</span>  including a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">wafer b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">attery  44</span>  enclosure  45</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">switch  46</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">bulb or LED  47</span>  is covered with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">lens  48</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem49">nail clippers  49</span>  include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">finger rest  50</span>  on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">operating lever  51</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">Bulb  47</span>  is aimed toward a finger tip at a 45° angle.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]     While the device has been shown and described with the presence of a light, the hand graspable handle itself is useful even if the light is not turned on or not used. The ease with which the nail clippers can be positioned is greatly enhanced by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">handle  26</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]     The present embodiments of this invention are thus to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive; the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are intended to be embraced therein. </p>
