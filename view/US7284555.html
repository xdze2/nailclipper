                        <p> A manicuring implement includes a shaft and an operative head arranged at an end of the shaft and having first and second fixed jaws defining an indentation therebetween. The first jaw has a straight inner surface forming one side of the indentation and an outer surface having a straight portion on an opposite side. The second jaw has a curved inner surface forming the other side of the indentation and an outer surface having a curved portion on an opposite side. By forming the straight and curved portions on the outer surfaces of the jaws, a manicurist can readily determine the orientation of the implement and use the implement to cause either the straight or curved jaw to be inserted between the nail and the underlying skin to clean the underside of the nail. The indentation serves to limit the penetration of the jaws below the nail into the underlying skin and nail bed. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The present invention relates to a manicure implement for cleaning underneath a person&#39;s nails, and to manicure instruments including such an implement.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The present invention also relates to a manicure instrument which enables both cleaning underneath a person&#39;s nails as well as finishing the nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    When manicuring nails, various implements are used each having a different purpose, e.g., nail and cuticle trimming, brushing, and finishing processes such as coarse buffing, polishing and smooth buffing. In addition, a pick is often used to clean accumulated particulate matter from the area between the nail and the skin of the underlying part of the finger. The pick is inserted between the underside of the nail and the adjacent skin and scraped along the underside of the nail to thereby force the expulsion of any accumulated matter from below the nail. Such picks typically have an elongate body terminating at a pointed head region.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    One problem with using such a pick to clean underneath nails is that there is no limitation on the depth to which the pick can be inserted into the area between the nail and the skin. As such, it is quite common for the pick to be over-inserted and puncture the nail bed causing bleeding, discomfort and the possibility of infection. The problem is prevalent with inexperienced manicurists and persons who manicure their own nails. It would therefore be desirable to provide a manicure implement as a replacement for a pick which inherently limits the depth to which the implement can penetrate into the area below the nail to thereby avoid puncturing the nail bed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Another concern for manicurists and self-manicurists is that several implements are used during the course of a manicure. Each implement must be independently handled during the manicure and put down after use. As more implements are used, the handling thereof increases and thus fingernail maintenance can become a time-consuming activity. Moreover, implements can be misplaced.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    To reduce the number of implements required to provide a complete manicure and thus time-consuming handling thereof, attempts have been made to provide a single instrument which has two or more different manicuring implements formed in connection therewith or arranged thereon. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,088,509 (Savage, III) describes a manicure file kit with several different manicuring implements all of which are used in conjunction with an S-shaped file body. An implement for trimming cuticles has the form of a V-shaped gap defined between a pair of spaced blades at one end of a planar section of the file body. A cuticle is received in the V-shaped gap and the file body is manipulated to cause trimming of the cuticle in the gap. A file surface is provided at another planar section of the file body to enable rough filing of the nails. A cover sheath is slidable over a planar section of the file body and has a file surface with a lesser coarseness than that formed on the file body and enables smooth buffing of the nails. A brush is also slidable over a planar section of the file body and enables brushing over the nails. Using the file body, a user can accomplish several different processes in the manicure, and possibly the entire manicure, without having to put the file body down. A reduction in the time to perform nail maintenance using the file body is therefore obtained.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Other manicure instruments having multiple manicuring implements, such as nail clippers and a filing surface, are described in U.S. Pat. No. 1,828,121 (Adam et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 2,999,505 (Herstedt), U.S. Pat. No. 3,261,094 (Bliss), U.S. Pat. No. 3,315,354 (Oates, Jr.), U.S. Pat. No. 3,316,634 (Bliss), U.S. Pat. No. 5,666,728 (Silva) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,553,592 (Yang et al.). These instruments lack an implement which is designed to clean underneath nails while limiting the penetration thereof below the nails to avoid puncturing the nail bed and causing bleeding.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    It is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved manicuring implement, which may be used, for example, to clean underneath nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    It is another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved manicure instrument which has multiple implements attached thereto, one of which is a manicuring implement for cleaning underneath nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    It is another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved manicure instrument which has manicuring implements enabling cleaning underneath nails as well as finishing the nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved manicure instrument which provides an indication of an optimal order in which different filing surfaces are to be used.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    In order to achieve these objects and others, a manicuring implement in accordance with the invention includes a shaft and an operative head arranged at an end of the shaft and having first and second fixed jaws defining an indentation therebetween. The first jaw has a straight inner surface forming one side of the indentation and an outer surface having a straight portion on an opposite side. The second jaw has a curved inner surface forming the other side of the indentation and an outer surface having a curved portion on an opposite side. The formation of the straight and curved portions on the outer surfaces of the jaws enables a manicurist to readily determine the orientation of the implement and then use the implement to insert either the straight jaw or the curved jaw between the nail and the underlying skin to clean the underside of the nail. The presence of the indentation between the jaws serves to limit the penetration of the jaw being used for cleaning below the nail, into the underlying nail bed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The implement can be used as a stand-alone manicuring instrument or in a manicuring instrument with other manicuring implements. In one embodiment, a handle is provided to which the shaft of the implement is mounted. The manicurist grips the handle for use of the implement.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    For this instrument, a cover may be provided having files incorporated thereon. The cover includes a slot arranged to receive an exposed portion of the shaft and the head when the cover is arranged in connection with the handle. The cover can be designed to enable buffing, polishing, sanding and/or smoothing of the nails by providing different grade filing surfaces on sides thereof. An optimal order in which the filing surfaces are to be used can be provided by coloring the filing surfaces and aligning colored sides of the handle with the corresponding colored filing surfaces. The sides of the handle are numbered in the desired order for using the filing surfaces so that when the handle and cover are properly connected together with the same colors on the sides of the cover aligning with those on the handle, the order of use of the filing surfaces is provided by the numbers on the sides of the handle.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Another manicuring instrument including the manicuring implement described above includes upper and lower plates joined together at rear ends and defining opposing sharpened jaws at front ends. The manicuring implement is rotatably connected to the upper plate to swing outward from a storage position along the upper plate to an exposed, operative position. A lever is arranged to urge the jaw of the upper plate against the jaw of the lower plate to enable trimming of nails or cuticles. The lever rests in a storage position against the manicuring implement and to this end, the manicuring implement preferably includes upraised projections extending from edges, the lever being retainable in a storage position between the projections. Cushioning pads can be provided along the force-application surfaces of the lever and lower plate to improve the comfort of handling and using the manicuring instrument by, for example, reducing the abrasiveness of the hard metal surfaces of the lever and lower plate and reducing slipping of the manicurist&#39;s or self-manicurist&#39;s fingers along the lever and lower plate.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Another manicuring instrument including the manicuring implement described above includes upper and lower cheeks, and rivets or pivot pins for joining the upper and lower cheeks together at opposed ends. The manicuring implement is rotatably mounted to one of the rivets or pivot pins such that it is rotatable between a folded, storage position inside a gap between the upper and lower cheeks and an exposed, operational position extending outward from the upper and lower cheeks. Additional manicuring implements can be rotatably mounted to the rivets or pivot pins and rotatable between storage positions in the gap between the upper and lower cheeks and operational positions outside of the gap.  </p>
                    
                        <p>  </p>

                        <p>  </p>
                    
                        <p>    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Referring to the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numbers refer to the same or similar objects,  FIG. 1  shows a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">manicuring implement  10</span>  in accordance with the invention. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">Manicuring implement  10</span>  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">elongate shaft  12</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">substantially flat operative head  14</span>  at one end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">shaft  12</span> . The other end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">shaft  12</span>  may be mounted or attached to a handle or manicure instrument (described below). <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">Shaft  12</span>  may taper to the end having the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">head  14</span>  such that a middle portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">shaft  12</span>  is thicker than the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">head  14</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">Manicuring implement  10</span>  may be formed of a rigid, metal or plastic material. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> </p>
                    
                        <p>    Head  14</span>  has a particular construction effective to optimize the removal of particulate matter from underneath nails. Specifically, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">head  14</span>  includes a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">fixed jaws  16</span> ,  18  defining an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">indentation  20</span>  therebetween. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">Jaw  16</span>  is a straight-surface jaw in that its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">inner surface  22</span>  forming one side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">indentation  20</span>  is straight from a forward edge region of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">jaw  16</span>  to a back region of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">indentation  20</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">Jaw  18</span>  is a curved-surface jaw in that its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">inner surface  24</span>  forming the other side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">indentation  20</span>  is curved from a forward edge region of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">jaw  18</span>  to the back region of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">indentation  20</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">Inner surface  24</span>  is inwardly curved in the sense that a depression is formed between the forward edge and back regions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">jaw  18</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    To provide an indication as to which of the side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">indentation  20</span>  is straight or curved, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">outer surface  26</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">jaw  16</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">straight portion  28</span>  while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">outer surface  30</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">jaw  18</span> , or a significant portion thereof, is curved. This is important since the size of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">implement  10</span>  may be quite small so that it would be difficult to view the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">head  14</span>  and determine which jaw is straight and which is curved. By forming a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">straight portion  28</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">outer surface  26</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">jaw  16</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">straight inner surface  22</span>  and forming a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">curved outer surface  30</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">jaw  18</span>  with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">curved inner surface  24</span> , the manicurist can feel the outside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">jaws  16</span> ,  18  and determine which jaw is which and then use the desired jaw. Situations in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">which straight jaw  16</span>  would be preferably used and when <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">curved jaw  18</span>  would be preferably used are described below.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    For use of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">manicuring implement  10</span> , reference is now made to  FIG. 2  wherein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">straight jaw  16</span>  is inserted underneath a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">nail  32</span>  to a position between the underside of the nail and the skin of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">finger  34</span>  and moving the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">jaw  16</span>  with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">straight surface  22</span>  against the underside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">nail  32</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">Jaw  16</span>  thereby effects the removal of particulate matter from underneath the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">nail  32</span> . To improve the removal of particulate matter from underneath the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">nail  32</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">manicuring implement  10</span>  may be lightly push up against the underside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">nail  32</span>  and rolled from side-to-side, alternatingly right-to-left and left-to-right.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Alternatively, it is possible to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">use manicuring implement  10</span>  by inserting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">curv<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">ed jaw  18</span>  underneath each nail  32</span>  and moving the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">jaw  18</span>  along the underside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">nail  32</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">curved inner surface  24</span>  aids in moving the skin below the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">nail  32</span>  downward to avoid penetrating the nail bed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The depth of penetration of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">jaw  16<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"></span>  or jaw  18</span>  below the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">nail  32</span>  is limited by the depth of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">indentation  20</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">larger indentation  20</span>  will enable deeper penetration of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">jaws  16</span> ,  18  below the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">nail  32</span> . The depth of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">indentation  20</span>  can be optimized in consideration of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">typical extension  36</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">nail  32</span>  beyond the underlying skin to enable the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">manicuring implement  10</span>  to be optimally used by most people.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The use of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">straight jaw  16</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">curved jaw  18</span>  depends on various factors. For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">straight jaw  16</span>  will generally provide a greater depth of penetration than the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">curved jaw  18</span> , assuming the thickness of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">straight jaw  16</span>  is less than the thickness of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">curved jaw  18</span>  as shown in  FIG. 1 . Another factor is relevant when individuals manicure themselves. In this case, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">straight jaw  16</span>  is easier to use when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">manicuring implement  10</span>  is gripped by the person&#39;s strong hand, i.e., a right-handed person would use the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">straight jaw  16</span>  when holding the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">manicuring implement  10</span>  in his/her right hand and cleaning the nails on his/her left hand, while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">curved jaw  18</span>  would be easier to use when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">manicuring implement  10</span>  is gripped by the person&#39;s weak hand, i.e., a right-handed person would use the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">curved jaw  18</span>  when holding the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">manicuring implement  10</span>  in his/her left hand and cleaning the nails on his/her right hand.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    An additional use of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">manicuring implement  10</span>  is to remove dead cuticle skin. This may be achieved by lightly pushing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">straight portion  28</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">curved portion  30</span>  against the cuticle so that dead cuticle skin is torn as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">straigh<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">t portion  28</span>  or curved portion  30</span>  is moved along and over the underlying nail. Alternatively, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">manicuring implement  10</span>  can be positioned so that the cuticle is in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">indentation  20</span>  and the front edge of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">inner surface  22</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">straight jaw  16</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">inner surface  24</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">curved jaw  18</span>  is pushed against the cuticle so that dead cuticle skin is torn as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">jaw  16<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"></span>  or  18</span>  is moved along and over the underlying nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Referring now to  FIGS. 3 and 4 , a manicuring instrument which includes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">manicuring implement  10</span>  is designated generally as  40  and includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle  42</span>  to which the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">shaft  12</span>  opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">head  14</span>  is fixed. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">Handle  42</span>  may be made of plastic, rubber or other materials. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> </p>
                    
                        <p>    Manicuring instrument  40</span>  also includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">cover  44</span>  having the same cross-sectional shape as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle  42</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">Cover  44</span>  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">elongate slot  46</span>  (see  FIG. 4 ) which receives an exposed portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">shaft  12</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">operative head  14</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">implement  10</span>  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">cover  44</span>  is fully engaged with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle  42</span> . The cross-sectional shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">slot  46</span>  may be dimensioned to substantially conform to, or be only slightly larger than, the outer dimensions of the inserted portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">shaft  12</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">head  14</span>  to provide for a frictional engagement between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">shaft  12</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">head  14</span>  and the interior walls of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">slot  46</span> . This frictional engagement serves to prevent the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">cover  44</span>  from inadvertently sliding out of engagement with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle  42</span> . Alternatively, an attachment mechanism can be provided on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> 42</span>  and/or cover  44</span>  to removably connect the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle  42</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">cover  44</span>  together, e.g., strips of VelcroÂ® or an adhesive such as double-sided tape. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> </p>
                    
                        <p>    Each axially extending side  48</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">cover  44</span>  has a different filing surface. For example, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">sides  48</span>  can include a very coarse sanding surface, a buffing surface, a polishing surface and a smoothing surface. To readily facilitate identification of the different filing surfaces on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">sides  48</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">cover  44</span>  and the order in which the filing surfaces may be optimally used, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">sides  50</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle  42</span>  (or pads arranged on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">sides  50</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle  42</span> ) are <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">numbered  1</span> - 4  and colored the same colors as the colors of the filing surfaces on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">sides  48</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">cover  44</span> . Thus, when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">cover  44</span>  is mated with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle  42</span> , the colors on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">sides  50</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle  42</span>  are aligned with the colors of the filing surfaces on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">sides  48</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">cover  44</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Use of the filing surfaces on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">sides  48</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">cover  44</span>  can then proceed in the proper manner, when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">cover  44</span>  is engaged with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle  42</span> , by using the filing surface aligning with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">number  1</span>  on the side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle  42</span>  first, then the filing surface aligning with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">number  2</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle  42</span> , then the filing surface aligning with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">number  3</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle  42</span>  and finally the filing surface aligning with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">number  4</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle  42</span> . It is of course possible to deviate from the suggested order of use of the filing surfaces, if the manicurist deems it worthwhile.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    As the filing surfaces on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">sides  48</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">cover  44</span>  are used to file, brush, sand and/or polish nails, the filing surfaces will wear out. To this end, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">covers  44</span>  are designed to be replaceable and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">multiple covers  44</span>  can be sold in a kit with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">single handle  42</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> </p>
                    
                        <p>    Handle  42</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">cover  44</span>  can have any of a variety of different forms and cross-sections, not limited to the substantially square cross-section as shown. For example, although a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">four-sided handle  42</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">cover  44</span>  are shown, each can be provided with only three sides, i.e., a triangular cross-section. In this case, only three filing surfaces can be provided. Also, although the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle  42</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">cover  44</span>  are shown with flat sides, the sides can be curved.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIGS. 5 and 6  show another manicure instrument including the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">manicure implement  10</span>  in accordance with the invention. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">Manicure instrument  52</span>  includes upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">lower plates  54</span> ,  56  joined together at their rear ends through a riveting process or a welding process into an elastic single body, with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">sharpened jaw  58</span> ,  60  formed at a front edge of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">respect<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">ive plate  54</span>  or  56</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">Manicure implement  10</span>  in accordance with the invention is rotatably mounted to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">rear joint  62</span>  of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">lower plates  54</span> ,  56  (a rivet or pivot pin) such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">manicure implement  10</span>  is rotatable between a folded, storage position alongside the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">upper plate  54</span>  and an exposed, operational position extending outward from the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">lower plates  54</span> ,  56 . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">shaft hole  64</span>  is formed at each of the front parts of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">lower plates  54</span> ,  56 , while a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">shaft  66</span>  having a base upwardly penetrates the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">shaft holes  64</span>  of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">lower plates  54</span> ,  56  such that the base of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">shaft  66</span>  is stopped on the lower surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">lower plate  56</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">shaft  66</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">hook  68</span>  on its sidewall.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">lever  70</span> , having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">hinge rib  72</span>  at its front end, is movably caught by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">hook  68</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">shaft  66</span>  at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">hinge rib  72</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">lever  70</span>  is normally biased upward by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">elastic upper plate  54</span> , and so it is possible to maintain the movable engagement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">hinge rib  72</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">lever  70</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">hook  68</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">shaft  64</span>  without allowing an undesired removal of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">lever  70</span>  from engagement with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">hook  68</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> </p>
                    
                        <p>    Lever  70</span>  has a first operational position shown in  FIG. 5  in which it can be pressed downward toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">upper plate  54</span>  to cause movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">jaws  58</span> ,  60  together and a second, storage position shown in  FIG. 6  in which it lies against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">manicuring implement  10</span>  and aligns with the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">lower plates  54</span> ,  56 . To maintain the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">lever  70</span>  in the storage position, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">manicure implement  10</span>  is provided with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">upraised projections  74</span>  extending from its edges. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> </p>
                    
                        <p>    Manicure instrument  52</span>  is capable of trimming nails by placing each nail between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">jaws  58</span> ,  60  and pressing the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">lower plates  54</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> 56  together using lever  70</span>  (i.e., by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">pressing lever  70</span>  downward toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">upper plate  54</span> ), as well as cleaning underneath the nails. Nail cleaning is achieved by placing each nail into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">indentation  20</span>  in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">manicuring implement  10</span>  when <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">manicuring implement  10</span>  is rotated outward away from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">upper plate  54</span> , with either the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">straight jaw  16</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">curved jaw  18</span>  being positioned below the nail.
