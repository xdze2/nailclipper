                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A remotely actuated nail clipping apparatus includes a nail clipper body having upper and lower jaws with opposed cutting surfaces. An actuating lever is remotely disposed from the nail clipper body. A linkage, which operably couples the actuating lever to the nail clipper body, passes through the upper jaw of the nail clipper body and interfaces with the lower jaw and enables the user to pull the lower jaw upward toward the upper jaw into a cutting configuration whereby the opposed cutting surfaces of the two jaws engage one another to thereby clip a nail disposed therebetween. Preferably, a hollow vertical shaft rigidly couples the upper jaw of the nail clipper body to the actuating lever and the linkage extends through the interior of the shaft. A platform is preferably secured to the top end of the shaft and provides a support surface for the actuation lever. </p>

                        <p>      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    This invention relates broadly to nail clippers. More particularly, this invention relates to nail clippers having an actuating lever that operates the clipper by means of a linkage in which the actuating lever is remotely disposed from the clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    2. State of the Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    Nail clippers are well known in the art, and are most often used for clipping fingernails and toenails. People who are physically restricted, however, such as those suffering from osteoporosis, a sore back, a pulled muscle, etc., may have difficulty cutting their toenails with a conventional nail clipper because they are unable to bend enough to reach their toes. A number of extension devices are known in the art that allow these restricted users to operate nail clippers without having to physically reach the desired cutting locations.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    One such device, which is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,357,677, employs a conventional nail clipper connected at the first end of an elongate member. A pistol grip handle and trigger are integral to the second end of the elongate member. The trigger actuates the nail clipper via a pull chord that extends through a number of rollers housed by the elongate member. User activation of the trigger pulls the pull chord, which pulls down the end of the lever of the nail clipper, which in turn causes the other end of the lever arm to push down the top jaw of the nail clipper towards the bottom jaw of the nail clipper. This device is complex and expensive to manufacture. Moreover, the joint between the nail clipper and the elongate member is subject to high torque stresses, which can be difficult and costly to address by design and/or can possibly lead to unwanted failure of the apparatus. U.S. Pat. No. 6,601,587 discloses a similar device, which suffers from the same problems and limitations as set forth above.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0007]    The problems of the prior art devices are solved by a remotely actuated nail clipping apparatus of the present invention. The apparatus includes a nail clipper body having upper and lower jaws with opposed cutting surfaces that engage one another to clip a nail. An actuating lever is remotely disposed from the nail clipper body. A linkage operably couples the actuating lever to the nail clipper body. The linkage passes through the upper jaw of the nail clipper and interfaces with the lower jaw, and enables the user to pull the lower jaw upward toward the upper jaw by pressing the actuating lever. The upward movement of the lower jaw toward the upper jaw brings the two jaws into a cutting configuration whereby the opposed cutting surfaces of the two jaws engage one another to thereby clip a nail disposed therebetween.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    In a preferred embodiment, a hollow vertical shaft is rigidly coupled to the upper jaw of the nail clipper body, and the linkage extends through the interior of the shaft. A platform is preferably secured to the top end of the shaft and projects outward perpendicular to the shaft. The platform provides a support surface for the actuation lever whereby the actuation lever pivots about the platform by user manipulation to cause upward movement of the linkage. Such upward movement pulls the lower jaw upward toward the upper jaw, which continues to the cutting configuration where the opposed cutting surfaces of the two jaws engage one another to thereby clip a nail disposed therebetween. In the preferred embodiment, the linkage comprises a cable, wire, rod or other suitable linkage mechanism.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0011]    Turning to  FIG. 1 , a r<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">emotely actuated nail clipper apparatus  1</span>  in accordance with the present invention includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">nail clipper body  2</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">nail clipper body  2</span>  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">upper jaw  9</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower jaw  10</span>  having <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">opposed cutting surfaces  9</span>   a ,  10   a . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">upper jaw  9</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower jaw  10</span>  are configured in a normally open configuration by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">spring hinge  2</span>   a  that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">connects first ends  9</span>   b ,  10   b  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">jaws  9</span> ,  10 , respectively. The opposite ends of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">jaws  9</span> ,  10  have the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">respective cutting surfaces  9</span>   a ,  10   a  that oppose one another. In the normally open configuration, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">cutting surfaces  9</span>   a ,  10   a  are spaced apart to allow a user to insert a nail therebetween.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    The top surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">upper jaw  9</span>  is rigidly attached to the bottom end of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">hollow shaft  3</span>  by adhesive means, welding or other suitable means. The top end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">hollow shaft  3</span>  is rigidly attached to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">platform  4</span>  by adhesive means, welding or other suitable means. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">platform  4</span>  projects from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">shaft  3</span>  preferably in a direction perpendicular to the central axis of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">shaft  3</span>  as shown. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">platform  4</span>  provides a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">support surface  4</span>   a  that supports an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">actuation lever  5</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">actuation lever  5</span>  is preferably realized as a bent arm with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">mating portion  5</span>   a  extending at an angle relative to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle portion  5</span>   b  at a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">pivot section  5</span>   c . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">pivot section  5</span>   c  can be secured to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">platform  4</span>  by a joint (not shown) that allows for pivoting movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">lever  5</span> . During operation, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">mating portion  5</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">lever  5</span>  is oriented parallel to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">support surface  4</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle portion  5</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">lever  5</span>  extends upward at an angle relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">support surface  4</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">mating portion  5</span>   a . The user pushes down on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle portion  5</span>   b  (preferably by supporting the bottom side surface of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">platform  4</span>  with a finger and pressing downward on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle portion  5</span>   b  with a thumb). As shown in  FIG. 2 , the downward movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle portion  5</span>   b  (which is shown by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">arrow  21</span> ) causes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">lever  5</span>  to pivot about the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">pivot section  5</span>   c , which moves the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">mating portion  5</span>   a  upwards.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]    A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">linkage  7</span>  couples the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">mating portion  5</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">actuation lever  5</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower jaw  10</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">nail clipper body  2</span> . In the preferred embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">linkage  7</span>  comprises a cable, wire or thread; however, other suitable linkage mechanisms such as rod can be used. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">linkage  7</span>  is connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">mating portion  5</span>   a  adjacent the top end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">shaft  3</span>  by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">fastener  6</span>  or other suitable connection means. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">linkage  7</span>  extends down through the interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">shaft  3</span>  and through an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">opening  12</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">upper jaw  9</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower jaw  10</span> , where it interfaces thereto. In the preferred embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">linkage  7</span>  extends through an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">opening  13</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower jaw  10</span>  and an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">end lug  8</span>  is fastened to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">linkage  7</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">end lug  8</span>  is sized larger than the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">opening  13</span>  and thus provides a mechanical connection between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower jaw  10</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">linkage  7</span>  to allow for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">linkage  7</span>  to pull the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower jaw  10</span>  upwards toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">upper jaw  9</span> . Other suitable mechanical connection means between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">linkage  7</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower jaw  10</span>  can be used.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0014]      FIG. 2  shows the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail clipper apparatus  1</span>  with the n a closed configuration in accordance with the present invention. Here, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle portion  5</span>   b  has been pressed downward toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">platfor<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">m  4</span>  (arrow  21</span> ), which has caused the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">mating portion  5</span>   a  to move upward relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">pivot section  5</span>   c . Such upward movement moves the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">linkage  7</span>  upward and causes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower jaw  10</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">clipper body  2</span>  to move upward toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">upper jaw  9</span>  with the upper and l<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">ower jaws ( 9</span> ,  10 ) in the cutting configuration whereby the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> respective opposing cutting surfaces ( 9</span>   a ,  10   a ) engage one another. When a nail is placed between c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">utting surfaces ( 9</span>   a ,  10   a ) and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">clipper body  2</span>  is moved into the cutting configuration, the nail disposed therebetween is clipped.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0015]    When the user releases the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle portion  5</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">actuating lever  5</span> , the spring bias force provided by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">spring hinge  2</span>   a  causes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">upper jaw  9</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower jaw  10</span>  to move apart to their normally open configuration, which moves the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">linkage  7</span>  downward and returns the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle portion  5</span>   b  to return back to its resting state as depicted in  FIG. 1 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0016]    The length of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">shaft  3</span>  (and by extension the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">wire/c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">able  7</span> ) can vary between 1</span>â€³ and 60,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">â€³ preferably being 24</span>â€³ to enable a user to clip toenails without bending down.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0017]    There have been described and illustrated herein an embodiment of a remotely actuated nail clipping apparatus. While particular embodiments of the invention have been described, it is not intended that the invention be limited thereto, as it is intended that the invention be as broad in scope as the art will allow and that the specification be read likewise. It will therefore be appreciated by those skilled in the art that yet other modifications could be made to the provided invention without deviating from its spirit and scope as claimed. </p>
