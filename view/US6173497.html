                        <p>      1</span>. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This invention relates to an improved nail clipper and to an improved nail trimming retention device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Discussion of Background Information  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Conventional nail clippers of the prior art have a single lateral lever or handle that pivots about a fulcrum during operation, connected with a pair of cutting-edge equipped spring arms designed for finger-tip pressure operation. The lateral lever or handle may be equipped with a protrusion or “toe” that presses against the spring arm to drive the cutting edges into contact during operation. The lateral lever and the handle are in alignment during the cutting stroke. This may impede the comfort or convenience of the user. Further, the use of a single pivoting lateral lever may require excessive movement of the handle to perform the cutting operation.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">  </p>
                    
                        <p>      French Patent 2</span> 603 467 discloses an improved nail clipper utilizing two lateral levers. However, the cutting jaws cannot be rotated relative to the lateral levers because an external casing would prevent such rotation. Again, the requirement that the lateral levers and the cutting jaws be in alignment during operation may impede the comfort or convenience of the user.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 5,063,666 describes a nail clipper with two lateral handles, and a jaw pincer member formed by a short upper body and a long lower body, which also serves as one of the lateral handles. The jaw pincer member has cutting edges that are parallel, rather than perpendicular, to the longitudinal direction of the handle. Nevertheless, the angle between the cutting edges and the handles cannot be changed during operation, as the open end portion of the jaw pincer member remains fixed perpendicular to the nail clipper handles.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 2,890,706 discloses a combination manicuring device having two sets of lateral blades. The shorter blades are used as cuticle cutters and the curved longer blades are used as nail cutters. The blades, as well as the file implements and tips, are all unitary with the leaves, and the leaves are secured at one end by spot welds. The secured end also serves as a handle, as is generally the case with prior art nail clippers. Here again, however, independent movement of the jaw pincers, relative to the lateral handles or levers, is not accomplished.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 4,117,591 discloses an improved nail clipping implement featuring a nail retaining clamping device to secure a nail trimming in position for the duration of a cutting operation. Thin internal blades made of a resilient material are used for achieving the nail retaining function. This solution is not totally reliable, and it is expensive and complicated, requiring substantial manufacturing precision of the thin blades. Moreover, this nail clipping implement also does not permit the nail clipper handle to be moved independently of the jaw pincers during operation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, an object of this invention is to provide an improved nail clipper which permits both lateral handles of the nail clipper handle to be moved independently of the jaw pincers during operation. Further, an object of this invention is to provide a more practical, less expensive and more reliable method of entrapping nail fragments in conjunction with such a nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The improved nail clipper of this invention include two elongated, biased apart jaw members made of spring steel that form a substantially Y-shaped, resilient central pincer member. The jaw members are spot welded and/or riveted together, and are provided with opposed, turned-up and down, cutting edges or blades, having the requisite curvature and clipping ability.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Alternatively, the central pincer member may be a one-piece, resilient, substantially U-shaped member, and also be provided with opposed, turned-up and down, cutting edges or blades, having the requisite curvature and clipping ability.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      According to another aspect of the invention, the central jaw member also is substantially U-shaped, and includes two substantially rigid, separate jaw members that are hingedly connected to each other. The jaw members are provided with opposed cutting edges, and are biased apart with a coil spring positioned around the transverse assembling pin.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The first and second jaws members of the nail clippers of the present invention are each provided with aligned, substantially circular bores at their open end portions near the cutting edges. A transverse assembling pin, with a machined central recess (i.e., an under cut portion) and hooked ends, passes through, and can rotate in, these bores. A pair of symmetrical levers or handles provided with a substantially U-shaped notch at their front ends, where they have a cross bar that is hingedly coupled to the hooked ends of the transverse assembling pin.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The lateral levers or handles of the present invention do not generally require the cam-like projection or “toe” with which the handles of prior art nail clippers are provided. The removal of this toe facilitates a more comfortable grip of the nail clipper, as it reduces the angle between the lateral levers and the jaw pincer member, when the handles are positioned at a ready position at the beginning of a cutting stroke. The length of the small tip or notch of the lateral handles or levers may be reduced in order to increase the mechanical advantage of the handles. This reduction of the small tip&#39;s length is possible because the cutting edges of the nail clipper of this invention, during a cutting stroke, need to travel a shorter distance than the cutting edges of nail clippers of the prior art, such as half as far, because both jaws of the nail clippers are movable.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      According to another aspect of the invention, a coil spring is inserted on the transverse assembling pin, with which it is substantially coaxial, in order to compensate for the lack of resiliency of the jaw members. The coil spring pushes apart the substantially rigid jaw members.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      According to the present invention, the lateral handles may be of standard shape or may be provided with ergonomically advantageous features, such as a tear-drop shaped. The lateral handles always remain aligned with each other, independently of their angle of rotation with respect the jaw pincer member. As the lateral handles are pressed toward each other, the cutting edges of the jaw pincer member are urged toward each other, until their cutting edges make contact and a nail inserted therebetween is clipped. The lateral levers can be rotated about the axis of the transverse assembling pin, and they can be positioned and deployed at the ready position where they form an acute angle with respect to the jaw pincer member, or at a closed position, ready for storage. At this latter position, the nail clipper occupies less space. It is understood that the jaw pincer member can be rotated about the axis of the transverse clip and operated at any angle with respect to the lateral levers, which in all instances remain aligned with each other, including during the cutting stroke.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      According to one embodiment of the present invention, the nail clipper is provided with high mechanical advantage and is especially designed for clipping toe nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This invention also provides alternative devices for catching and holding nail clippings. Further, these devices for entrapping clipped nail fragments preferably use an elastic material (e.g., a plastic material) that is positioned at the end portion of the jaw members, such that when the jaw members come into contact at the end of a cutting stroke, the just-clipped nail fragment is immobilized and remains entrapped as long as the lateral levers are pressed toward each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention provides a nail clipper that includes two elongated jaw members having opposed, spaced apart cutting blades at a first end, where the two jaw members are connected at a second end to form a substantially Y-shaped, resilient central pincer member, where the two jaw members having aligned openings; a transverse assembling pin with hooked first and second ends; and two symmetrical elongated handles, where each of the elongated handles has a short portion and a long portion, where the short portion has a U-shaped bifurcated end and a cross bar connecting the bifurcated end, and where each hooked end of the transverse assembling pin is connected with a hinge to a respective handle cross bar to retain the elongated handles in alignment. Further, the long portions of the two symmetrical handles may substantially straight, or they may be curved. A rivet may connect the two jaw members at the second ends. Moreover, the nail clipper may include a tong of an elastic material being provided on an inner portion of the first end of each jaw member, and the tong is capable of blocking and retaining a nail fragment at the end of a cutting stroke. The elastic material of the tong may be a plastic foam, or alternatively it may be rubber.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      According to another aspect of the invention, a nail clipper is provided that includes a substantially ellipsoidal piece of an elastic material that has two flat pole ends and a cylindrical axial bore, where the ellipsoidal piece is adapted to receive the transverse assembling pin, where the flat pole ends being in contact with the jaw members, and where the ellipsoidal piece is capable of blocking and retaining a nail fragment at the end of a cutting stroke. The elastic material of the ellipsoidal piece may be a plastic foam.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      According to yet another aspect of the invention, a nail clipper is provided that includes two elongated jaw members having opposed cutting blades at a first end, where the two jaw members are connected with a hinge at a second end to form a substantially U-shaped, resilient central pincer member, and where the two jaw members having substantially round, aligned openings; a transverse assembling pin with hooked first and second ends; a coil spring adapted to receive the transverse assembling pin and to bias apart the first ends of the two elongated jaw members; two symmetrical elongated handles, each of the elongated handles including a short portion and a long portion, where the short portion has a U-shaped bifurcated end and a cross bar connecting the bifurcated end, and where each hooked end of the transverse assembling pin being hingedly connected to a handle cross bar to retain the elongated handles in alignment. The effective length of the jaw members may be at<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> least approximately 7</span>.5 cm, and the distance between<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> the cutting blades may be approximately 2</span>.4 mm when the nail clipper is in an open position. Moreover, the long portions of the two symmetrical handles may be substantially straight, or alternatively, the long portions of the two symmetrical handles may be curved.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      According to still another aspect of the invention, a nail clipper is provided that includes two elongated jaw members having opposed, spaced apart cutting blades at a first end, where the two jaw members are connected at a second end to form a substantially U-shaped, resilient central pincer member, and where the two jaw members have substantially round, aligned openings; a transverse assembling pin with hooked first and second ends; two symmetrical elongated handles, each of the elongated handles including a short portion and a long portion, where the short portion has a U-shaped bifurcated end and a cross bar connecting the bifurcated end, and where each hooked end of the transverse assembling pin is hingedly connected to a handle cross bar to retain the elongated handles in alignment. The long portions of the two symmetrical handles may be substantially straight, or alternatively they may be curved.

                        <p>      FIGS. 22 and 23 illustrate another feature of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">toe nail clipper  46</span> . FIG. 22 shows a segment of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">lateral handle  54</span>  having <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">short bifurcated portion  55</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">long portion  56</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">intersection point  57</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">cross line  58</span>  indicate the standard position of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">cross bar  43</span>  on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">small bifurcated portion  55</span> . FIG. 23, in turn, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">shows displaced intersection point  60</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">cross bar  43</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">cross line  61</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">bifurcated portion  55</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">lateral handle  54</span> . Due to the position of the cross bar being displaced, the distance between the fulcrum of lever system and the point designating the application of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">force via handle  54</span>  is shortened, resulting is considerably increased mechanical advantage.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This feature is again illustrated in FIGS. 24 and 25. In FIG. 25, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">cross bar  43</span>  has been displaced toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">long portion  64</span>  of h<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">andle (lever)  42</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">Cross bar  43</span>  is the fulcrum of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle  42</span> , while line of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem63">curvature  63</span>  substantially coincides with the point of application of force on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle  42</span> . Thus, the fulcrum and the point of application of force of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">handle  42</span>  are closer in FIG. 25 than in FIG.  24 . Consequently, mechanical advantage is substantially increased. It should be noted that in FIG. 25, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">cavity  66</span>  extends into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">long portion  64</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">lever  42</span> , and that the distance “b” between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">cross bar  43</span>  and line of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem63">curvature  63</span>  is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> approximately 3</span> mm.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIG. 26A shows a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">transverse assembling pin  9</span>  of normal length, and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem67">shorter transverse assembling pin  67</span>  which is used in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">toe nail clipper  46</span> . In FIG. 26B, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem67">shorter transverse assembling pin  67</span>  proportionally decreases the length of separation between the cutting edges of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">pincer jaw member  47</span>  while at the open position, ready for use. In turn, this decreases the length of the portion of the cutting stroke where the cutting edges are not in contact with the nail to be clipped. Again, the desired result is to increase the cutting force of the cutting edges or blades, by means of increased mechanical advantage of the lever system of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">toe nail clipper  46</span> . A reduction in assembling pin length of up to 20%, with a corresponding reduction in the distance between the cutting edges or blades, does not interfere with the comfortable positioning of the nail to be clipped or trimmed, between the blades.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIG. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">27 shows jaw members  48</span> ,  49 , at their ready condition at the beginning of a cutting stroke. The preferred distance “c” between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">cutting edges  5</span> ,  6  is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> approximately 2</span>.4 mm.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIG. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">28 shows nail clipper  68</span>  at its open position, ready for use. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem69">Jaw pincer member  69</span>  includes <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first jaw member  70</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71">second jaw member  71</span>  having <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">inner curved spaces  72</span> ,  73  adjacent to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">cutting edges or blades  5</span> ,  6 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">Inner curved spaces  72</span> ,  73  are provided with molded and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">glued cushions or tongs  74</span> ,  75 , made of an elastic material (e.g., a plastic material), such as “EVA” or rubber, or any other resilient and preferably somewhat compressible material. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">Nail tip  76</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem77">finger  77</span>  is positioned between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">cutting edges or blades  5</span> ,  6 , and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">abutted against blade  5</span> , to perform a nail clipping operation.  </p>
