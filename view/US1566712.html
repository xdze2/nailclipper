                        <p>  Application filed August 1, 1.923.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Be it known that ANDERs BRYNOLF WAL- aspecification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   .This invention relates to a manicure and pedicure implement comprising a handle and one or more preferably detachable cutting tools. The characteristic feature of the invention consists in the edges of the cutting tools being so shaped, that after the cutting operation the contour of the edge of the nail&#39;in cross section is convex or rounded, so that there are no sharp recesses or projections any subsequent trimming of the nail being thus rendered superfluous or at least considerably facilitated.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A form of the invention is shown as an example in the accompanying drawing. Fig. I is a side view of the implement. Figs. 2 and 3 show a cutting tool viewed from two different sides.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Fig. 4 is a section on the line 4-4 of Fig. 2. Fig. 5 is a section on an enlarged scale of a finger, the nail of which has been cut by means of an implement arranged in accordance with this in vention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Fig. 6 illustrates the manner in which the cutting operation is effected. Fig. 7 shows a form with two tools.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1 is the handle of the implement, 2 a holder of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> cutting tool or tools 3</span>, and 4 a screw or nut by means of which the tools are fixed.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Besides, the implement may be provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> cleansing or trimming tool 5</span> of known construction. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> cutting tools 3</span> areoreferabl &#39;roove sha ed as shown in Figs. 2 and 3.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  On the rear side of the cutting tool, opposite to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> grooved side 6</span> o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">ne or more plane or curve shaped surfaces 7</span> Fig. 3, have been ground, each having an oblique direction inward toward the groove, so that the edge thus effected, is substantially curve shaped viewed in the longitudinal direction of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> groove 6</span>. The shape of the groove may, evidently, be varied and the cutting edge of the tool may constitute a broken line, the main thing is that the shape shown in Fig. 5 is imparted to the edge of the nail by the cutting operation. The cross section of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> cutting tool 3</span>, shown in Fig. 4:, is substantially sickle shaped, but many other shapes may, evidently, be used.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The cutting tool in question may advantageously be used also as a scraping tool, bv preferably a plurality of thin tools being Serial No. 655,125.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  so combined, that they constitute a file.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The end of the cutting tool may, if nee-- essary, be bent into theshape of a hook or the like. The handle may, evidently, be so shaped that it constitutes itself the cutting tool, or the substantially curve shaped cut ting edge may be provided on a knife-blade.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The grinding of the tool may easily be effected.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  .I claim shape, substantially as described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In testimony whereof I have aflixed my sign ature.   </p>
