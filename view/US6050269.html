                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates, in general, to manicure implements and, more particularly, to nail scissors integrally formed with a nail file, a cuticle trimmer and eyebrow tweezers, a manicure implement being easily carried and stored, the use of the implement being convenient, the period of time for manicuring nails being reduced, and loss of component parts being prevented.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Description of the Prior Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Conventionally, women are interested in and spend significant time manicuring their nails and cuticles prettily and cleanly. A manicure set for manicuring the nails and c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">uticles typically comprises nail scissors 1</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> nail file 2</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> cuticle trimmer 3</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> eyebrow tweezers 4</span>. That is, such a set includes multiple independent manicure implements.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In the use of the set, multiple independent manicure implements are used alternately pursuant to their uses so as to manicure the nails and cuticles. Therefore, such independent manicure implements are very troublesome and time-wasteful because a user has to use the independent implements alternately pursuant to their uses.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Additionally, in case that, as shown in FIG. 1, the independent manicure implements are carried in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> manicure set case 5</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> case 5</span> may not be easily carried because the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> case 5</span> is voluminous. Further, in case that the component implements are carried in a bag, such as a handbag, they may be difficult to carry as they add weight to the bag.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      On the other hand, in the case wherein only some of the component implements are carried, complete manicuring is not carried out because sufficient manicure implements may not be provided.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Further more, manicure implements are easily lost because they are separate and small. When such loss occurs, sufficient manicure may not be carried out.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>

                        <p>      Hereinafter, operation of the embodiment is described.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      When the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> nail scissors 110</span> of this embodiment are used as a scissors, two fingers, such as, the thumb and the index finger, or the thumb and the middle finger, are inserted into the holes of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> ring-shaped handles 102</span>, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101"> blades 101</span> are manipulated opened ans closed, alternately. Simultaneously, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101"> blades 101</span> are so pivoted together on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103"> shaft 103</span> as a center that their<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem109"> sharp edges 109</span> work one against the other, thereby cutting unnecessary cuticles about the nails by the action.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      When stiff cuticles are desired to be removed, the cuticles are easily removed using the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> eyebrow tweezers 114</span> formed at the ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> ring-shaped handles 102</span>, as shown in FIG. 7. Additionally, hair, such as downy hair around eyebrows and legs, is easily removed in the same way. In case that the ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> tweezers 114</span> are individually provided with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116"> inclined surface 116</span>, fine hair may be easily removed by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> tweezers 114</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Since one of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101"> blades 101</span> is provided with at least an elliptical and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111"> longitudinal nail file portion 111</span>, the ends of nails are smoothed by rubbing the rough ends of nails upon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111"> file portion 111</span> after the nails are clipped. As shown in FIG. 8, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111"> file portion 111</span> may be divided into three sub-portions, that is, an upper sub-portion 111a, a middle sub-portion 111b and a lower sub-portion 111c. A strong fingernail, such as the thumbnail, may be smoothed by the roughest upper sub-portion 111a, a hard fingernail, such as the nail of the index finger or the nail of the middle finger, may be smoothed by a rougher middle sub-portion 111b, and a relatively soft fingernail, such as the nail of the little finger, may be smoothed by the rough lower sub-portion 111c.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As a consequence, the period of time required for smoothing the nails may be reduced and the nails are more smoothly filed because a variety of file sub-portions may be selected according to the nail conditions, such as, the thickness of a nail and the trimmed state of a nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      When trimming along the nail is required, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> cuticle trimmer 112</span> may be used. The cuticle trimmer 112a, having a flat edge, is used to trim a wide and long portion, while the cuticle trimmer 112a, having a peaked edge, is used to trim a valley portion around the nail. Therefore, undesired cuticles are easily removed by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> trimmer 112</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As a result, the nail scissors of this invention allows scissors, a nail file, a cuticle trimmer and eyebrow tweezers to be treated not separately, but as a whole. Therefore, a variety of manicure implements are immediately available while they are carried together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As described above, since this invention provides nail scissors integrally formed with a nail file, a cuticle trimmer and eyebrow tweezers, a manicure implement is easily carried and stored, the use of the implement is convenient, the period of time for manicuring nails and cuticles is reduced, and loss of component parts is prevented.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims. </p>
