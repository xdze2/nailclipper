                        <p>  Application filed March 19, 1928. Serial No. 262,709.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   T his invention relates to finger nail clips for toilet purposes, and has for its object the production of such an implement comprising the fewest practicable parts, each individually detachable and which has no pivot pin, and can be readily taken apart and put together again without the use of tools.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The invention includes the three separable parts illustrated in the accompanying drawings, of which Fig. 1 represents a side view of one of the jaws, and Fig. 2 a top view thereof looking at the flat side or face of the jaw. Fig. 3 is a side view of the complementary jaw and Fig. 4 is a bottom or flat face view of the jaw. Fig. 5 is a side View of the two jaws in engagement without the spring. Fig. 6 is a top view of the V-shaped spring, and Fig. 7 is a bottom view thereof. Fig. 8 is a side view of all the parts assembled. Fig. 9 is a sectional view of the cutter spring taken upon the broken line 99 of Fig. 7.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   &#39;The scale o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem99">f drawing is do</span>uble the actual size of this invention to render the construction clearer, and throughout the drawings and description the same number is used to refer to the same part.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Considering the drawings, the jaw 1 has the offset projections 2 and 8 provi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">ded ne</span>ar their<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> extrem<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">ities with the small</span></span> transverse grooves 4t and 5. Between the projections is a space marked 6.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">he second jaw 7</span> having a single offset projection<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> at the jaw e</span>nd provided with the transverse groove 9.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   By introducing the si<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">ngle projection 8 of</span> jaw 7 into the space 6 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">of the end of jaw 1,</span> th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">e two </span>jaws may <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">be assoc</span>iated as illus<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">trated</span> in Fig. 5. The jaws may be provided with small holes 10 and 11 at their free ends, inte<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nded to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> engage a clip </span></span>or key-ring as shown in Fig. 5, and which will hold the jaws together.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In Figs. (3 and 7 and 9 the Vshaped cutter spring is referred to as a whole by the number 12. The spring has a curving cutting ed<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ge 13, and</span> a recess 14 in it<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">s rear. On one side or f</span>ace of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">the spring</span> is formed a single depression 15, and on the other face th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">e two spaced depressi</span>ons 16 and 17. In Fig. 9 it<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> will b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">e noted that the cutting e</span></span>dges 13 slant towards each other, and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> that by reason o</span>f the formation of the depression 16 and the other depressions a ridg<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">e or shoulder </span>19 is formed between the dep<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">ression and the cutti</span>ng edge. In assembling the parts the project-ions 2 and 3 of jaw 1 engage the space<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">d depre<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">ssions 16 and </span></span>17,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> and t</span>he ridges b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">etween <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">those projections and </span></span>the cutting edge of the spring enter grooves at and 5. Similarly the projection 8 seats itself in depression 15, an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">d the adjacen</span>t ridge engages <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">groove 9/ In o</span>peration,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> if the jaws are opened as shown</span> in Fig. 8 the spring 12 may be positioned or removed by brin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ging its c</span>utting edges together with the fingers, no tool being called for.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The clasp or key-ring 18 may be of any selected pa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">ttern, and the clip a</span>s a whole, usually ornamental in design externally, may be carried attached to a watch chain or the like.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It will now be understood that only three parts are required. to complete this invention, that it has no pivot pin or rivet, and that the parts are freely detachable and as easily assembled, resulting in a very effective and convenient clip for cutting the finger nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having now described this invention and explained the manner of its operation, I claim:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1. A nail clip, comprising separable jaws provided at the ends with oppositely oflset projections, the said projections being constructed to engage each other leaving a space between the jaw ends, each of the said projections having a transverse groove near its extremity, and a cutter spring located in the said space and having ridges arranged in engagement with the said grooves of the projections whereby the jaws are maintained in engagement against displacement in the direction of the length of said jaws and the said spring is held in operative relation to the jaws and against displacement therefrom.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2. A nail clip comprising jaws separable bodily, one of said jaws having at its end a portion formed into a pair of spaced offset projections, a second jaw having a single off-set projection passing between the said spaced projections of the first aw, the projections of both jaws having transverse grooves at their extremities, and a cutter spring having a rear recess receiving and engaging the outer sides of the said pair of projections of the first jaw whereby the spring is held against displacement sidewise, the said cutter spring being located between the said projections of the jaws as shown and constructed and arranged to engage the said grooved ends of the said projections, the expansion of the said spring acting to keep the jaws together in operative relation and prevent relative displacement of said jaws in the direction of the length of the jaws.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In testimony whereof I aflix my signature.   </p>
