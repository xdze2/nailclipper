                        <p>  Application September 3, 1954, Serial No. 454,074   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Claims. (Cl. 3028) This invention is concerned with nippers of the type used for trimming the nails of digits, that is, either fingers or toes. More specifically, it relates to the profile shape of the cooperating jaws of the nipper.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Conventional fingernail nippers have concave jaws the profile curvature of which is continuous. Toenail nippers have jaws with either a concave, straight or possibly slightly convex profile. Nippers intended for trimming fingernails usually are not well suited to the trimming of toenails and vice versa.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is the principal object of this invention to provide a nail nipper having jaws with a reverse curve profile. With such a curvature the jaws can be used effectively to trim either fingernails or toenails, and particularly can be shaped for better access to the sides of nails, even for the purpose of trimming ingrown nails more effectively, or for nipping hangnails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   in particular, the purpose of the present invention is to provide a nail nipper the jaws of which have a profile with a major concave portion, but having at least one and possibly two convex portions. Moreover, it is preferred that such convex portion or portions be more sharply curved than the concave portion of the jaw profile. Such convex portion terminates abruptly in a pointed corner or peak at one end.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The aforesaid objects of the present invention can be accomplished by nipper jaw profiles of varying types, such as of ogee curvature or of peaked ogee curvature where a single convex portion of the profile is sutficient, or of continuous concavo-biconvex or double-peaked concavobiconvex profile if it is desired to have two convex portions in the profile. The jaws of such profile may be supported, connected and operated for opening and closing movement by structure and mechanism of conventional type which is not part of the present invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Nippers having several representative types of jaw profile in accordance with the present invention are illustrated in the drawing and described hereafter.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 1 is a top perspective view of a nail nipper having jaws with a continuously curved concavo-biconvex profile, and Figure 2 is a central longitudinal section through the nipper, portions being broken away and the stationary jaw being shown in profile.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 3 is a top perspective view of a nail nipper hav ing jaws with an ogee curved profile, and Figure 4 is a central longitudinal section through the nipper, portions being broken away and the stationary jaw being shown in profile.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 5 is a top perspective view of a nail nipper having jaws with a peaked ogee curved profile, and Figure 6 is a central longitudinal section through the nipper, portions being broken away and the stationary jaw being shown in profile.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 7 is a top perspective view of a nail nipper having jaws with a double-peaked concavo-biconvex curved profile, and Figure 8 is a central longitudinal section through the nipper, portions being broken away and the stationary jaw being shown in profile.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The various types of nipper shown in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> drawin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem774">gs all <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem138">2,774,138</span></span></span> Patented Dec. 18,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> 1956 i<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ce incorporate jaws 1 and 2</span></span> formed on the ends of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> arms 3<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> and 4</span></span>, respectively, which are interconnected, such as by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> hollow rivet 5</span> at the end remote from such jaws. On one of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> jaws 2</span> is mounted a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> guide pin 6</span> over which fits snugly an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> aperture 7</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> other jaw 1</span>. Such pin and aperture guides this jaw for accurate movement toward and away from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> jaw 2</span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> lever 8</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> notch 9</span> in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> one end forming bifurcations 19</span> carrying lugs which are pivotally engaged with the end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> pin 6</span> remote from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> jaw 2</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> arms 3<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> and 4</span></span> are of spring material and, because of their interconnection by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> rivet 5</span>, urge their<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> jaws 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> and 2</span></span> apart. Separating movement of the jaws is limited by engagement of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> jaw 1</span> with the bifurcations of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> lever 8</span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> bent portion 11</span> of this lever may function as a fulcrum bearing on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> arm 3</span> when pressure is exerted on the swinging end of the lever. Force thus exerted by the lever on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> arm 3</span> will move the swinging end of such arm and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> jaw 1</span> toward the adjacent end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> arm 4</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> jaw 2</span> respectively. Such supporting and jaw operating mechanism is conventional and is illustrated merely to show suitable structure for supporting and mechanism for operating jaws having profiles embodying the principles of the present invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the nipper shown in Figures 1 and 2 the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">g edges 12 and 13</span></span> are shown as being of continuous concavo-biconvex curvature. The central concave portion of the cutting edges merges with convex portions at opposite ends of such cutting edges. The concavely reentrant curved central portion of these cutting edges extends over a major portion of their length as is evident from Figure 2, and the concavely curved portion merges smoothly and continuously with each of the convex portions. Preferably, as shown, the convex portions are more sharply curved than the concave portion, and as shown, the profile of each cutting edge may be symmetrical about its center. As shown, the outerends of the convex portions of the cutting edges terminate abruptly in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> sharp corners 12</span>&#39; and 13&#39; so that the convex portions, which are sharpened to such sharp corners, are useful as nippers despite the concave shape extending over the major portions of such cutting edges. Such sharp corners enable the convex cutting edge portions to be used like the portions of manicure scissor blades adjacent to their points.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In Figures 3 and 4 the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">g edges 14 and 15</span></span> are of ogee profile, in which the portion of concave curvature again constitutes a major portion of the length of the cutting edges and merges smoothly into the curvature of the convex portion of the cutting edges. In this instance again it is preferred that the convex curvature be somewhat sharper than the concave curvature. By providing only a single portion of convex curvature on the cutting edge, the concave portion of the cutting edge can be made substantially longer than the concave portion of the cutting edge in the type of nipper shown in Figures 1 and 2, the curvatures of the concave cutting edge portion and of the convex cutting edge portion of the nipper shown in Figures 3 and 4 can be made less sharp, respectively,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  than the curvatures of the concave cutting edge portionand of the convex cutting edge portions of the nipper shown in Figures 1 and 2. In this construction also, however, the convex portions of the cutting edges terminate abruptly in sharp corners l4 and 15&#39; so that the convex portions, sharpened to such sharp corners, are useful as a nipper.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The profile of the cutting edges on the nipper shown in Figures 5 and 6 is somewhat similar to that of the cutting edges of the nipper shown in Figures 3 and 4. Thus each of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">g edges 16 and 17</span></span>, like the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">g edges 14 and 15</span></span>, includes a concave portion and a single convex portion. In this instance, however, the curvature of the concave and convex portions is discontinuous, such portions meeting at<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> peaks 16</span>&#39; and 17&#39; forming sharp edges are sharpened to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> &#39;such&#39;peaks 16</span>&#39; and 17&#39; at which they&#39;terminate abruptly at their junction with the concave portions, so as to formefiective nipper portions.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is still preferred in the form of; Figures and 6 that the length of the&#39;c&#39;onca&#39;ve portion of the cutting edges be a major portion of the total length of the cutting edges and the length or the convex portion a minor portion of the total length. Also, as mentioned in connection with the previous types of cut-ting edge pro-file, it is preferred that ends of fingernails or toenails to a pleasing curvature. Provision of the convex portions at opposite ends of the concave portion in the form of Figure 2 eliminates the usual sharp points which can inadvertently be dug into the tissue beneath a nail to cause pain. More important,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  however, either-of the&#39;convex portions can be used cona veniently to trim the sides of a nail easily to the desired shape, even-though the nail may be ingrown, and to nip hangnails, comparable to the use of the pointed ends of manicure scissors blades.- 7   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The shape of cutting edge shownpon the&#39;clipper of 7 Figures 3 and 4 provides a rounded convex portion havthe curvature of the&#39;convex cutting edge portion&#39;be sharp-.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  &#39; er than the curvature of the concave cutting edge portion.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Because &#39;thecurvatures of the &#39;convexand concave cutting edge portions are discontinuous, the sharpness of the curvature of either portion can be selected entirely without reference to the curvature of the other portion, the   </p>
                    
                        <p>  , only effect being to alter somewhat the angle of the peak formed by the junction of the two curves of each cutting edge. V <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">  </p>

In the cutting edgesof Figures 7 and 8,&#34;however, the curvature of the&#39;two convex portions .and&#39; the concave portionbetween them is discontinuous. Thus the concave portions meet the convex portions in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> peaks <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">18 and 19</span></span> which are sharp corners, forming a double-peaked coning a substantial projection terminating abruptly in sharp corners which is even more easily inserted into portions of the nail side to which access is difficult. The peak and side convex portion shown on the clipper of Figures 5 and 6 may be preferred by some users for a similar manipulation.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> V 7</span>   </p>
