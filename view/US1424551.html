                        <p>   Be it known that l, AUNA F. BLANCHARD, a citizen of the United States,-residing at Cranston, in the county of Providence and State of Rhode island, have invented certain new and useful improvements in Combination Pocketknives and Nail Clips, of which the following is a specication.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This application is a continuation in part of my cofpending application filed September 10, 1919,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem322"> Serial<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem981"> Number 322,981</span></span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The invention has for an object to provide a combination pocket knife and nail clip, in which there are utilized well known elements of pocketl knives in such a manner that the cheek plates or handle por tions may be utilized as clip devices for clipping finger nails and the like. 1t is a further important aim of the invention to eifect improvements in` such va device whereby the clipping action will be made quite easy by the provision of means which will increase the leverage of the arm by which the clip portion is operated, and whereby in the closing of the device, when not in use. excessive pressure upon the clipping blades is obviated as wellv as ease in. closing the device attained. f   </p>
                    
                        <p>   .Additional objects, advantages and features of invention will. appear from the construction, arrangement and combination of parts hereinafter described and shown in theV drawings presenting one embodiment&#39; of thek invention, wherein,   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 1 is a perspective view of an implement constructed in accordance with my invention, in open position7 Fig..2 is a side elevation thereof,- closed, Fig. 3 is an enlarged longitudinal sectional view of the operative parts at the j clipl end,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  &#39; fulcnum member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  springs, there being no lining plate at the outer sides cf the device beneath the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> plates<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> 10 and 11</span></span>, in the present instance.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> Blades<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> 15 and 16</span></span> are pivoted in a usual manner at&#34; i one end of the device between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> plates 10</span> and&#39; 11; the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> blade 16</span> is a nail file and cleaner. i f   </p>
                    
                        <p>   lt should be noted that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> spring<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">s 12 and 13</span></span> are not secured between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> plates<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> 10 and 11</span></span> at the end opposite the pivot in the blade in the usual manner familiar in the art, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> plates 1</span>() and 11, which correspond to the ordinary lining plates, are projected slightly beyond the springs and middle lining plate at that end of the device opposite the pivot of the blades. The springs and plates are secured together by an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> intermediate rivet 17</span> having the usual location with respect to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pivot 18</span> of the blades, but   </p>
                    
                        <p>  &#39;the extremities of the springs opposite the pivot are not secured to the outer plates at all, although they may be secured&#39; together upon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> lining plate 14</span> as indicated at 19. 1n the present case, the second point of securement of the spring to an outer member is at 20, a point intermediately of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> rivet 17</span> and the ends of the springs opposite the blade pivot. This&#39;securement may beof an ordinary character, which would. leave the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> plates<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> 10 and 11</span></span> free for relative flexure from this point outwardly on their adjacent extremities. But, in &#39;the present instance, I have shown the springsas riveted to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> plate <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">10</span> only asat 20</span>, but the rivet is` formed: with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> taper tenon 21</span> loosely in a recess or aperture in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> plate 11</span>. By this construction the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> plate 11</span> is permittedV relative movement from its point of. secui&#39;ement at 17, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> vplate 11</span>&#39; is supported against the ordinary stresses to which it would&#39; be subjected as a part of a knife handle by the pivot &#39;18 and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> tenen 21</span>, in addition to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> rivet 17</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The extensions of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> plates 10 and 11</span></span> are provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> nail clip jaws or blades 22</span>, a short distance outwardly of the springs, and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> reinforcing flanges 23</span> are formed on each side of these extensions proinserted jected inwardly and extending throughout thelength of the extensions. The extensions of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> plates 1</span>()l and 11 to form the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> clips <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">may be termed clip jaws 10 and 11</span></span>&#39;, respectively. lt should be noted that the plates are given a set causing these jaws to tend to incline outwardly from each other toward their outer ends, and that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> plate 11</span> may diverge from the knife springs be-v ginning at the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> rivet 17</span> and extending over a major &#39;part of the length of the knife handle.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   ln the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaw 11</span> there is iset a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> stud 24</span>, having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> tenon 25</span> projected through an aperture 260i rectangular form. extending longitudinally of the jaw countersunk on the outer side.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> rrlhe tenon 25</span> is peened in this aperture, so as to form a dove-tail connection.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  &#39; rlhe stud is stamped from sheet metal, and   </p>
                    
                        <p>  the tenon25 may be formed by notching the` base of the stud at opposite corners, the   </p>
                    
                        <p>  j intermediate portion of this tenon being the full thickness of the blank and adapted to iit snugly between the sides of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> aperture 26</span> vwhen inserted. The stud is provided at its outer end with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> transverse pin 27</span>, the axis of which is inthe present instance between the jaws when in open position as y shown in Fig. 7. Pivoted Aupon this pin there is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> lever 28</span> formed from a blank of sheet metal bent vinto U-shape in&#39; cross section,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> ears 29</span> at each side, mounted upon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> pin 27</span>, these ears being projected laterally from the lever in parallel relation and being engaged through an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> aperture 30</span> c formed in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> plate 10</span> having proper dimensions to receive the parts loosely, for the yfunction to bedescribed. The inner longitudinal edges ofthe lever are so extended as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> Ato lie flat upon .the plate 10</span> and within a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> recessed portion 31</span> n thereof when the two plates have been moved inwardly toward each other until the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> blades 22</span> nearly or quite engage, and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> sliding latch 32</span> is provided I to engage over the end of the lever when in this positionjto hold the parts in closed relation. By, having the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> tenon 21</span> slightly 5e y Y, used for cutting with the blade, liability of tapered, when the parts are forced` inwardly into this position, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> plate 11</span> will fit tightly upon the tenon so that when the device `is loose movementfof the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> plate 11</span> will be obviated. It is believed, however, that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pivot 18</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> rivet 17</span> are sufficient inthemselves for this purpose.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The? devicemightbe utilized in this form rasv a nail clip, but in order tov provide for Y proper clipping coaction between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> blades 22</span>, and also togive a shiftable fulcrum for the device whereby the vfulcrum will ybe as near as possiblel to the pivot of the lever, or   </p>
                    
                        <p>   lotherwise located for the most efficient appli- `cation ofV Vforce through the lever, I have provided in the lever a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> longitudinallyshiftable fulcrum 31</span>. This lfulcrum `consists of a transverse bar from which there lis ex- `tended at right angles a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> stem 32</span> laid within j the lever close to the bightportion,as viewed in cross section, and having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> lateral &#39;ishaped extension 33</span> at one side, the head portion of vwhich is inserted through a slot&#39; 34 formed medially in the lever, the head portion extending transverselyof thev slot so as to hold the fulcrum device in place.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> rihe retaining &#39;portion 33</span> is put in position by first twisting the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82"> stem 82</span> ,adjacent the bar 3i for a quarter turn, and after inserting the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> member 33</span> through the slot 34C, the   </p>
                    
                        <p>  head portion is given a quarter turn twist also, to set it transversely of the slot. For the functioning of the fulcrum, the lever is provided Awith two notches next to the jaw l0 oneach edge close to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> ears 29</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> outer notch 35</span> is a shallow one, while the notch further from the ears is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> deep one 36</span> and is adapted to receive the ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> fulcrum bar 31</span> loosely when the parts are in closed position as shown in Fig; 3, or the notch may be so shaped that the fulcrum will be borne against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> jaw 10</span> so as to hold the parts .in the position shown in Fig.   </p>

                        <p>  `fulcrum bar&#39; will at this time be in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> notches 36</span>, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> shifting head 33</span> on the stem of the lever will beat the inner end of the slot 3e, with respect to the knife handle. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> head 33</span> is adjusted with suiiicient&#39;loose movement to permit the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> fulcrum member 31</span> to fall below the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> notches 36</span> when&#39;t-he lever is raised, or the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> stem 32</span> may be made resilient so that when p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">ressure&#39;is exerted upon &#39;the head 33</span> to cause it to slide&#39; outwardly upon the leverthe fulcrum member will be moved from the notches&#39;36 into the notches In order ,for the fulcrum to engage un der the notches&#39;l it isV necessary to raise the lever to a considerable height.- &#39;Upon downward pressure of the lever then, the -jawsare readily compressed into contact, and it is easy to apply suiiicient pressure to clip a nail. 4 4   </p>
