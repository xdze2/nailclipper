                        <p>  Frank F. Weber, Yorkville, 111&#39;.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Application September 30, 1948, Serial No. 51,988   </p>
                    
                        <p>  1&#39; 4 Claims. (Cl.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> 30-29) V v 1</span> i This invention relates to a novel instrument primarily designed for use in clipping or cutting ingrown toe nails, although adaptable for use in performing other cutting operations or punching operations.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The primary object of the present invention is to provide an instrument of the above kind whose use does not require reaching down to a point in proximity to the work or thing being cut or punched.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object is to provide a simple and durable instrument of the above kind which is easy and safe to use, and which is very efficient in operation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The exact nature of the present invention will become apparent from the following description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 1 is a side elevational view of a cutting instrument constructed in accordance with the present invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Figure 2 is a front elevational view thereof.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 3 is a vertical section taken on line 3-3 of Figure 2.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 4 is an exploded perspective view showing the parts of the blade assembly forming part of the instrument shown in Figure 1.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 5 is a perspective view of the blade assembly.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 6 is a fragmentary sectional view showing how the blades are disposed in clipping an ingrown toe nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure &#39;7 shows a modified form of front cutting blade.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 8 shows a form of front punch plate which may be used in place of the front cuttin blade.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring in detail to the drawings, the present instrument includes<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">s 5 and 6</span></span> which are crossed and pivoted to each other intermediate their ends as at I. The forward end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> handle 5</span> is below the forward end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> handle 6</span> and has the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> angular upper end 8</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> a vertical elongated rear blade or plate 9</span> rigidly attached thereto by rivets I0 or the like. The lower end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> blade 9</span> is formed to provide a rearwardly offset forwardly facing hook-shaped foot portion H whose upturned free transverse edge l2 provides a cutting edge in the same vertical plane as the front face of the flat major upper portion of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> blade 9</span>. Slidably disposed and held against the front face of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> blade 9</span> is a flat vertically movable front blade l3 having a lower cutting edge l4 and detachably connected at its upper end to the forward end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> handle 6</span>. As   </p>
                    
                        <p>  shown, stud screws l5 freely pass through an elongated slot It provided in blade l3 and are screwed into openings I! of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> blade 9</span> to hold said blade l3 in place and guide and upwardly limit it in its vertical movement. A link plate l8 and bolt l8a preferably connects theblade l3 to the forward end of handle &#39;6, and a spring I9 presses the rear ends of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">s 5 and 6</span></span> apart to normally raise the blade [3. A stop screw is adjustably threaded through the forward end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> handle 6</span> and coacts with the forward end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> handle 5</span> to normally limit downward movement of blade l3, so that the lower cutting edge of the latter will coact with the edge I2 of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> blade 9</span> to provide a shearing action but cannot lower to or below the bottom of foot portion H to injure the toe or a support on which said portion II is rested during the cutting operation. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> screw 20</span> may be adjusted, however, to allow the cutting edge I4 of blade l3 to move below foot portion H whenever it is desired to sharpen said cutting edge.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In using the device, the foot portion II is rested on a support and has its edge engaged beneath the work to be cut, whereupon the rear ends of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">s 5 and 6</span></span> are pressed toward each other so as to force the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> blade 13</span> downwardly and perform the cutting operation. When clipping ingrown toe nails, the edge of the foot portion H is engaged beneath the edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> toe nail 2</span>| and rested upon the adjacent portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> toe 22</span> as shown in Figure 6. As the depending blades are relatively long, the user need not reach down to a point in proximity to the work or nail being out.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As shown in Figure &#39;7, the front plate l3a may be adapted for direct connection to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> handle 6</span> so that the link plate l8 may be eliminated, although this will necessitate allowing slight forward and rearward movement of the upper end of said blade as it is moved in using the instrument.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As shown in Figure 8, a gang punch plate I3b may be provided for use in place of the front cutting blade, so that the instrument may be adapted for use in punching holes in leather goods, etc. This punch plate may have its lower end slotted as at 2| to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> provide spaced pointed punches 22</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   From the foregoing description, it is believed that the construction, operation and advantages of the present invention will be readily understood and appreciated by those skilled in the art. Further modifications and changes in details of construction are contemplated such as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> fairly fall 3</span> within the spirit and scope of the invention as claimed.   </p>
