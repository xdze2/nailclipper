                        <p>   This invention relates to finger nail clippers used by persons to remove the excess of growth of the finger or toe nails, or for other kindred purposes as a toilet implement.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is an object of this invention to produce a clip of special construction, having parts each of particular formation, and the whole of unique arrangement. It is believed the structure herein described is very simple in character, and cheap to manufacture and assemble, and it is a further object of this invention that when the parts are combined as set forth and are arranged in what is herein termed the closed position of the lever member there is no projecting point or edges or the like to catch in the pocket of the bearer. In the accompanying drawings the preferred construction of this invention is illustrated, and Fig. 1 represents a side view, slightly enlarged of the lever 0r file member. Fig. 2 is a view of the under side of the lever member showing the surface cross ridged as a nail file in the usual manner. Fig. 3 is a cross section of the lever member. Fig. 4 is a 2 side view of the upper and movable channel member. Fig. 5&#39;is a cross section of the channel member shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 6 is a side view of the lower channel member, and Fig. 7 is a cross section view thereof. Fig. 8 is a partly sectional view lengthwise of this invention showing the lever member in its operating position, and all parts assembled. Fig. 9 is a side viewshowing all parts assembled with the lever member in its closed position and showing also that one channel member occupies the other and the lever member occupies one of the channel members. The Fig. 10 is a top view of all parts assembled.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Throughout the drawings and description the same number is used to refer to the same.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   art. p Consider the drawings, a lever member 1 of angular form has a pointed e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nd 2 for use in</span>cleaning the nails, an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">d a file face </span>8 of any chosen design.

                        <p>  cross</span> section of thismemberis set out in Fig. 5. The channel opens upwardly.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The lower and wider channel member 8 has a flat end 9 of abo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">ut double the length of</span> the l<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">ike end of </span>the member 5, and the lower channel member has als<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">o a clipp</span>ing edge or end 10. The flat ends 6 of me<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">mbers 5 and 9 of member </span>8 are<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> welded one </span>upo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">n the o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">ther in s</span></span>uch<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> manner t</span>hat they are resiliently joined, and the upper channel member is normally sprung away from the lower channel member at their clipping ends as shown.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The parts are held together by means of a rotary stud 11, which is provided near the top<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> with an upward</span>ly inclined recess con-.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  structed to receive the pivot pin 4 of the lever member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the op<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">eration of t</span>his invention, if the lever member is in its operating position as illustrated in Fig. 8 it will when operated press the channel member 5 downwardly and close the clip<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">ping edges togeth</span>er with considerable force. In this position of the parts the file surface 8 of the lever member is exposed <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">for use. If whi</span>le the lever member is raised as set out in Fig. 8 it be swung around in a horizontal circle, the stud 11 will turn with it and the lever will e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">xtend to</span> the left hand side. In other words, the lever member 1 will now project oppositely fro<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">m the position </span>set forth in Fig. 8. Now, if the lever be turned over in a vertical plane it will be inverted and its position when closed will be that illustrated in Fig. 9. It will be understood that the lever member when in its closed position occupies the channel member 5, and the member 5 occupies th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">e channel member </span>8. Thus n<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">o rough s</span>urfaces or po<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">ints or corners a</span>re located outwardly and the whole is free from projections.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention is in no sense limited to the precise size, form or disposition of the parts disclosed as changes are believed&#39;to be readily devised after knowledge of this invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having now described this invention and its operation, I claim A finger nail clip, comprising two co-acting channel members, the channels of the said members opening in the same direction, one. of the said members being constructed to occupy the channel of the other member, each of said channel members having a clipping edge at one end, the said members being resiliently joined together, a lever member constructed to occupy an operating position and an inverted closed position, and means for pivotally connecting the said lever member with one of the channelmembers whereby the lever when operating presses upon the other channel member closing the said clipping edges, and the said lever mem-- her when in its closed position occupying the channel of the said member which occupies the channel of the other member.   </p>
