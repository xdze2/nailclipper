                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A cutting blade actuating link for actuating a cutting blade of a guillotine-type animal nail or artificial nail clipper. The link is in the form of a thin flat body having an integral hook formation at one end adapted for insertion into an aperture in the blade and a blade-release finger tab at the opposite end. The link hook has an inside peripheral edge concave surface to thereby define a hook eye interior surface inclined generally at an acute angle relative to the longitudinal axis of said body. The link has a dumb bell shaped through-opening for receiving both a pivot pin for mounting the blade to the clipper handle and the hook end of the clipper handle spring. Progressive die stamping method, apparatus and punch and die tooling are also disclosed for making the link. </p>

                        <p> FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This invention relates to a guillotine-type cutter useful as a nail clipper for trimming the nails of an animal, such as a dog or cat or for clipping natural or artificial finger or toe nails of a human, and more particularly to the cutting blade actuating linkage employed in such nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Professional quality animal nail clippers used by both veterinarians and animal owners in trimming the nails of animals, such as those of dogs and cats, have been successfully made and sold for over forty years under the trademark &#34;RESCO&#34; by Tecla Company, Incorporated of Walled Lake, Mich. Such clippers were initially made in accordance with the principles and features of the Laing U.S. Pat. No. 2,955,354 and later pursuant to the improvements of the Clark U.S. Pat. No. 3,838,507, both incorporated herein by reference. More recently a nail clipper of this type has been successfully modified for use in clipping human artificial fingernails by employing the principles and features of the Reiswig U.S. Pat. No. 4,856,190, also incorporated herein by reference. Other prior art patents of general interest directed to guillotine-type cutters and clippers are disclosed in the following U.S. patents:  </p>

                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      In general, the nail clippers made pursuant to the aforementioned Clark &#39;507 patent comprise a guillotine-type cutter with two blades. One blade is a movable cutting blade reciprocated in a single cutting stroke by manually squeezing together the handles of the clipper against the force of a biasing spring coupled between the handles. The second blade serves as the nail retainer blade and thus has an oblong, circular or other specially shaped opening to closely receive therethrough the nail to be cut, and is attached to the larger of the two handles with one or two screws or rivets. A blade actuating link (part 32 of the Clark &#39;507 patent and part 44 of the Reiswig &#39;190 patent) is operatively coupled between the clipper handles and the cutting blade so that when the user squeezes the two handles together, the link pushes the cutting blade forward on its cutting stroke so that it meshes with and travels by the retainer blade. The object to be cut (e.g., animal nail) is held in the retainer blade opening so that closing the clipper handles drives the cutting edge of the cutting blade through the object to sever it. The user then releases the clipper handles, allowing the spring to pull the link which in turn pulls the cutting blade back as the handles return to their fully opened position, ready for the next cutting stroke.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Based upon the aforementioned long commercial experience, it has been found that, for the nail cutting action to work properly, some of the essential operational features are: (1) the cutting blade has to have a sharp cutting edge; (2) the cutting blade has to slidably mesh tightly with the retainer blade during the entire cutting stroke; and (3) the cutting blade should travel for a substantial distance beyond the retainer blade opening to insure that the object is severed cleanly.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Typically the cutting blade is a flat part made from hardened tool steel or stainless steel in a progressive die stamping operation. The cutting blade is ground flat on one side and a cutting edge is ground the opposite-side, and has holes or slotted openings to releasably retain or accept the link adjacent its rearward end. The retainer blade is made of like material in a progressive die stamping operation likewise ground flat. Preferably, certain slight curvatures are imparted to the cutting blade and retaining blade surfaces, as described in conjunction with the embodiment of FIG. 7 of the Clark &#39;507 patent, to insure that the under surface of the cutting blade adjacent its cutting edge is forced closely against the upper surface of the nail holder as it slides therealong in the cutting stroke.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The large handle of the clipper typically is a stamped metal or plastic molded part to which the retainer blade is attached by one or two screws. The large handle carries a pivot pin pivotably supporting the small handle thereon.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The blade actuating link is a thin, flat progressive die stamped part that is pivotably attached near one end to the small handle, typically with a rivet. The link has a small hole adjacent the pivot pin connection to which one end of a extension coil spring is attached, the other end of the coil spring being hooked to the inside of the large handle to thereby yieldably pull the handles apart or to their fully opened positions. The forward end of the link has a notch forming a projection hook which extends through a hole in the cutting blade located near its rear edge. The material in the blade between the link hole and rear edge-of the blade forms a transverse bar extending across the link notch which the link alternately pushes and pulls on in the cutting and retraction strokes of the clipper. Although this crossed hook and bar means forms an easily releasable connection between the link and cutting blade, the link must also remain operable to alternatively push and pull the cutting blade during the blade cutting and retraction strokes respectively and therefore must stay engaged with the blade throughout these strokes and during stroke reversal.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      One of the unique features of this type of linkage, as set forth more fully in the aforementioned Clark &#39;507 patent, is that it is possible to remove the cutting blade without taking the assembly apart. The cutting blade is provided with an extra hole near its forward end for receiving a holding pin to temporarily hold the blade fixed in its extended position. The link has a tab protruding rearwardly beyond its handle pivot mounting which can be finger depressed to disengage the forward end of the link from the cutting blade and then be loosely abutted against the rear edge of the cutting blade. The retaining pin is then removed to thereby eject the cutting blade and the handles are then squeezed for easy removal from the clipper. The replacement blade can then be readily installed by reversing this procedure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Although the aforementioned &#34;RESCO&#34; nail clipper has long been commercially successful and accepted as &#34;the standard of the industry&#34; in the veterinary profession for animal nail trimming, nevertheless certain long standing problems have remained in its manufacture and use, centering around the construction of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> link 32</span> of the Clark &#39;507 patent and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> corresponding link 44</span> of the Reiswig &#39;197 patent. These links have a contour with a rectangular notch or recess near the forward end, i.e.,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> notch 36</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> &#39;507 patent link 32</span> defined by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> pushing surface 42</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> bottom bearing surface 44</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> pulling surface 46</span> which engage the portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> cutting blade 26</span> between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> cutting blade hole 40</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem69"> rear edge 69</span> of the blade, and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> similarly notch 48</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> link 44</span> of the &#39;190 patent. This hook configuration works adequately during the forward or cutting stroke. However, on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> occasion link 32</span> inadvertently can be pulled out of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> cutting blade 26</span> on the retract or opening stroke, if the cutting blade becomes bound or otherwise restricted during this stroke. Also, if the nail trimmer is inadvertently dropped by the user, the link will sometimes disengage itself from the cutting blade, thereby creating a nuisance for the user and a possibly serious interference during some nail trimming circumstances.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In one proposal to solve this unwanted unhooking problem, it was suggested that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> front wall 46</span> of the notch was to be ground after stamping to provide an acute angle or undercut to create a camming effect so that the link would more readily stay removably engaged in the cutting blade. However this would be a very labor intensive operation which would add considerable manufacturing expense to the clipper. Although this undercut angle alternatively could be imparted in the progressive die operation, thereby eliminating a grinding operation, this would cause die wear and breakage problems. Also, whether undercut or not, the rectangular configuration of the notch at the front of the link has caused added expense in the manufacture of the precision punch dies and made them prone to breakage, and also made the part as punched susceptible to burrs. Likewise, the outer perimeter of the die punch in the vicinity of the notch has areas with straight intersections at the corner that make the punch die susceptible to undue wear and breakage problems.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Another problem experienced with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> link 32</span> of the Clark &#39;507 patent arises from the provision of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> small diameter hole 56</span>, which receives the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55"> end hook 55</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> tension coil spring 30</span>, and another small diameter hole which receives the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> pivot <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">pin 34</span> for pivotally coupling link 32</span> to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> small handle 12</span>. These two small diameter holes require delicate punches to form the same, leading to manufacturing problems of punch breakage and/or formation of burred holes.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Another problem encountered with these small diameter link holes is &#34;slug return&#34;. Slug return occurs when the slug of metal punched out by the punch from the sheet metal strip blank clings to the punch on the downstroke (piercing stroke) and then remains on the punch during retraction above the die section, instead of being stripped and ejected below the blank as intended. This in turn can, and often does, cause the strip stock being stepwise fed through the progressive die press to jam up, thereby requiring the press to be stopped and the die cleared before production can resume. Slug return thus represents an expensive problem whenever it is encountered in production.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved guillotine-type cutter of the aforementioned type and an improved cutting blade actuating link therefor which overcome the aforementioned problems in an efficient and reliable manner, while retaining the desirable feature of the cutting blade being readily removable and replaceable by hand without disassembly of the clipper as in the aforementioned successful prior art &#39;507 patent clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Another object is to provide an improved blade actuating link for use in nail clippers of the type disclosed in the aforementioned &#39;507 and &#39;190 patents which overcomes the aforementioned problems, and which is directly substitutable for the prior blank actuating link of such existing commercial clippers without requiring any other change in the construction of the remaining parts of such clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Yet another object is to provide an improved blade actuating link of the aforementioned character which is smoother acting and longer lasting in operation than the prior link described above, and which is less expensive to manufacture and more reliable in operation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A further object of this invention is to provide an improved method of manufacturing a cutting blade actuating link of the aforementioned character and an improved punch and die apparatus for performing this method, and which cooperate with the improved link construction to overcome the aforementioned problems encountered in manufacture of the prior link in a more efficient, economical and reliable manner, both with respect to the operation of the apparatus in performance of the method and construction of the apparatus employed to perform the method.  </p>

It will be seen that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> dumb bell opening 130</span> thus provides a dual engagement opening in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> for<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> operably interconnecting both pivot pin 34</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55"> spring hook 55</span> with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> to function in the manner previously requiring the two separate small diameter circular openings (i.e.,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> unnumbered hole for pin 34</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> hole 5<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">6</span> for spring end hook 55</span>) in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> prior link 32</span>, of the Clark &#39;507 patent.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Hook 102</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> is releasably engaged with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> by insertion in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> blade opening 40</span> so as to protrude therethrough and is operable to exert the push-pull blade actuating forces imparted to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> by squeezing together and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> then r<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">eleasing clipper handles 12 and 16</span></span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> thereby respectively advancing blade 26</span> on its cutting stroke and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> retracting blade 26</span> on its return stroke. The respective retracted positions of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> are shown in FIGS. 1, 3 and 4. The relative positions of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> nail retainer 18</span> during the push-mode in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> advancing blade 26</span> on its cutting stroke are partially shown in sequence in FIGS. 7A, 7B and 7C. Similarly, the relative positions of these parts during the pull-mode in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> retracting blade 26</span> on its return stroke are partially shown in sequence in FIGS. 8A and 8B.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring in more detail to FIG. 7A,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> is illustrated generally at the angulation relative to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> corresponding to the fully opened position of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">s 12 and 16</span></span> shown in FIG. 1. As the closing force is applied to the handles by the user manually squeezing the same together,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> pivot <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">pin 34</span> pushes link 100</span> in the forward direction as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> pin 34</span> is forcibly carried by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> handle 12</span> to bodily swing about the axis of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> handle pivot pin 14</span>. This<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> causes link 100</span> to move bodily from the position shown in FIG. 7A through the position of FIG. 7B to the position of FIG.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> 7C (handles fully closed blade 26</span> fully advanced to the end limit of its cutting stroke). The reaction forces exerted on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> (initially low due only to the frictional resistance to its sliding motion and then high due to the much greater resistance offered by the object being cut and severed by the blade while held by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> holder 18</span>) produce a sliding abutment-type engagement between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem92"> lower rear corner edge 92</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> and the portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> link eye surface 114</span> contiguous with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116"> link corner radius surface 116</span> generally where they meet and form an &#34;S&#34; curvature. A slight clearance remains between<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> hook end surface 106</span> and the adjacent forward edge surface of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> blade latch hole 40</span> when the link is pushing the blade during push stroke. Since the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> link a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">butment surfaces 114 and 116</span></span> present a smoothly curved surface,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem92"> blade latch edge 9<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">2</span> can readily slide along surface 114</span> to accommodate the changing angulation between the link and blade during this push stroke. It is also to be understood that the tension force exerted by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> spring 30</span> on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> develops a hook en<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">gagement retaining torque about pivot pin 34</span> tending to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> contin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">uously urge link 100</span> against blade 126</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120"> fo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">rce link hook 120</span> into blade hole 40</span> throughout both the push and pull strokes of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As the user begins to release the grip on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">s 12 and 16</span></span> to initiate the blade retraction stroke,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> hook 102</span> will be drawn to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> move within blade hole 40</span> to the left, away from its relative position in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> blade hole 40</span> shown in FIG. 7C,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> thereby causing link hook surface 114</span> to slidably hook-engage the rear edge of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> blade hole 40</span> as shown in FIG. 8A. More particularly, the slight resistance to return motion of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> will cause the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150"> rear upper edge 150</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> blade hole 40</span> to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> engage h<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">ook eye surface 114</span> adjacent point 104</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> link hook 102</span>. Due to the curvature angulation of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> hook eye surface 114</span> in this area relative to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span>, a resultant camming force will be developed in response to the link pull force tending to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> force hook 102</span> to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> enter further into blade hole 40</span>, and which is cumulative to the hooking fore of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> spring 30</span>, thereby insuring a firm latch hooking engagement of the link<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> and blade for reliably retracting blade 26</span> throughout its return stroke (as seen in FIGS. 8A and 8B as well as FIG. 1) without danger of the pop-out disengagement occurring as discussed previously.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It thus will be seen from the foregoing that<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> have a releasable latch-type engagement, as well as a push-pull force transmitting engagement. That is, the blade material in the rear portion of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> defined between the rear upper and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150"> lower <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90">edges 150 and 90</span></span> respectively of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> blade latch hole 40</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem92"> lower rear corner edge 92</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem69"> rear edge surface 69</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> forms and functions as a &#34;latch bar&#34; that is releasably received within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> eye 112</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> latch hook 102</span> and extends perpendicular to the major plane of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> line 100</span>. This rear edge latch bar material of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> also provides the driven coupling member cooperative with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> driving hook 102</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> in the foregoing &#34;push-pull&#34; blade actuations.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In addition,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> since spring 30</span> is designed and constructed to exert a continuous tension force on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55"> spring hook 55</span> will always remain securely attached to the link within the upper end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> link opening 130</span> (as viewed in FIGS. 1, 3 and 4) and will readily slide along the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem134"> smoothly curved surface 134</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> opening 130</span> during the changing angulation of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> relative to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span>. Also,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> because pivot pin 34</span> has a diameter which cannot pass through the narrow space defined between the hour-glass shaped &#34;waist&#34;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem136"> surfac<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem138">es 136 and 138</span></span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> opening 130</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> pin 34</span> will remain captured in the lower end of the &#34;dumb bell&#34;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> shaped opening 130</span> regardless of the direction and/or magnitude of the forces exerted between<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem134"> pin 134</span>. However due to the tension exerted by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> spring 30</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> pin 34</span> will be forced to ride continuously in the closed end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem132"> smoothly curved surface 132</span> during both closing and opening of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">s 12 and 16</span></span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Method and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> Apparatus for Manufacturing Link 100</span>  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In accordance with a further feature of the present invention,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> is preferably manufactured utilizing the improved tooling apparatus of the invention operated to perform the improved method of the invention as illustrated in FIGS. 11-21. This method is preferably performed utilizing a commercially available progressive die stamping machine of conventional construction (not shown) having a conventional stock feeder (not shown) which is operable to intermittently feed a coil of steel strip stock in flat form in precisely controlled equal increments through the punch and die station of the press, as will be well understood by those skilled in this art. However, special punch and die tooling constructed and arranged in accordance with the present invention is provided in such a progressive die stamping press as shown in FIGS. 11-21.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring first to the semi-schematical illustration of FIG. 11, the punch and die tooling of the invention includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200"> die holder 200</span> and an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202"> associated punch holder 202</span> which are respectively fixtured in a stationary die bed support structure of the press and in a vertically reciprocable platen punch support structure of the press in the usual manner. In FIG. 11 the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202"> punch holder 202</span> is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90"> shown bodily rotated up 90</span>Â° from its normal horizontal position to facilitate illustration and understanding of the punch tooling, it being understood that in normal use the axes of the punches are oriented facing vertically downwardly and parallel to the vertical travel of the punch platen of the press. FIG. 11 also fragmentarially illustrates the flat strip of 204 of steel starting stock as it is fed toward the punch and die tooling of the press in the direction of the travel arrow T. The conventional strip feeder is operated such that<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span> is advanced or indexed the same fixed distance each time it is intermittently fed, in accordance with conventional practice. In accordance with the mode of operation of the punch and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200"> die to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">oling 200, 202</span></span> of the invention, and pursuant to practicing the steps of the method of the invention, the punch and die tooling is constructed and arranged in six sequential operation stations labeled as stations #1, #2, #3, #4, #5 and #6 in FIG. 11. The progressive punching and piloting operations performed simultaneously and sequentially on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span> in these stations are illustrated to scale in the corresponding fragmentary views of FIGS. 12A through 12F in which the punch tooling is shown in transverse cross section, as will be explained in more detail hereinafter.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Station #1  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In Station #1 (FIGS. 11 and 12A), two openings are simultaneously punched and finish formed in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span>. The smaller of these two openings, i.e.,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> dumb bell shaped opening 130</span>, is oriented in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span> to subsequently serve as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> opening 130</span> in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span>. The larger of these two openings,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> opening 206</span>, is also a &#34;dumb bell&#34; shaped opening. Each of the opposite round ends of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> opening 206</span> have the same constant radius of curvature and hence diametrical dimension and each being equal to the diameter of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> link hook opening 112</span>. The upper left end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> opening 206</span> (as viewed in FIG. 12A) thus as punched has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> surface 114</span>&#39; which is oriented in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> strip 20</span> to subsequently serve as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> hook eye surface 114</span> in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span>. The orientation and spacing of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> two op<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206">enings 130 and 206</span></span> formed in Station #1 is thus coincident to the orientation of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> opening 130</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> hook eye surface 114</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> finished linked 100</span>. The punching pattern is laid out relative to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span> such that the major axis of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> to be formed therein (see FIG. 12D) is transverse to the longitudinal axis of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span> (and to the direction of strip travel T) and at an angle of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80"> about 80</span>Â° relative thereto, to thereby optimize pattern nesting in the strip for minimizing scrap waste.  </p>

                        <p>      Referring again to FIGS. 11-13, in Station #2 (FIG. 12B) the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> strip <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130">holes 206 and 130</span></span> which were punched in Station #1 (FIG. 12A) have been advanced in travel direction T from Station #1 and are now registered in Station #2 (the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> left h<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130">and holes 206 and 130</span></span> as viewed in FIG. 12B) by causing one increment of travel feed of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span> while the punch tooling has been raised clear of the strip. On the next down stroke of the punch tooling a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300"> piloting pin 300</span> (FIG. 11) is inserted into and through the upper circular end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> strip hole 206</span> with a precision sliding fit.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300"> Pin 300</span> thus slidably bears against the surface of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span> which is to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> become hook surface 114</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> as finished.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">  </p>

                        <p>      The pointed entrance of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300"> pin 300</span> through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> strip hole 206</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304"> in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">to die hole 304</span> enables pilot pin 300</span> to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> slightly shift strip 204</span> as necessary to insure accurate registry of the entire strip layout with the precision placement of the punch and die tooling.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300"> Pilot pin 300</span> thus cooperates with the precision punching operations in Stations #1, #4 and #6 as the punch and die apparatus is cycled repetitively in sequence with the incremental advance of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span> through the press. The sliding movement of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300"> pin 300</span> through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> hole 206</span> also helps burnish the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> hook surface 114</span> subsequent to the initial punching thereof in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> station 1</span> (FIG. 12A).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Station #3  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to FIG. 12C as well as FIG. 11, in Station #3 the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> strip <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130">holes 206 and 130</span></span> as punched in Station #1 have been further advanced in travel direction T from Station #2 and are now registered in Station #3 (again the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> left-h<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130">and holes 206 and 130</span></span> as viewed in FIG. 12C). Again, this occurs in timed relationship with incremental strip feed and press stroke repetitive cycling. Station #3 includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310"> second pilot pin 310</span> which enters the upper end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> strip hole 206</span> as generaly registered in this station by the strip feeder, continues downwardly through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span> into another<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem312"> die hole 312</span> provided in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200"> die platen 200</span> coaxially with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310"> pin 310</span> in Station #3.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310"> Pilot pin 310</span> is identical to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300"> pilot pin 300</span> and likewise has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem314"> pointed end 314</span> (FIG. 11) to provide entry camming action for its cylindrical shank to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310"> thereby further assist pin 310</span> in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> registering strip 204</span> accurately with the punch and die tooling in Stations #1, #4 and #6.

                        <p>      Station #4 Press Punch and Die  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to FIGS. 12D and 11, in Station #4 the final step is performed in blanking the form of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span>. Station #4 is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320"> blanking punch 320</span> having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem322"> flat end face 322</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324"> shank 324</span> of longitudinally constant cross sectional thickness of the same contour as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem322"> face 322</span>. The contour of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320"> punch 320</span> is identical to the layout of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> as seen in the plan view thereof in FIG. 5 except for one important difference. Instead of following the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> hook eye 112</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320"> punch 320</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem330"> portion 330</span> (FIG. 12D) which fills this area of the link layout to provide a shear line bridging the central neck of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> strip opening 206</span> as registered in Station #4.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Station #4 is also provided with a complimentary blanking die forming an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem326"> opening 326</span> in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200"> die plate 200</span> having the same contour as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320"> punch 320</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem326"> Die opening 326</span> extends completely through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200"> die plate 200</span> and registers with a part catching chute (not shown) of the punch and die apparatus.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem326"> Die opening 326</span> is also made uniformly slightly oversize relative to the contour of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320"> punch 320</span> in accordance with the conventional punch and die tooling clearance criteria.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Station #4 Operation  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In the operation of Station #4, the pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> strip <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206">holes 130 and 206</span></span> which were punched in Station #1 and then successively advanced through and piloted in Stations #2 and #3 have been further advanced in travel direction T and are now registered in Station #4. The registered position of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> strip hole 130</span> is shown in hidden lines in FIG. 12D and is positioned entirely within the outline of the contour of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320"> punch 320</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem326"> associated die opening 326</span>. However, only that portion of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> strip hole 206</span> shown in hidden lines in FIG. 12D is registered within the punch and die opening contour. The remaining half of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> strip hole 206</span> overlies the flat upper surface of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200"> die block 200</span> on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> which strip 204</span> slides, and hence this half of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> strip hole 206</span> is positioned out of registry with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem326"> die opening 326</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Hence, as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320"> punch 320</span> is forced downwardly on its working stroke in Station #4 to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem322"> bring punch face 322</span> flat against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320"> punch 320</span> will strike and shear punch downwardly from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span> a finished workpiece having the final contour and configuration of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As seen in FIG. 12D (as well as in FIGS. 12E and 12F), it will be noted that the portion of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320"> punch 320</span> indicated at 330 bridges the central neck of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> strip opening 206</span> as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> it pierce blanks strip 204</span> to thereby leave open the mouth of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> link hook eye opening 112</span>, (see also FIG. 5). The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> finished link 100</span> thus sheared from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span> is driven downwardly through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem326"> die opening 326</span> into the part collection chute and thereby cleared from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Station #5  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to FIGS. 12E and 11, Station #5 is an &#34;empty&#34; station containing no punch or pilot tooling or associated die openings. Thus, as seen in FIG. 12E, the contour of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem332"> blanked-out opening 332</span> in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span> as previously and progressively formed by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem230"> piercing portion 230</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214"> punch 214</span> and by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320"> punch 320</span> in Stations #1 and #4 respectively, has been advanced in travel direction T from Station #4 by the next macine cycle to now occupy the empty space of Stations #5. Since Station #5 is thus an &#34;empty&#34; station, it advantageously provides a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> separation zone along strip 204</span> to thereby allow the sufficient intervening metal structural to be provided in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200"> die block 200</span> for adequate strength in the die block material between the concurrent punch blanking and cut-off operations occurring simultaneously in Stations #4 and #6 respectively.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Station #6 Punch and Die Tooling and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> Operation  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Station 6</span> constitutes the last operating station of the punch and die tooling apparatus of the invention, as well as the last step of the method of the invention involved in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> forming link 100</span>. Referring to FIGS. 12F and 11, the Station #6 punch and die tooling comprises a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem340"> cut-off punch 340</span> having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem342"> flat bottom face 342</span> and a stepped cut-off edge consisting of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem344"> straight portion 344</span> an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem346"> angled portion 346</span> and another<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem348"> straight portion 348</span> offset from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem344"> portion 344</span> as defined by the intersection therewith of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem344"> corresponding punch side surfaces 344</span>&#39;, 346&#39;, 348&#39; (FIG. 12F).<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Die holder 200</span> has a corresponding downstream cut-off edge defined by the intersection of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem350"> edge e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem352">nd surf<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem354">aces 350, 352 and 354</span></span></span> perpendicularly with the upper face of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200"> die holder 200</span>, and which are complimental to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem344"> punch side faces 344</span>&#39;, 346&#39; and 348&#39; respectively.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem340"> Punch 340</span> and the left hand edge of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200"> die holder 200</span> are oriented and cooperate with the intermittent strip feed of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem322"> strip opening 322</span> from Stations #5 to Station #5 to form a stag<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204">gered cut-off line which intersects strip 204</span> at the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem356"> narrow<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem358">est points 356 and 358</span></span> in the opposite side margins of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span>. FIG. 13 illustrates the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem370"> scrap piece 370</span> severed from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span> in Station #6, with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem356"> companion shear lines 356</span>&#39; and 358&#39; indicated thereon. Hence, the only strip portions severed are those remaining between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem360"> right hand longitudinal edge 360</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span> (as viewed in direction T strip travel) and the closest adjacent portion of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem332"> strip opening 332</span>; and between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem362"> left hand edge 362</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span> and the closest adjacent surface of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem332"> strip opening 332</span>. The location of these strip cut off points thus minimizes the amount of strip material to be severed to achieve the end cut-off function at the downstream end of the strip feeding apparatus.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As will now be understood from the foregoing, operation of the punch and die apparatus of the invention described previously with reference to FIGS. 11-21, as operated to preform the steps of the method of the invention, enables continuous, rapid and economical manufacture of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> links 100</span> with precision accuracy on a mass production basis with a minimum of scrap loss.

                        <p>      Referring to FIG. 9, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> modified cutting blade link 100</span>&#39; is illustrated in side elevational view which is identical in outside contour to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> prior cutting blade link 100</span>, utilized in the nail clipper of the aforementioned Clark &#39;507 patent and described previously hereinabove, except for having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> modified hook portion 102</span>&#39; and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104"> associated modified point 104</span>&#39; and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> hook eye edge surface 114</span>&#39;.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> Link 100</span>&#39; has the same<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116"> pushing edge 116</span> as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span>. Instead of providing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> two se<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">parate circular holes 40 and 74</span></span> (for engagement with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> release pin 70</span> of the &#39;507 patent respectively),<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> need only be provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> one opening 40</span> since when it is used with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span>&#39; the blade is non-releasable.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Link 100</span>&#39; is made by the same method as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> but has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> somewhat longer hook portion 102</span>&#39;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> than portion 102</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> so that its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104"> pointed end 104</span>&#39;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116"> protrudes further toward surface 116</span> so that<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> hook 102</span>&#39; can not be withdrawn from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> blade hole 40</span> by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> pivoting link 102</span>&#39; by finger release pressure on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem128"> tab 12<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">8</span> while link 102</span>&#39; is in assembled operable relation with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> pin 34</span> in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> clipper 10</span>. However,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> link 102</span>&#39; can be initially installed in subassembled hooked relation with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> orienting link 102</span>&#39; upwardly beyond its operational angular range of orientation to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> when in final assembly with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> clipper 10</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Further Features and Advantages  </p>
                    
                        <p>      From the foregoing description, it will now be apparent that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> improved link 100</span>, and improved method and apparatus for making the same in accordance with the invention as described and illustrated previously herein, amply fulfill the aforestated objects as well as providing many novel features and advantages over<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> link 32</span> of the Clark &#39;507 patent and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> corresponding link 44</span> of the Reiswig &#39;190 patent.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> Link 100</span> is directly substitutable as replacement for either of these aforementioned prior art links without requiring any change in the remaining existing structure of the commercial animal nail clipper and artificial human nail clipper of these respective patents. This is a major advantage in and of itself.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is to be noted in this regard that the illustration of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> retainer 20</span> in FIGS. 1 and 3 of the Reiswig &#39;190 patent is incorrect insofar as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> retainer 20</span>, as correctly shown in FIG. 5 of the Reiswig &#39;190 patent and as used commercially, terminates at its rearward end flush with the rearward end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> spacer 26</span>, i.e., it does not extend rearwardly of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> spacer 26</span> over<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade 24</span> as shown in FIGS. 1 and 3. Hence in practice there is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> adequate space above blade 24</span> for the provide clearance to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> upwardly protruding hook 102</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> when the same<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> replaces link 44</span> in accordance with the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> mouth or eye 112</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> hook 102</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span>, being defined by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> circular surface 114</span>, and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180"> extending more than 180</span>Â°, provides a curved undercut surface relative to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104"> hook end 104</span> which insures that<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104"> hook 104</span> will more securely &#34;wrap around&#34;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> cutting blade 26</span> during pulling engagement of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> on the retraction stroke (referring to FIGS. 8A and 8B) than was possible with the rectangular notch in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> prior <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">links 32 or 44</span></span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> Hence link 100</span> has a much greater resistance to pulling out of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> cutting blade 26</span> than the prior links even when such were provided with a flat undercut angle on the lower face of the rectangular notch. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> semi-circular eye recess 112</span> in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> blade 100</span> acts like a fish hook, and provides a greater retaining angle than in the prior art acute angle links.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104"> Link nose 104</span> protrudes a slight distance above the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80"> upper face 80</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> (as viewed in FIGS. 1 and 4) and is reliably maintained in this attitude by both the force of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> spring 30</span> as well as the resolution of forces developed between<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> on the retraction stroke. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> curved link hook 102</span> thus insures that<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> cannot be pulled out of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> cutting blade 26</span> on the retraction stroke even if the blade binds or is restricted during the retraction stroke. Moreover,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> will remain engaged with the blade even if the trimmer is inadvertently dropped by the user, whereas the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> prior <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">links 32 and 44</span></span> will sometimes disengage from the cutting blade when such dropage occurs.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> addition eye surface 114</span> provides a smooth bearing contour over the angular range of blade engagement because it is a curved surface with a constant radius of curvature and also because it is a smooth surface due to being produced by the circular punch surface of one of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem232"> lobes <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem234">232, 234</span></span> and due to the subsequent burnishing action in two stages by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300"> pilot <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">pins 300 and 310</span></span>. Hence the clipper action is smoother and less frictional resistance forces are developed in its operation.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Link 100</span> also retains the major advantage of easy blade removal without taking the clipper assembly apart,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> Link 100</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem128"> large tab 128</span> at its rearward end easily finger operated for pivoting the front end of the link completely out of engagement with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> cutting blade 26</span>, as set forth in the Clark &#39;507 patent.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> Link 100</span> also can be positioned behind the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem69"> rear edge 69</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> nose surface 106</span> abutting thereagainst to push the cutting blade and thereby completely eject the same by squeezing the clipper handles.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> Hence link 100</span> works for this purpose at least as well as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> prior link 32</span> when replaced in the animal nail clipper structure of the Clark &#39;507 patent.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The configuration and construction of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> also cooperates with the improved method and apparatus of the invention in providing further advantages. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> prior <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">links 32 and 44</span></span> had two small diameter holes for respectively receiving the handle pivot pin and spring hook that required correspondingly small and hence delicate pierce punches to form the same, thereby causing punch breakage problems and/or burr holes. This also led to problems with &#34;slug return&#34;. By contrast,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> has a fish hook configuration for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> front blade engaging eye opening 112</span>. Because this opening is a segment of a circle, it is easier to stamp, and the larger diameter punch and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214"> die to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">oling 214 and 210</span></span> will hold up longer in production.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Moreover, the two small diameter holes of the prior link are replaced in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> with the much larger &#34;dumb bell&#34;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> shaped opening 130</span>. Hence a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem216"> single punch 216</span> can be employed having a rigid cross sectional configuration and substantially greater cross sectional area than the old small diameter hole punches. Likewise the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem220"> die opening 220</span> is much larger than those of the prior dies. This makes the punch and die tooling easier and less expensive to construct and much more rigid and strong, thereby providing greater accuracy and longer life in use of the tooling. Not only is the punch more durable because of its larger size, it produces less burrs on the parts because of the improved ratio of hole size to stock thickness, and the holes as punched are much more uniform in production.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Another and unexpected advantage of the provision of the &#34;figure 8&#34; or &#34;dumb bell&#34; cross sectional configuration provided in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214"> punche<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem216">s 214 and 216</span></span> is the elimination of the aforementioned slug return problem that occurred frequently with the prior small diameter punches. &#34;Slug return&#34; can cause the strip stock to jam up so that the press must be stopped and the die cleared before production can be resumed. This expensive and costly procedure is eliminated by the method, apparatus and actuating link configuration working in cooperation with one another in accordance with the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Additionally, although it might at first must seem wasteful to punch an &#34;oversize&#34;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> opening 206</span> in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204"> strip 204</span> when only half of this opening is utilized in the final product, i.e.,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> opening 112</span> in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span>, the &#34;unused&#34; portion of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206"> hole 206</span> does not thereby create an increase in scrap loss because of the efficient nesting pattern provided in the progression punching layout, as best seen in FIGS. 12E and 12F. On the other hand, this &#34;oversize&#34; opening feature enables the advantageous use of the large cross section &#34;figure 8&#34;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214"> punch 214</span> with its generous radii of curvature, making the punch easier to build and maintain.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The smaller &#34;figure 8&#34;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214"> punch 214</span> also has these corresponding advantages, and yet the resulting &#34;figure 8&#34; shape of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> opening 130</span>, with its narrow but open central waist works as well as the two pr<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">ior small holes for retaining spring hook 55</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> pivot pin rivet 34</span>. It is to be noted in this regard that, as best seen in FIGS. 1 and 4, the thrust and reaction forces exerted between<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> pivot pin 34</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> during both the push and pull modes of operation of the clipper are directed against the circular surface at the associated end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> opening 130</span> rather than toward the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem136"> centra<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem138">l surfaces 136 and 138</span></span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> opening 130</span>. The same action is true relative to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55"> spring hook 55</span> and the opposite circular end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> opening 130</span>. Hence the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130"> single dual-purpose hole 130</span> works at least as well as the prior two small holes in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> link 32</span> with respect to the retention and engagement of the associated spring and pivot pin parts.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The perimeter configuration of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> provides further advantages in production and operation of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span>. The perimeter of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> hook 102</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> hook e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">ye 112</span> link 100</span> has generous radii at the intersections of all of its corners, as contrasted with the right angle intersections at the corners of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> notch <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">surface<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">s 42, 44 and 46</span></span></span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> link 32</span> and as illustrated in the Clark &#39;507 patent. Hence the problems posed by the prior punch perimeter configuration, with its straight edges and right angle or acute angle corners that were susceptible of die breakage and excessive wear, are also overcome. Moreover,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> link nose 102</span>, which forms the outside of a fish hook configuration, has a g<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">enerous radius which makes blanking punch 320</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem326"> associated die opening 326</span> easier to construct and maintain.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> Because mouth 112</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> is made circular and on a constant radius of curvature,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> surface 114</span> can be made to a closer tolerance than could be obtained with the prior rectangular notch opening of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> link 32</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Obtaining these closer tolerances in production also means there is less play or gap in the engagement between<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> cutting blade 26</span>. This not only produces a smoother action during the cutting stroke; it also enables increased travel because of the reduced lost motion produced between<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> when push/pull reversal occurs at the end of the cutting stroke of the blade. This in turn enables the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> cutting blade 26</span> to be made to a slightly shorter length, thereby saving material cost in production of the blade.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A still further increase in blade travel is made possible by the improved configuration of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> nose 102</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span>. The outside radius defined by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> hook surface 106</span>, as well as the inside radius defined by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> surface 114</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> enables nose 102</span> to be made thinner in the major plane of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> than the corresponding portion of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> prior link 32</span>. Hence there is less metal between the cutting blade and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> link hook 102</span> when the same engages the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> stop 52</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> retainer 18</span> at the end of the cutting stroke. Consequently, blade travel is increased, thereby enabling the cutting blade to be made even shorter to thereby provide further material savings.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is to be understood that the aforementioned features and advantages of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> improved link 100</span> of the invention, and the improved apparatus and method for manufacture of the same in accordance with the invention, are equally applicable with respect to use of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span> as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> replacement for link 44</span> in the artificial or natural human nail clipper of the aforementioned Reiswig &#39;190 patent, resulting in a corresponding reduction in manufacturing cost and improvement in its ease and reliability of operation and greater useful life.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It will also be understood that<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">00</span> (or 100</span>&#39;) could be made from much thinner sheet stock, and two or more of such thinner links used in side-by-side assembly in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> clipper 10</span> to conjointly provide<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> sufficient strength for actuating blade 26</span>. Such multi-ply links may be adhesively laminated or otherwise suitably fixed together if desired, but need not be since they are trapped to operate in loose side-by-side relationship by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> pin 34</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55"> spring hook 55</span>, as well as by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> blade hole 40</span> when in operable assembly in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> clipper 10</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Also the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> hook 102</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">00</span> may be bent toward eye surface 116</span> as a final operation after subassembly to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> in order to provide the type of non-release engagement therewith as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> link 100</span>&#39; when in operable assembly in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> clipper 10</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Further,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade 26</span> can be made with a straight or other form of cutting edge if desired for certain cutting applications, such as in the aforementioned Reiswig &#39;190 patent.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is also to be understood that, although the foregoing description and drawings describe and illustrate in detail a successful working embodiment of the present invention, to those skilled in the art to which the present invention relates the present disclosure will suggest many modifications and constructions as well as widely different embodiments and applications without thereby departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The present invention, therefore, is intended to be limited only by by the scope of the appended claims and the applicable prior art. </p>
