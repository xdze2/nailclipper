                        <p> CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS  </p>
                    
                        <p>    This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/277,793, filed on Mar. 21, 2001, which is incorporated by reference.  </p>
                    
                        <p>  </p>
                    
                        <p>  </p>
                    
                        <p>    BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The present invention is related to the field of spring-biased nippers, and more specifically to the manner in which the nipper handles are biased apart.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Conventional nippers, such as those for cutting toe nails or cuticles, comprise a pair of handles connected for pivoting movement relative to one another. One side of the nipper cutting jaw extends beyond the pivot point on each handle so that when the handles are brought together, the jaws close and cut. Biasing means are provided between the handles to bias them apart so that after a user squeezes the handles together to cause the jaws to cut, the handles move apart when the user&#39;s grip is relaxed thus opening the cutting jaws and readying the nippers for the next cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    One prior art nipper biasing means comprises a single leaf spring affixed to one handle and having an end which abuts the other handle. Although the spring provides biasing, the spring is relatively stiff, which causes wear as the spring moves against the handle, and also results in occasional breaking of the spring.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Another prior art biasing device comprises a pair of leaf springs each having one end affixed to opposing nipper handles with each of the other spring ends connected to each other between the handles. This also is relatively stiff and like the single leaf spring is labor intensive to assemble.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The invention will become more readily apparent from the following Detailed Description, which proceeds with reference to the drawings, in which:  </p>

                        <p>      BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  </p>
                    
                        <p>        FIG. 1  is a perspective view of a nipper of the prior art that uses a pair of leaf springs.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        FIG. 2  is a perspective view of a nipper of the prior art that uses a single leaf spring.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        FIG. 3  is a perspective view of a nipper constructed according to the present disclosure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        FIG. 4  is a side view of the nipper of  FIG. 3  with squeezing pressure applied to the handles.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        FIG. 5  is a side view of the nipper of  FIG. 3  with no squeezing pressure applied to the handles.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        FIG. 6  is a side view of the nipper of  FIG. 3 , with lever member removed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>     </p>
                    
                        <p>  </p>
                    
                        <p>  </p>
                    
                        <p>    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,214,854 (to Mennicken) (incorporated herein by reference for all purposes) teaches a nipper having a helical spring operative to outwardly bias the nipper handles. Like numerals that identify nipper structures in the drawings of the &#39;854 patent correspond to similar structures in the present application.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIG. 1  is a perspective view of a prior art double-spring biased nipper, and  FIG. 2  is a perspective view of a prior art single-spring biased nipper. In each of the drawings, the same numeral identifies corresponding structure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Considering first the prior art nipper of  FIG. 1 , a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">springs  20</span> ,  22  are each attached to the inside of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">second nipper handles  12</span> ,  14 , respectively, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">via screws  24</span> ,  26 , respectively, which are each threadably engaged in a bore (not visible) formed in the associated nipper handle. The nipper comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">spring  20</span>  that includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">notch  28</span>  formed at one end thereof. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span> , secured to the second handle, has <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">tab  30</span>  that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">engages notch  28</span>  in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">spring  20</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Turning now to the prior art nipper of  FIG. 2 , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">single spring  32</span>  is secured to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handle  12</span>  by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">screw  34</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">Spring  32</span>  comprises a single-leaf spring that includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">bearing surface  36</span> . The bearing surface rides against an inner surface of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">handle  14</span> , not visible in the view of FIG.  2 . As the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handles  12</span> ,  14  are squeezed together, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">surface  36</span>  rides along the inner surface of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">handle <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> 14</span>  toward jaws  16</span> ,  18 . As the handles move together, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">they compress or flex leaf spring  32</span> , thereby creating a biasing force that urges the handles outwardly to the position shown in  FIG. 2  when the nipper handles are released.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    In operation, when <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handles  12</span> ,  14  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nipper  10</span>  are squeezed together, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">springs  20</span> ,  22  bend in a manner that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">moves notch  28</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">tab  30<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"></span>  toward jaws  16</span> ,  18  while remaining engaged with one another. Similarly, the portions of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">springs  20</span> ,  22  that are <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">not held against nipper handles  12</span> ,  14 , respectively, move toward the nipper handles. This creates a spring biasing force so that when the handles are released, they are biased back into an open position as shown in FIG.  1 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Turning now to  FIG. 3 , indicated generally at  38  is a nipper constructed in accordance with the present invention. Included therein is a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">spring  40</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">first end  42</span>  of which is secured to the inner surface of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handle  12</span>  by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">screw  24</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">spring  40</span>  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">arcuate portion  46</span>  positioned proximate a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">second end  44</span> . It can be seen that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">spring  40</span>  is built substantially identically to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">spring  32</span> , except that there is an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">elongate opening  48</span>  formed in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">spring  40</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">lever member  50</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">first end  52</span>  adapted to be releasably secured to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">second handle  14</span> , and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">second end  54</span>  that includes <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">tab  30</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">Tab  30</span>  (visible in  FIGS. 4-5 ) extends from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">second end  54</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">lever member  50</span>  and is adapted to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">be inserted into opening  48</span> . In the view of  FIG. 3 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">flexible lever member  50</span>  preferably is a leaf spring having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">tab  30</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    As shown in  FIGS. 4-5 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">tab  30</span>  is received in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">opening  48</span> . In the view of  FIG. 5 , an outer portion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">tab  30</span>  is bent relative to the tab that is received in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">notch  28</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">thereby engaging spring  20</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">lever member  50</span>  via the interaction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">tab  30</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">notch  28</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    In operation, with no pressure applied to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handles  12</span> ,  14 , the nipper assumes the open position in FIG.  4 . When the handles are squeezed together (FIG.  5 ), <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">spring  40</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">lever member  50</span>  apply an outwardly biasing force on the handles, which return to the configuration of  FIG. 4  when the handles are released.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    It should be noted that, in the spring-biased nipper of  FIGS. 3-6 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">bearing surface  36</span>  does not touch the inner surface of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">handle  14</span>  throughout the entire range of travel, i.e., between a position in which the nipper jaws are fully opened, as shown in  FIG. 4 , and a position in which they are fully closed, as shown in FIG.  5 . As a result, the nipper of  FIG. 3  provides nipper operation similar to that of the prior art nipper in FIG.  1 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The present embodiment of the invention is shown in  FIG. 6  with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">lever member  50</span>  removed. Removal is accomplished by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">unscrewing screw  26</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">removing tab  30</span>  from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">opening  48</span> . In this configuration, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">bearing surface  36</span>  rides against the inner surface of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">handle  14</span> , thus providing an outwardly-biasing force to nipper handles, similar to that of the prior art nipper in FIG.  2 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Due to manufacturing and assembling efficiencies, it is more cost effective to produce and sell only the nipper of the present invention as shown in  FIGS. 3-5 , rather than separately making and selling both the nipper of FIG.  1  and the nipper of  FIG. 2 , even though there are substantial markets for both double-spring biased nippers and single-spring biased nippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    As a result of these manufacturing and assembling efficiencies, however, the nipper of  FIGS. 3-5  can be sold with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">instructions for removing screw  26</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">lever member  50</span> , thus providing the single-spring biased nipper configured as shown in FIG.  6 . On the other hand, if the customer prefers a double-spring biased nipper, it can be used as purchased (and the accompanying instructions can so state).  </p>
                    
                        <p>    In the present embodiments of the nipper, all components are preferably formed from stainless steel.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    A person skilled in the art will be able to practice the present invention in view of the description present in this document, which is to be taken as a whole. Numerous details have been set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the invention. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail in order not to obscure unnecessarily the invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    While the invention has been disclosed in its preferred form, the specific embodiments thereof as disclosed and illustrated herein are not to be considered in a limiting sense.
