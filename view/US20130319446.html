                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> An ingrown toenail cutter ( 10, 10 A) including a handle or shank ( 12, 12 A) which at one end has a curved or angled part ( 14, 52 ) which extends away from the handle ( 12, 12 A) and said curved or angled part ( 14, 52 ) has a cutting edge ( 15, 54 ) on an inner side thereof ( 14 A) and there is also provided a terminal abutment ( 17, 56 ) at a free end of the curved or angled part ( 14, 52 ) on the inner side ( 14 A) adjacent to cutting edge ( 15, 54 ) wherein the cutting edge ( 15,54 ) is oriented at an angle of  15° - 60°  to a longitudinal axis of the handle or shank. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    This invention relates to an ingrown toenail cutter and has particular application to ingrown and incurved toenails. However the invention may also be used for cutting toenails which are not incurved or ingrown.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    Onychocryptosis (also known as in “ingrown toenail”) is a common nail ailment and is a very painful condition in which the nail grows so that it cuts into one or both sides of the nail bed which is a layer of tissue under the nail or nail plate which comprises dermis and epidermis. This condition may commonly occur in toenails but can also occur in nails of the hand or other foot nails other than toenails. Hence the term “toenails” as used herein also includes within its scope other nails as described above.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    Conventional methods of treatment of ingrown toenails include removal of the portion of the toenail growing under the skin (i.e. “the ingrown toenail”) to be removed by a podiatrist after administration of a local anesthetic. Once the toe is numb the podiatrist will be able to remove the ingrown toenail and the nail matrix or nail root can be either destroyed with phenol or excusing the nail matrix. After either procedure the nail had to be dressed with antibiotic cream and bandages. It was to be appreciated that this was a very time consuming and painful procedure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    Surgical techniques for removal of ingrown toenails involved use of a digital block to anaesthetise the nail and use of a tourniquet. Then an incision is made from the base of the nail leaving the nail bed intact and the incision is continued toward the side of the toe in an elliptical sweep to end up under the tip of the nail about 3-4 mm in from the edge. In this procedure it was important that all the skin at the edge of the nail had to be removed. Again this was a time consuming procedure and the toe had to be soaked in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> warm water 3</span> times a day until healing occurred in 4-6 weeks.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    Reference also may be made to WO 2009/156788 which describes a toe restraining implement having a toe restraining hook at each end which refers to a curved end having a pointed end which was used for restraining a toe and keeping it stable while performing a treatment on the nail such as filing. However this implement could not be used for treatment of ingrown toenails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    U.S. Pat. No. 4,936,322 referred to the use of an ingrown toenail part remover which was a hollow cylindrical rod having a tapered end which was shaped to include a soft tissue depressor and a safety knife surface having a cutting edge located within the rod so that it cuts portions of the ingrown toenail as the rod is pulled away. This was a complicated device to manufacture and its use in effective treatment of ingrown toenails was questionable.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    Reference also may be made to U.S. Pat. No. 1,219,626 which referred to a manicuring device having a shank which also includes a bent portion at one end which is provided with a slot which is provided with a cutting edge on a lower part of the slot in use. A fingernail to be trimmed is placed within the slot so as to be trimmed by the cutting edge. This device could not be used for removal of ingrown toenails as it could only be applied to trimming uninfected or normal nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        OBJECT OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0008]    It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an ingrown toenail cutter which is effective in use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0009]    The ingrown toenail cutter of the invention includes a handle or shank which at one end has a curved part or angled part which extends away from the handle or shank and said curved or angled part has a cutting edge on an inner side thereof and there is also provided a terminal abutment at a free end of the curved or angled part on the inner side adjacent the cutting edge wherein the cutting edge is oriented at an acute angle of 15°-60° to a longitudinal axis of the handle or shank.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    The handle or shank in one form of the invention may be integral with the curved or angled part so that the cutter is formed in one piece. In another arrangement there may be provided a cutting component which includes the shank and the curved or angled part which is releasably attached to a handle part. The handle part in a desirable form of the invention may correspond or resemble a scalpel handle of conventional type. Thus in this arrangement the scalpel handle may be releasably attached to the cutting component in a similar manner as a scalpel blade is releasably attached to a scalpel blade. Thus more specifically the scalpel handle may include an elongate end extension which may releasably engage in a retention slot in a shank of the cutting component. In this embodiment the end extension may have opposed slots which engage with corresponding edges of the retention slot.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    However the cutting component may be releasably attached to the handle part by any other form of reliable engagement such as by use of a grub screw or other fastener interconnecting aligned apertures in both the handle component and the shank of the cutting component.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    In relation to the acute angle between the cutting edge and the handle or shank this<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> may more preferably be between 25</span>°-40° and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> most p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">referably be 30</span>° or 35</span>° or therebetween.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]    In one form of the invention the shank of the cutting component is relatively straight and the curved part forms an end extension of the shank whereby the cutting edge may form the acute angle with the longitudinal axis of the shank as described above. Welded or attached to the curved part of the shank may be a web plate which interconnects an adjacent end of the shank and the terminal abutment. A free edge of the web plate may form the cutting edge.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0014]    In another form of the invention the cutting component has the shank in the form of an elongate plate and the angled part is an end extension of the elongate plate whereby the cutting edge forms the acute angle as described above. On the inner side of the end extension is the cutting edge and there is also provided an outer edge in opposed relationship to the inner edge.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0015]    It will be appreciated that the term “inner” having regard to the curved or angled part of the ingrown toenail cutter of the invention means that the inner side is located or defined by possessing the cutting edge and the terminal abutment. In relation to the term “outer” this means an edge or side of the angled or curved part which is substantially in opposed relationship with the inner side or edge.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0016]    In another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of use of the ingrown toenail cutter of the invention which includes the following steps of: </p>
                    
                        <p>        (i) compressing soft flesh of a toe adjacent an ingrown toenail with an outer side of the curved or angled part;   (ii) placing the curved or angled part underneath the ingrown toenail wherein the terminal abutment engages an outer surface of the ingrown toenail; and   (iii) cutting the ingrown toenail away from an adjacent toenail by using the cutting edge in a reciprocatory or sawing motion while at the same time pulling the curved or angled part away from the ingrown toenail to separate the ingrown toenail from the toenail.        </p>
                    
                        <p>   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]    In yet another aspect of the invention there is provided the cutting component per se.  </p>
                    
                        <p>       </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>

                        <p>          [0044]    It will also be appreciated that both a left handed version as well as a right handed version of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">cutter <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> 10</span>  or  10</span> A be provided so that whether a left hand side or right hand side of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">toenail  43</span>  requires removal of an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">ingrown toenail  41</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0045]    This is shown in  FIGS. 16-17  wherein  FIG. 16  illustrates a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">cutting component  11</span> A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">wherein cutting edge  15</span>  extends at angle α to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">longitudinal axis  9</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">shank  19</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">cutting component  11</span> A and wherein angled part  14  extends to the right of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">longitudinal axis  9</span>  and in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">cutting component<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">  11</span>  B wherein angled component  14</span>  extends to the left of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">longitudinal axis  9</span>  at angle α to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">longitudinal axis  9</span> . In<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> either<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> case angle α can be 30</span>° or 35</span>° or any value between these angles. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">right hand component  11</span> A can be used for cutting left hand corners of the user&#39;s toenails and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">left hand component  11</span> B would be suitable for cutting a left hand corner of the user&#39;s toenails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0046]    It will be appreciated from the foregoing that the ingrown toenail cutter of the invention is of extremely simple construction and very effective in use. The use of a conventional scalpel handle is also extremely advantageous and avoids manufacture of an integral handle. The ingrown toenail cutter of the invention is also very simple to use in practice as shown in  FIGS. 8-13  wherein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">outer side  16</span>  is pressed against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">soft fle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">sh  40</span>  adjacent ingrown toenail  41</span>  to allow the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">cutting edge  15</span>  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">be inserted under ingrown toenail  41</span>  and levered into desir<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">ed position for cutting ingrown toenail  41</span>  with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">project<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">ion  17</span>  permitting cutting edge  15</span>  to b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">e safely inserted under ingrown toenail  41</span>  and located in an appropriate position as shown in  FIG. 11  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">enable cutting edge  15</span>  to be drawn back and forth or in a sawing or reciprocatory fashion to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">cut ingrown toenail  41</span>  as shown in  FIGS. 12-13 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0047]    From the above, it will further be appreciated that the feature of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">projection  17</span>  is important because it makes the ingrown toenail cutter of the invention extremely safe to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">use <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">because projection  17</span>  or boss  56</span>  will ensure that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">cutting edge  15</span>  will not cut or remove tissue if the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">ingrown<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> toenail cutter  10</span>  or  10</span> A is used in the manner described above. This also means that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">ingrown toenail cutter  10</span>  can be used by any member of the public or unskilled person without the requirement of a podiatrist. This is achieved by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">project<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">ion  17</span>  or boss  56</span>  ensuring that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">cutting edge  15</span>  to b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">e safely inserted under ingrown toenail  41</span>  and located in desired position as described above.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0048]    It is emphasized that prior to use the ingrown toenail cutter of the invention should be immersed in a solution of warm water which optionally can contain wetting agents and/or disinfectants. </p>
