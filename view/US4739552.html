                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A pliers for cuticles includes a pair of gripping arms having cutting blades, and an opening leaf spring positioned between the gripping arms and carrying at one end thereof plastic sliding element sliding against the inner surface of one of the gripping arms and anchored in an opening formed in the end portion of the leaf spring. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates to pliers, particularly to pliers for removing cuticles.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Pliers of the type under consideration have been known, which cuticle pliers included a sliding element made of hardenable plastic by an immersion method. The fixing of such a sliding element has been insufficient in view of usual sterilization problems. Finally, one had to compromise in regard to the rigidity of the utilized synthetic plastic material and the sterilization capacity.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved cuticle pliers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is a further object of the present invention to provide a plier in which a leaf spring would be provided with a sliding element which would be manufactured by injection molding and would meet hygienic requirements.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      These and other objects of the invention are attained by a pliers, particularly for cuticles, comprising two pivotable gripping arms; and an opening leaf spring positioned between said arms, said leaf spring being resistant to bending and having one end portion snugly lying against an inner surface of one of said arms and another end portion carrying a plastic sliding element sliding against an inner surface of another of said arms, said spring having at least one opening in which said element is anchored.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The sliding element may be a rivet inserted in said opening and having a rivet head projecting outwardly from said spring and having a sliding surface.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The rivet may be formed as a round head rivet.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The diameter of said rivet head may substantially correspond to a width of an end of said another end portion of said spring, said rivet head being completed with a ball-shaped portion to form a pearl-shaped sliding element in a diametrical plane of which said another end portion of said spring extends.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The spring may be pivotally connected to said one arm and is pivotable about an axis perpendicular to said inner surface of said one arm, said ball-shaped portion having an attack surface spaced from said inner surface of said one arm, a free end of said spring being offset relative to said attack surface.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Notches may be formed in side flanks of said spring, said notches constituting openings in which said element is anchored.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The pliers according to the invention is easy to manufacture and it meets sterilization requirements. The engagement of sliding element in the opening or notches of the leaf spring provides a reliable anchoring. The extension of the opening is optimal. For example, pockets of hardenable plastic or walls of a shoe-like sliding element can be made by injection molding of one or more material webs. On the other hand, the structure of the sliding element as a rivet is advantageous. Such sliding element can be produced in customary devices by thermal immersion methods. If the sliding element is a rivet its shaft extends in the opening of the leaf spring transversely thereof. The rivet can have a head with a sliding surface. The round-shaped rivet head provides a good sliding motion of the sliding element along the inner surface of the gripping arm. The ball-shaped sliding surface provides a friction source that increases the service life of the pliers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The pearl-shaped sliding element permits to avoid the danger of displacement in the region of the narrow end of the leaf spring. The ball-shaped portion of the sliding element provides a very stable structure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The novel features which are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in particular in the appended claims. The invention itself, however, both as to its construction and its method of operation, together with additional objects and advantages thereof, will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A pliers, particularly for removing cuticles, is comprised of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> grippi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ng arms 1 and 2</span></span> which cross each other in the region of operating. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> connec<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ting pin which connects arms 1 and 2</span></span> to each other is designated by reference numeral 3.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> Arms 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> and 2</span></span> are terminated with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> plier jaw 4</span> which is formed by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> two cu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">tting blades 5 and 6</span></span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      When<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> grippe<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">r arms 1 and 2</span></span> are expanded the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> jaw 4</span> is held in the open position so that the manipulating of the plier is limited to the pressing of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> grippi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ng arms 1 and 2</span></span> against each other. An easy operation of the pliers is obtained by an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> opening leaf spring 7</span>. The latter lies snugly on an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> inner side 1</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> gripping arm 1</span>. This spring has<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> one end 7</span>&#39; which corresponds to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> gripping arm 1</span> and is resistant to bending. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> other end 7</span>&#34; is spaced from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> inner side 1</span>&#39; of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> arm 1</span> and extends substantially within the region of operating of the plier, in the direction towards the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> other gripping arm 2</span> where it is in contact with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> inner surface 8</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> arm 2</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> other end 7</span>&#34; defines the expansion position of the pliers which position can be exceeded by a further expansion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> grippi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ng arms 1 and 2</span></span>, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">for exa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">mple for sharpening cutting blades 5, 6</span></span>. This movement is obtained however with a certain resistance by a respective friction-dependent insertion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> connecting pin 3</span>. On the other hand, the operation surfaces can be easily raised in this direction.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">  </p>
                    
                        <p>      End 7</span>&#34; of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> opening leaf 7</span> is reinforced with a sliding element G made of synthetic plastic material. This sliding element is anchored in an opening or openings of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> leaf spring 7</span> and slides over the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> above mentioned inner surface 8</span>, upon the operation of the pliers in the direction of closing of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> jaw 4</span>, also for example during the cutting movement.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The plastic sliding element G is formed in the embodiment of FIGS. 1 to 3 as a rivet. For the insertion of this rivet the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> free end 7</span>&#34; of the opening leaf spring has a through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> opening 9</span>. This opening receives a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> shaft 10</span> of the rivet. This opening can be drilled or made by stamping. The front edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> end 7</span>&#34; extends concentrically to the wall of that opening. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> sliding surface 11</span>, which slides on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> inner surface 8</span>, is formed as a round head as clearly shown in FIG. 2. The fixing of the rivet takes place in the path of the deforming of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> shaft 10</span>. By selection of a respective material a thermal deformation is taken into consideration.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In order to prevent direct contact between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> leaf spring 7</span> made of steel, that is its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> end 7</span>&#34; and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> inner surface 8</span> of the pliers arm, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> rivet head 11</span> has the diameter which substantially corresponds to the width X of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> end 7</span>&#34; of the opening leaf spring. This width may be somewhat below the diameter of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> rivet head 11</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> ball 12</span> provided at the back side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> rivet head 11</span> and extended towards the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> gripping arm 1</span> adds to the shape of the rivet head so that as a whole it has the shape of a pearl whereby the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> opening leaf spring 7</span> extends substantially in the diametral plane of this rivet head.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In the opening initial position of the pliers shown in FIG. 1, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> free end 7</span>&#34; of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> opening leaf spring 7</span> includes an acute angle Î± with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> inner surface 8</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> gripping arm 2</span>. Upon the closing movement of the pliers, this acute angle is reduced until the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> inner surface 8</span> comes to the position parallel to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> free end 7</span>&#34;.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> leaf spring 7</span> has in the direction of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> pin 3</span> such a length that in the closed position of the pliers, the sliding element G remains at the sufficient distance from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> surface 3</span>&#39; of the operation region of the plier so that no mechanical loading can exert on the plastic sliding element. The latter is positioned in the wedge-shaped zone.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> opening leaf spring 7</span> can be pivoted about the axis formed by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> bolt 13</span> from the plane of movement of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> grippi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ng arms 1 and 2</span></span> and brought, for example to the position in which the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> free end 7</span>&#34; of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> opening leaf spring 7</span> lies before a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> concave portion 14</span>&#39; of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> inner surface 14</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> gripping arm 1</span>. This position is selected when a respective force storage must not be utilized. The through opening in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> spring 7</span> for the shaft of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> bolt 13</span> is designated at 16.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The force-storing practical position of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> opening leaf spring 1</span>, as shown in FIG. 1 is a stopping position. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> end 7</span>&#39; of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> leaf spring 7</span> has for this purpose a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> locking or stop projection 15</span> which cooperates with a locking recess provided in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> inner surface 14</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> gripping arm 1</span>. Due to the S-shaped bent structure the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> end 7</span>&#34; of the spring is under a spring loading in the locking engagement direction.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Because the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> opening leaf spring 7</span> is pivotally connected on the axis extending perpendicular to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> inner surface 14</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> gripping arm 1</span>, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> ball 12</span>, in the reverse position of the leaf spring, projects outwardly to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> inner surface 14</span>, the attack surface is formed, relative to which the free front edge of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> spring 7</span> is offset rearwardly. So, upon the pivoting of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> leaf spring 7</span> a hinge movement results so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> gripping arm 1</span> is not scratched. The rivet-carrying end deflects in a slightly resilient fashion.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Polypropylene regenerate, known in practice as Hostalene, can be utilized for producing the sliding element G.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The opening leaf spring shown in FIG. 5 corresponds in shape to the spring of FIG. 4. In place of the rivet in the embodiment of FIG.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> 5 opening 9</span> receives a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> web 10</span>&#39; corresponding to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> shaft 10</span> and formed by material filling of the sliding element G produced by injection molding or immersion. In this manner a shoe is formed, which extends further in the direction of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> opening 16</span>, as for example the material of the rivet of FIG. 2. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> web 10</span>&#39; merges into a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> wider wall portion 17</span> of the shoe. The region extending before the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> end 7</span>&#34; of the leaf spring is thereby fully coated. The front end of the sliding element is rounded in both transversal directions.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A further modification of the leaf spring illustrated in FIGS. 7 and 8 differs from the above described embodiments in that the openings causing the anchoring of the plastic sliding element G are formed as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> notches 18</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> narrow side flanks 7</span>&#39;&#34; of the opening leaf spring. In this modification,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> each side flank 7</span>&#39;&#34; of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> end 7</span>&#34; of the spring is provided with such a notch. These notches can be offset relative to each other in the direction of elongation. The notch peak reaches approximately up to the axis of symmetry of the leaf spring. The respective offsetting leads to an S-shaped structure. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> end 7</span>&#34; can be also formed by injection molding, or immersion, or deforming or by extending of a portion from a shrinkable material.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It will be understood that each of the elements described above, or two or more together, may also find a useful application in other types of pliers differing from the types described above.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      While the invention has been illustrated and described as embodied in pliers for removing cuticles, it is not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the gist of the present invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily adapt it for various applications without omitting features that, from the standpoint of prior art, fairly constitute essential characteristics of the generic or specific aspects of this invention. </p>
