                        <p>   In the modification illustrated in Fig. 5 I have shown the handle Z and the file j secured to the lever a by means of a single pivot pin Z, and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> I loca<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">te apertures 2 and 3</span></span> on each side of said pivot pin Z in the lever a as shown. In the ile j and handle Z, I locate the slight protuberances, 5 and 4, respectively in such a position as to snap into one or the other of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> apertu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">res 2, 3</span></span>, when either or both the handle or file are turned upon the pivot pin Z. These<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> protub<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">erances 4 and 5</span></span> are produced by indenting the face of the part so as to force the metal into a slight projectionupon its opposite side as shown.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   From the above description it will be noted that when the handle Z .is swung into the position shown in Figs. l and 3, the spring will open the levers and cutters while the handle Z will sufficiently lengthen thelever a to give the user a hold thereon so that he may easily manipulate the lever b to operate the device. The location of the cutters in a diagonal line along the edges of the levers also adds to the convenience of the device in use.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In Fig. 6, I have shown a still further slight modification in which both the handle Z and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> file 7</span>&#39; are pivoted to the lever a by the single pivot pin Z. In this case I provide the handle with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> small rivet 6</span> convexly headed on both sides as shown. In the handle Z I locate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> aperture 7</span> and .in the le j the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> two apertures 8</span> so placed as to register with the heads of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> rivet 6</span> as clearly illustrated. The tongues on the washer v are received into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> aperture 8</span> as described in connection with Fig. 4.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In each of the constructions illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6, the handle a should be slightly longer than the handle Z) so that the rectangular keeper I will properly register with the notch in the said handle ZJ.   </p>
