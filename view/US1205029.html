                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> TE @TA s ra ns aro.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern Be it known that I, EMMA FARRELL RUG- ones, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of the city of&#39;New York, borough of Brooklyn, in the county of Kings and State of New York, have invented a new and Improved Toilet-Scissors, ofwhich the following is a full, clear, and&#39;exact&#39; description.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My invention relates to a toilet scissors &#39;and has for its prime object to give a blade of, the scissors at the front end a form whereby a depressed nail, particularly a depressed toe nail, may be effectively raised with facility and despatch and without any danger of cutting either the nail&#39;of the toe or finger.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The stated object of the invention is attained by forming the blade with a depressed upper side presenting a top surface rounding transversely from the back edge of the blade toward the opposite side edge which latter constitutes the usual cutting edge of the blade and the said rounding surfaceadjacent to the back or rear side of the blade presenting a gradual rise or upward incline, toward the rear end of the blade. At the said cutting edge there is the usual bevel at an angle to the lower fiat side of the blade so thatthe rounding lines are attained without interfering with the cutting function of the blade. Also, the lines of the rounding depressed portion merge into the front end of the blade, said front of the blade&#34; being transversely rounded. Furthermore,the said rear edge of the blade at the depressed portion is in the form of a dull, non-cutting edge. The result of this novel formation of the front end of the blade and the surfaces adjacent thereto, is that the blade may be&#39;readily entered beneath a depressed or ingrowing nail and by a transverse rocking movement of the blade, the nail may be quickly lifted without injury to the toe or finger and the blade at the same time worked forwardly while beneath the nail so that the trans versely rounding lines,;coupled with the rear incline, enable the user to quickly restore the nail to normal condition. Incidentally, the transversely rounded front end serves for forcing back the cuticle of the nail in a proper manner and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> front cutting edge 7</span> of the blade is available as usual for trimming the said cuticle after it has been manipulated by the front end of the blade.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My improved scissors, in its preferred form, includes also, a nail file on the shank ofone of the blades, the file being dovetailed into the shank to be firmly held in Specification of Letters Eatent. Patented N5 14 ,191   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Application filed December 18; 1915. Serial No. 67,555.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">   </p>

                        <p>   Figure 1 is a plan view&#39;of a toilet scissors embodying my invention, the size being exaggerated beyond the actual size of scissors; Fig. 2 is a back edge view thereof; Fig. 3 is a transverse sectionon the line 3-3, Fig.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  &#39;2, on a scale much enlarged to better illustrate the distinctive formation at the front of the scissors, Fig. A is a fragmentary longitudinal section on the line 4-4, F ig. 1&#39;, the view being on the same scale as Fig. 3&#39;; and Fig. 5 is a perspective-view of the forward end ofone of the blades enlarged to the&#39;scale of Figs. 3 and 4:. Y   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In constructing a practical embodiment of my invention in its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> prefer<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">red form scissors blades 10 and 11</span></span> are given in general, the conventional form having<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> finger-holds 12</span> at the rear ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> shanks 13</span>, the   </p>
                    
                        <p>  bladesbeing pivotally connected by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> screw 14</span> in the usual manner.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> ni&#39<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">;inierals 15, 16</span></span> (Fig.3) designate the cuttingedges of the respective blades, the numeral 17 indicating the usual bevel of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> bladev 10</span> to produce, with the flat side of the blade, the cutting edge of the latter as usual.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   At the forward end the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> blade 10</span> is depressed as at 18, the depression extending from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> front end 19</span> of the blade rearwardly. The surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> depressed portion 18</span> presents lines rounding transversely from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> back edge 20</span> of the blade toward the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> cutting edge 15</span>. The transversely rounding lines of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> depressed portion 18</span> may be continued from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> back edge 20</span> to a juncture with&#39; the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> bevel 17</span> of the cutting edge, but, in any event, the said surface will be rounded transversely adjacent to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> back edge 20</span>. of the blade, the purpose of which will clearly appear as the description proceeds. At the rear end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> depression 18</span>, there is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> rise or incline 21</span>, the transr&#39;ersely rounding surface lines being continued at said incline. The juncture of the transversely rounding lines with the fiat lower side of the blade at the back is such as to produce a dull, non-cutting back edge at the depressed portion and such dull edge and the lines of the depressed portion merge forwardly into the lines of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> front end 19</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> said end 19</span> being transversely rounded.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   With the described form of the blade, the same is manipulated asfollows in raising a depressed nail: The blade is entered beneath the nail either at the center or adjacent to the depressed corner of the nail,the blade being preferably entered endwise. The rounded depressed portion at the back of the blade having been brought beneath the nail, the blade is rocked transversely andat the sametime advanced beneath the depressed side portion of the nail. The rockingof the blade and the gradual forward movement thereof eventually brings the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> upwardly inclined rounding portion 21</span> beneath the depressed part ofthe nail so that the latter is quickly restored to&#39; its normalcondition or, in any event, to a raised conditionsufficient for the proper trimming of the nail. In any case, a few applications of the blade to the nail will eventually restore it to its proper condition. The manipulation of the blade in thus restoring the nail involves no possible danger of cutting the toe or finger by reason of the dull edges at the back and front. Incidentally, the described formation of the blade for treating a depressed or ingrowing nail, results in a proper form of the front end of the blade for forcing back the cuticle about the nail. Also, since the rounding lines in no way in terfere with thefront cutting edge of the blade, or its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> bevel 17</span>, said front edge at the depressed portion may be conveniently utilized for trimming the cuticle after the same has been manipulated by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> rounded end 19</span>. One of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> shanks 13</span> of the scissors is, in   </p>
                    
                        <p>  blades formed with a broadened end porb tion, the end of which is curved radially outwardly and downwardly from a common point and terminates in a transversely curved under edge, the remaining portion of said broadened end portion being transversely curved outwardly and downwardly and terminates in a substantially straight under side forming a cutting edge, the front portion of the remaining portion merging with the curved end portion and receding rearwardly therefrom and having its rear portion inclined gradually upwardly and merging with the adjacent body portion of said blade to provide a wedge shaped side edge at the rear of said under side edge,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  whereby to provide means at the end of said blade for manicuring the cuticle around a nail and means at the side of said blade to cooperate with the end means for elevating a nail when positioned therebeneath and moved longitudinally thereunder.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In testimony whereof I have signed my name to this specification in the presence of two subscribing Witnesses.   </p>
