                        <p> CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]     This application claims priority to copending U.S. provisional application entitled, “Enhanced Nail Clippers,” having Ser. No. 60/644,674 filed Jan. 18, 2005, which is entirely incorporated herein by reference.  </p>
                    
                        <p>       </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIELD OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]     The present invention generally relates to nail clippers. More specifically, the invention relates to nail clippers for animals, such as dogs and cats.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0003]     Some animals, such as dogs, have veins present in the center and toward the base of their nails. If an owner or groomer accidentally cuts the quick of the nail (the vein), not only does it cause the animal pain, but the wound bleeds profusely. For animals with light colored nails, the quick can often be seen with the naked eye. For animals with dark colored nails it is very difficult to see where the quick ends. It is important to cut an animal&#39;s nail as close to the quick as possible because the quick will grow over time if the nails are not cut back filly. To shorten the quick the animal must be anesthetized and all the nails cut to the base and through the quick.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]     Nail clippers are available today that use an adjustable stop that limit the amount of nail that is cut off. This prevents the user from cutting the quick only if they know exactly how much to cut off. If the guard is set to a length that is safe on one nail it may not be safe on another nail. Animals&#39; nails grow and wear differently even on the same foot/paw.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]     Another type of clipper that attempts to deal with this issue clips the nail based on diameter. That method assumes that the quick ends where the nail is at a specific diameter. Although this may help keep the user from cutting the nails too short, it does not identify the location of the quick and, thus, the possibility of either cutting the quick or leaving the nails too long remains.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]     U.S. Pat. No. 6,220,251 to Jeong et al. (hereinafter “Jeong”), entitled Combination Vision Enhancement Kit and Nail Clipper, illustrates a conventional nail clipper with accompanying lens to magnify the respective cutting area. Furthermore, the Jeong patent teaches a light source that could further be used to enhance the field of view (See Col. 2, lines 45-53) by illuminating the general viewing area. The Jeong patent is generally focused on nail clippers to be used for human nails, and so fails to recognize the need to clip animal nails as close to the quick as possible.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]     As such, there remains an unsatisfied need in the market for nail clippers that better provide for clipping animals&#39; nails, given the unique features of such nails as just previously mentioned.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0008]     Various embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in the present disclosure. A first embodiment of the present invention is a system for enhancing the clipping of a nail. The system comprises a lighting element for transilluminating the nail, a power supply for powering the lighting element, and a switch for activating the lighting element.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]     A second embodiment is a nail clipper that includes a lighting element coupled to a first reciprocating blade. The lighting element is positioned to transilluminate a patient&#39;s nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]     A third embodiment is a system for enhancing the clipping of a patient&#39;s nail. The system comprises means for transilluminating the patient&#39;s nail such that the quick of the nail becomes better visible.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]     A fourth embodiment is a method for better manicuring an animal&#39;s nail. The method includes: aligning a lighting element to a target nail such that the target nail is transilluminated to visually expose the location of the animal&#39;s quick; positioning a cutting instrument to a desirable location, relative to the quick, of the target nail; and cutting the target nail with the cutting instrument.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0022]     Referring now in more detail to the drawings, in which like numerals indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views,  FIG. 1  illustrates a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">conventional nail clipper  1</span>  used to cut an animal&#39;s nails. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail clipper  1</span>  is generally comprised of a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">cutting blades  2</span>  and  3 , each with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cutting edge  4</span>  and  5 , positioned reciprocate of each other. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">handle  8</span>  is coupled to the pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">cutting blades  2</span>  and  3 . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">bolt  6</span>  is used to couple the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">blades  2</span>  and  3  and to pivot in a first plane. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">biasing spring  7</span>  can also be included to bias the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">handles  8</span>  in an open position. In some cases, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">biasing spring  7</span>  may be excluded.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]     Typically, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">cutting blades  2</span>  and  3  are composed of hardened metal, sharpened at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">edges  2</span>  and  3 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">handle  8</span>  can be composed of a hardened plastic, rubber, metal, or wood.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]     In practice, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail clippers  1</span>  function very similar to a pair of scissors. A user places the target nail between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cutting edges  4</span>  and  5 , grips the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">handle  8</span> , and squeezes to cause the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cutting edges  4</span>  and  5  to come together and clip the target nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]      FIG. 2A  is an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">illustration  10</span>  of an animal&#39;s nail when not illuminated by a device embodying the present invention. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">nail  13</span>  protrudes from a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">toe  12</span> . Often, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">nail  13</span>  will curve as it grows out from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">toe  12</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">pad  14</span>  is often found on the bottom of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">toe  12</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]      FIG. 2B  is an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">illustration  20</span>  of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">pet&#39;s nail  23</span>  when transilluminated by a device embodying the present invention. Similar to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">nail  13</span>  of  FIG. 2A , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">nail  23</span>  grows from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">toe  22</span> , and tends to curve downward as it grows. When transilluminated by a light source, that is when illuminated to reveal the interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">nail  13</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">quick  26</span>  becomes viewable. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">target cutting area  27</span>  is beyond the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">quick  26</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]      FIG. 3  is a perspective view illustrating an embodiment of an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">enhanced nail clipper system  100</span>  in accordance with the present invention. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">Enhanced nail clipper system  100</span>  is illustrated as mounted or affixed to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">conventional nail clipper  101</span> . In this case, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">system  100</span>  may be an aftermarket product and retrofitted to one of a number of nail clipper models.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]     The first embodiment of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">enhanced nail clipper system  100</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lighting element  115</span>  confined within a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lighting housing  110</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lighting housing  110</span> , in this embodiment is mounted atop a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">first blade member  102</span>  and positioned in such a way as to transilluminate a target nail when placed between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">cutting edges  104</span>  and  105  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">nail clipper  101</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0029]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lighting element  115</span>  is powered by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">wire lead  120</span>  running from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lighting housing  110</span>  to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130">toggle switch  130</span> .

The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130">toggle switch  130</span>  is wired to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">power supply  140</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0030]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lighting element  115</span>  could utilize a number of illumination technologies. Light emitting diodes (LEDs), incandescent, and laser are all types of lighting elements that could be used to transilluminate the target nail. It should be construed by those having ordinary skill in the art that any of these lighting technologies mentioned and those not mentioned could be utilized and should be broadly captured as a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lighting element  115</span> . All such embodiments should be included within the scope of the present invention without departing from the spirit of the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0031]     The particular footprint of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lighting housing  110</span>  is beyond the scope of the present invention. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">housing  110</span>  can be mounted or affixed to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">cutting blade  102</span>  in a number of ways including by adhesive, such as glue or epoxy, or magnetically. The manner and approach in which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">housing  110</span>  is affixed to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">cutting blade  102</span>  is generally beyond the scope of the present invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0032]     There are a number of on/off type switches known in the art that could be used as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130">aforementioned toggle switch  130</span> . Some examples of switches include: push button on/off switches, dip switches, compression switches, motion-sensitive switches, membrane switches, capacitive switches, and rotary switches. It should be construed by those having ordinary skill in the art that any of these switching technologies mentioned and those not mentioned could be utilized and have been broadly defined as a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130">toggle switch  130</span> . All such embodiments should be included within the scope of the present invention. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0033]     Power supply  140</span>  could be any of a number of power supplies, such as a potential energy source (battery) or kinetic energy converter. The particular power generation technology is beyond the scope of the present invention. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">power supply  140</span> , although illustrated as being integrated with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">handle  108</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">nail clippers  101</span> , could be positioned in a number of ways. For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">power supply  140</span>  (and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130">switch  130</span> ) could be integrated in with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lighting housing  110</span>  to comprise one single element. The particular positioning and the particular type of power supply are beyond the scope of this embodiment of the present invention   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0034]     In practice, a user turns on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">system  100</span> , by toggling the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130">switch  130</span>  to an on position. A target nail is positioned between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">cutting edges  104</span>  and  105  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">clippers  101</span>  such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lighting element  115</span>  transilluminates the matter comprising the target nail. Upon locating the quick, the user can align the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">cutting edges  104</span>  and  105  accordingly, and make an accurate cut.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0035]      FIG. 4A  is a perspective view illustrating a first embodiment of an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">enhanced nail clipper  200</span>  in accordance with the present invention.

In this embodiment, the lighting housing is mounted to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">cutting blade  202</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">clipper  200</span> . In alternative embodiments, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem215">lighting element  215</span>  may be housed elsewhere, such as in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">handle  208</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">clippers  200</span> , and a fiber optic cable and/or some other lighting conduit, such as a lightpipe, could be used to direct light to the appropriate position relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204">cutting edges  204</span>  and  205 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem215">lighting element  215</span>  could also be placed on the outside edge of the cutting element so that it shines on both sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">blade  202</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0036]      FIG. 4B  is a perspective view illustrating a second embodiment of an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">enhanced nail clipper  250</span>  in accordance with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">present invention Nail clipper  250</span>  is based upon a second type of animal nail clipper prevalent in the market today. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">Nail clipper  250</span> , is comprised of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">first handle  258</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem259">second handle  259</span>  that are movable with respect to each other in a first plane of motion in order to provide relative movement between a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem252">first cutting blade  252</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem253">stationary anvil  253</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem252">Cutting blade  252</span>  moves with respect to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem253">anvil  253</span>  in a second plane of motion, which in this embodiment, is substantially perpendicular to the first plane of motion.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem253">[0037]     Stationary anvil  253</span>  is molded such that a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem251">hole exists  251</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem251">hole  251</span>  is positioned to receive a target nail, whereby the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem252">first cutting blade  252</span>  will sweep across and cut the target nail when the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">second handles  258</span>  and  259  are squeezed together. A biasing spring (not shown) may be positioned between the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">second handles  258</span>  and  259  to bias the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">clipper  250</span>  in an open position. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0038]     Nail clipper  250</span>  further includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem265">lighting element  265</span>  positioned relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem251">hole  251</span>  so as to transilluminate the medium of the target nail. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem265">Lighting element  265</span>  is placed within a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem260">lighting housing  260</span>  which is affixed and/or integrated with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem253">stationary anvil  253</span> .

                        <p>          [0039]      FIG. 5  is a perspective view illustrating a third embodiment of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">enhanced nail clipper  300</span>  in accordance with the present invention. Again, a conventional nail clipper is the basis of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">enhanced nail clipper  300</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">Nail clipper  300</span>  includes <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem308">handles  308</span>  coupled with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">opposing cutting blades  302</span>  and  303 , each with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">cutting edges  304</span>  and  305 . When the handles are squeezed together, the cutting edges,  304  and  305 , close against each other in a first plane, thus cutting a target nail. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem307">biasing spring  307</span>  can be used to bias the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem308">handles  308</span>  in an open position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">[0040]     Enhanced nail clipper  300</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">lightpipe  310</span>  positioned to transilluminate a target nail to be positioned by the user between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">cutting edges  304</span>  and  305 . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">fiber optic cable  320</span> , or some other means, is used to direct light from a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem350">lighting element  350</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">lightpipe  310</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem350">lighting element  350</span> , in this embodiment, is embedded in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem309">cavity  309</span>  of one of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem308">handles  308</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0041]     Coupled to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem350">lighting element  350</span>  is a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem330">push-button switch  330</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem340">power source  340</span>  is also housed within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem309">cavity  309</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem345">Certain electronic components  345</span> , such as diodes or resistors can also be found in the cavity. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem330">push-button switch  330</span>  can protrude from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem308">handle  308</span> , such that the user can turn on and off the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem350">lighting element  350</span>  when desired. Again a number of switching technologies could be used without departing from the spirit of the present invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0042]      FIG. 6  is a perspective view illustrating a fourth embodiment of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">enhanced nail clipper  400</span>  in accordance with the present invention. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">Enhanced nail clipper  400</span>  is similar to that of  FIG. 4A , wherein a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem415">lighting element  415</span>  is positioned relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem404">cutting edges  404</span>  and  405  to transilluminate a target nail. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem410">Lighting housing  410</span>  is mounted or integrated with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem402">cutting blade  402</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem409">cavity  409</span>  in one of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem408">handles  408</span>  houses a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem440">power source  440</span>  and possi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem445">bly some discrete electronic components  445</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">Enhanced nail clipper  400</span>  further includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem430">compression switch  430</span>  to control power being delivered to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem415">lighting element  415</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0043]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem430">compression switch  430</span>  is comprised of first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem431">second contact points  431</span>  and  432 , mounted reciprocal each other on an interior portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem408">handle  408</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem433">spring  433</span>  is coupled to one of the contact points. When the handles are squeezed together, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem433">spring  433</span>  comes into contact with both contact points, thus completing a circuit and delivering power to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem415">lighting element  415</span> . Not shown is a biasing spring which may be mounted between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem408">handles  408</span>  and exclusive of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem430">compression switch  430</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0044]      FIG. 7  is a block diagram illustrating a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem500">novel method  500</span>  for grooming an animal&#39;s nails in accordance with the present invention. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem500">method  500</span>  begins by aligning a lighting element with a target nail so as to transilluminate the nail, thus exposing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem510">quick (step  510</span> ). This can be accomplished in a number of ways, such as those illustrated in previous figures. Other conceived methods of accomplishing this step are by placing a light source, not part of the nail clipper, in a position such that the target nail is transilluminated. Such a light could be a desk lamp or a light source integrated with the procedure table.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0045]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem500">method  500</span>  continues by positioning the cutting instrument along the target nail so as to cut off the desired length while not cutting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem520">quick (step  520</span> ). The quick is now viewable by way of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem510">step  510</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem530">method  530</span>  proceeds with cutting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem530">target nail  530</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0046]     It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments of the present invention, are merely possible examples of implementations, merely set forth for a clear understanding of the principles of the invention.
