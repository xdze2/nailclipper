HARVEY N. BLISS United States Patent Gfifice IMPLEMENT ASSEMBLY Windsor, Conn, assignor to The Britten Newington, Conn, a corporation of Con- The present invention relates to a combination implement assembly, and more particularly to a combination implement assembly providing a nail clipper and a plurality of :blade-like implements.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Many pocket knives provide a plurality of blade-like implements including a knife, nail file, screwdriver, a bottle opener, and like members as individual blade members or in the form of combination blade members capable of several functions. Folded sheet metal casings having widely employed here to reduce costs and ease of fabrication as a receptacle for such blade-like elements. Generally, nail clippers have been separate implements although some efforts have been made to combine knife units and nail clipper units as seen in United States Patents 1,424,651 andf2,724,179<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   I<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem424">t is an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem651"> object of the pre</span></span></span>sent invention to provide a novel combination nail clipper and blade-like implement assembly which is relatively compact, highly attractive, and relatively inexpensive to manufacture.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object is to provide such an assembly which also provides tools for use with tobacco pipes.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Still another object is to provide such an assembly which provides protection for the user from injury by the nail clipper jaws.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Other objects and advantages will be readily apparent from the following detailed specification and attached drawing wherein:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of the combination implement assembly of the present invention with various of the blade-like elements pivoted outwardly of the casing and with the operating lever and pipe reamer pivoted into operative position;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIGURE 2 is a plan view of the implement assembly of FIGURE 1 with the blade-like elements and operative lever in closed position and with the tamping member illustrated in phantom line as rotated to one side of the assembly;   </p>
                    
                        <p>  FIGURE 3 is a rear end elevational view thereof;   </p>

                        <p>  FIGURE 5 is a side elevational view thereof;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIGURE 6 is a bottom view thereof with the tamping member positioned to abut against the jaw elements and illustrated in phantom line rotated to one side of the assembly in inoperative position; and   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIGURE 7 is a side elevational view of another embodiment of this invention similar to that shown in FIGURES 1-6 except in the pivotal mounting of the reamer.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It has now been found that the foregoing and related objects and advantages may be readily attained in a combination implement assembly having a casing integrally formed of resiliently deflectable sheet material with a pair of spaced apart, generally elongated side wall portions and a base portion connecting the side wall portions from adjacent one end thereof but terminating inwardly from the other end thereof to provide unconnected lengths of the side wall. portions adjacent the other end which are resiliently deflectable relative to each other. The unconnected lengths are configured to provide cooperating nail clipper jaw elements at the free ends thereof and are biased apart in operative position to provide yieldable spacing between the clipper jaw elements. A post is provided intermediate the length of the unconnected lengths and has an elongated operating lever pivotably 3,316,634<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> Patent<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem316">ed May <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem634">2, 1967 mounted thereon which ex</span></span></span>tends generally longitudinaly of the side wall portions and is pivotable into operative position with its free end spaced above the side wall portions for biasing the unconnected lengths into engagement by the abutting of the clipper jaw elements. A pivot member is provided adjacent the connected side wall end of the casing and has at least one blade member pivotably mounted thereon which is receivable in the casing for rotation from a closed position disposed within the casing to an open position generally aligned with the elongated axis of the casing.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Thus, in the present invention, the casing is integrally formed of resiliently deflectable sheet metal and provides a pair of spaced apart side wall portions which provide both unconnected lengths thereof with nail clipper jaw elements on end thereof and a housing for blade-like implements pivotably supported at the other end thereof.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   To protect the user from inadvertent contact with the clipper jaw elements and desirably to provide an additional tool for use by pipe smokers, a jaw protecting element is pivotably mounted on the post and has a portion extendin outwardly of the jaw elements in the operative position. This outwardly projecting portion is desirably planar and overlies substantially the entire end of the casing so that it provides maximum protection and may also be used for tamping tobacco in the&#39;bowl of a smoking pipe. Although this element may have a gene-rally T- shaped portion with the leg portion of the T providing the pivotal mounting portion and extending between the clipper jaw elements, a generally L-shaped member is readily and economically fabricated from sheet metal with one leg being pivotably mounted on the exterior of the side walls of the casing and the other leg providing the outwardly projecting portion overlying the jaw elements. The pivotably mounted portion of the jaw protecting element has an elongated aperture permitting some sliding movement thereof outwardly from the end of the casing to permit pivoting thereof about the end of the casing.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   To enhance further the versatility of the combination implement assembly of the present invention, an elongated pipe reaming element is desirably provided and may be mounted on the exterior of the casing on either the post or the pivot. By pivotably mounting the pipe reaming element on the pivot pin in a position underlying the operating lever, the free end of the lever may be notched to engage the pipe reaming element in the notch to prevent inadvertent relative pivoting therebetween. Alternatively, other interengagin-g means may be provided to limit inadvertent pivoting of the operating lever, and the pipe reaming element may be mounted on the post on the side wall portion opposite that which the operating lever overlies and have its free end engage in a notch or other recess in the casing or in an external portion of the pivot pin.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the preferred embodiments, the lever is apertured adjacent one end and is pivotably engaged in an upwardly extending undercut notch on the post by the configuration of the aperture and the biasing pressure of the unconnected lengths and is configured adjacent its pivoted end in accordance with conventional construction to press the top unconnected length toward engagement with the bottom unconnected length when it is pivoted into operative position from an inoperative position closely overlying the upper side wall portion. On the other end of the casing, a rivet disposed in apertures in the side wall portions provides a pivot member upon which may be mounted a plurality of blade-like implements which are rotatable outwardly from the casing.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Although various means may be provided for resiliently retaining the blade-like elements in operative or housed position such&#39;as separate springs, tight casings, or camtype pivot pins, the preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a plurality of blade-like members wherein the two blade members adjacent the side wall portions may have fiat shanks. In accordance with my copending application Ser. No. 402,409, one or more additional blades may be positioned between the outside blades and each of such inner blades may include a shank having an angular section which is deformed out of the pivotal plane defined when the blade is opened. This deformation may take the form of a dished angular shank section or the shank may have its angular portion split into two sections which are bent in opposite directions generally away from the pivotal plane of the blade. In either form, the desired degree of resiliently sliding, frictional engagement of the shank of the inner blade with its adjacent member is provided to assure that the blade members do not inadvertently fall open and also that when open, it is retained in that pOsitiOn.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This shank configuration provides a leaf spring portion which biases the shanks of the blades in sliding frictional engagement with the shanks of other blades and the side wall portions of the casing so that the blade, when opened, will be restrained in its opened position. Thus, the casing having side wall portions of resilient material together with the angular section of blade with the deformed portion provides surfaces which bear in sliding frictional engagement upon the shanks of the blades adjacent thereto when a blade is being opened and also to retain the blade in its open position when so desired.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring now in detail to the attached drawing, FIG- URES 16 illustrate an embodiment of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">present inven</span>tion which includes a casing integrally formed of resiliently deflectable sheet metal such as steel and is generally designated by the numeral 10.

                        <p>  Thus, it can be seen that the present invention provides a novel combination implement assembly which is relatively compact, highly atractive and relatively inexpensive to manufacture. The casing is integrally formed from a single sheet of resiliently defiectable sheet metal to provide both a nail clipper portion and a cover portion for housing a plurality of blade-like implements. In addition, the pivotable jaw protecting element not only acts as a protector but also as a pipe tamper and a reaming tool is also advantageously included. In this manner, the present invention provides a highly versatile combination implement which is relatively easily assembled from parts which are readily and economically fabricated.   </p>
