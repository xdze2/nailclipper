                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> The disclosure provides nail clippers having a pair of jaws shaped to provide oppositely disposed arcuate cutting edges and biased to an open position with a shield extending around and projecting forwardly of the corners of the cutting edges. The shield also can extend rearwardly from the cutting edges to form manipulating levers for operating the jaws. These can be aesthetically designed to provide the nail clippers with the appearance of an animate object such as a butterfly, or an inanimate object such as a vehicle. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> This is the U.S. national phase of International Application No. PCT/IB02/00552, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    This invention relates to nail clippers and more particularly to clippers used for manicure and pedicure functions.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Nail clippers which have a pair of jaws shaped to form sharpened arcuate co-operating cutting edges at one end and connected together at the other with the length of the jaws bent to bias the jaws to an open position have been widely used for many years.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    An operating lever is hinged to a pin passing through the jaws adjacent the cutting edges to provide means whereby the jaws can be moved together to provide a clipping action.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The construction is narrow making the clippers liable to twisting during use. This together with the sharp corners at the ends of the cutting edges can lead to cutting of the flesh around a finger- or toenail being clipped. This is particularly problematic with young children and infants as an adult usually attends to cutting their nails and can misalign their fingers and toes especially when they wriggle about or resist. The latter often results from fear of the implement used.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    OBJECT OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    It is the object of the present invention to provide nail clippers which are easy to use and less likely to cause injury when used than those presently available.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    According to this invention there is provided nail clippers comprising a pair of jaws shaped to provide oppositely disposed arcuate cutting edges and joined together remote from the cutting edges, the jaws biased to an open position and movable against the bias to enable a nail located between the cutting edges to be cut, with a shield extending around and projecting forwardly of the corners of the cutting edges.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Further features of this invention provide for forward projection of the shield around the corners to follow an arcuate shape; for the shield to extend rearwardly from the cutting edges to form manipulating levers for operating the jaws and for the jaws to be integrally joined.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The invention also provides for the manipulating levers to the shield to carry protrusions slideably engaging in depressions formed in the jaws, for the shield and manipulating levers to be an integral moulding from resilient plastics materials and for the moulding to be securely retained on the jaws by barbed clips engaged on assembly of the jaws between the extensions.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Preferably the manipulating levers carry protrusions in the form of cams shaped and positioned to direct force in use from the levers against the jaws.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Preferably the extensions will provide wide finger grips and be aesthetically designed. In particular they may take the form of butterfly wings.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Another aspect of this invention provides a pair of jaws with co-operating cutting edges for nail clippers comprising a single strip of material having a cutting edge formed at each end with the strip bent to allow the cutting edges to co-operate and the bend or the material of the strip or both providing a resilient biasing of the jaws to an open position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Apertures are preferably provided in the strip, and are sized and shaped to achieve a desired level of resilience in biasing the jaws to an open position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Still further features of the invention provide for a plug to be movably secured at each side of the jaws adjacent the cutting edges to define together with at least one of the jaws and the shield a containing space for material cut by the cutting edges in use; for the plugs to be movable against a bias; for the plugs to be moulded integrally with a flexible body; for the body to be secured between the jaws intermediate and spaced from the cutting edges; for each plug to seat against the shield; and for the plugs to be shaped to respectively resemble the head and body of a butterfly.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The invention extends to a pair of jaws and a shield, separately and apart from each other, each being arranged for use in a novel nail clipper as defined herein.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The invention further includes a nail clipper comprising a pair of jaws shaped to provide oppositely disposed arcuate cutting edges and biased to an open position with moulded plastics finger grips secured on opposite sides of the jaws.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    According to one aspect of the invention there is provided for the finger grips to provide the nail clipper with the appearance of an animate object, including an insect, animal and plant; for the finger grips to particularly provide the nail clipper with the appearance of a winged insect, including a butterfly and bee, or with the appearance of a bird.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided for the finger grips to provide the nail clipper with the appearance on an inanimate object, including a vehicle.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Further features of this invention provide for the finger grips to be broader than the width of the jaws; for the finger grips to be securely retained on the jaws by barbed clips; and for the finger grips to be moulded as an integral unit.  </p>

                        <p>    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  </p>
                    
                        <p>    As illustrated a set of nail clippers consists of a pair of j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ) and a s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">hield ( 2</span> ) with integral e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">xtensions forming manipulating levers ( 3</span> ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ) are shaped from a s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">ingle strip ( 4</span> ) of suitable steel plate. The s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">trip ( 4</span> ) is wider at e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">ach end ( 5</span> ) and ( 6 ) which ends are shaped and sharpened to provide the usual form of co<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">-operating arcuate nail cutting edges ( 7</span> ) and ( 8 ). These edges have c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">orners ( 9</span> ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">trip ( 4</span> ) has a c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">entral aperture ( 10</span> ) in the narrower section and is bent centrally at ( 11 ) so that the c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">utting edges ( 7</span> ) and ( 8 ) are resiliently biased apart but can be dosed together for nail cutting purposes. S<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">tiffening ribs ( 13</span> ) are formed in the s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">trip ( 4</span> ) to provide rigidity between the b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">end ( 11</span> ) and the w<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">ider end sections ( 5</span> ) and ( 6 ). The c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">entral aperture ( 10</span> ) determines the resilience of the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ) and is designed to provide a dosing pressure for the jaws which is comfortable to exert.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">hield ( 2</span> ) is in the form of a moulding of suitable plastics material and e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">xtends around each corner ( 9</span> ) of the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ) while exposing the c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">utting edges ( 7</span> ) and ( 8 ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">hield ( 2</span> ) forms a hinge between the m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">anipulating levers ( 3</span> ) which project away from the cutting edges and over the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ). I<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">nwardly directed protrusions ( 18</span> ) from the m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">anipulating levers ( 3</span> ) slideably engage in d<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">epressions ( 19</span> ) formed in the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">anipulating levers ( 3</span> ) provide finger grips for a user to manipulate the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">hield ( 2</span> ) generally follows the arcuate shape of the c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">utting edges ( 7</span> ) and ( 8 ) but projects forwardly and laterally of these edges.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">anipulating levers ( 3</span> ) are aesthetically shaped so that they resemble the wings of a butterfly and the s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">hield ( 2</span> ) connects the wings in a flared relationship enhancing the resemblance of the assembled nail clippers to a butterfly. The m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">anipulating levers ( 3</span> ) may include reinforcing ribs or other formations to ensure they are sufficiently rigid for use of the clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The plastics mouldings of the s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">hield ( 2</span> ) and m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">anipulating levers ( 3</span> ) is such that the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ) can be forced into position where they are retained by the p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">rotrusion ( 18</span> ) engaging in the d<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">epression ( 19</span> ). The static condition of the moulding and the b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">ent strip ( 4</span> ) are thus such that the components are securely retained together. Preferably barbed clips indicated generally at ( 20 ) are provided on the moulding. These d<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">ips ( 20</span> ) will enable the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ) to be inserted within the moulding but be prevented from withdrawal without the exertion of sufficient force to break the c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">lips ( 20</span> ). This ensures that the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ) cannot be unintentionally removed from the protection of the moulding.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    A set of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">rcuate projections ( 30</span> ) further extends inwardly from each the m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">anipulating levers ( 3</span> ) opposite the s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">hield ( 2</span> ) to abut either side of each of the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ). The p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">rojections ( 30</span> ) assist in aligning the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ) within the moulding, particularly during operation of the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ) and also define the limit to which the m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">anipulating levers ( 3</span> ) can be moved together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    It will be appreciated that many design considerations well within the knowledge of those skilled in the manufacture of mouldings and steel pressings will be included in the final design. These will enable the complete nail clippers to combine ease of manipulation with adequate opening and closing of the jaws under predetermined pressure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    In use the m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">anipulating levers ( 3</span> ) are held in position with the c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">utting edges ( 7</span> ) and ( 8 ) over a nail to be trimmed. The s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">hield ( 2</span> ) limits the depth that the nail can be inserted between the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ) by contact of the end of the finger or toe with the s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">hield ( 2</span> ). This also protects the finger or toe against engagement and injury with either the corner of the c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">utting edges ( 7</span> ) and ( 8 ).  </p>
                    
                        <p> <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">   Plugs ( 21</span> ,  22 ) are provided as an optional accessory and are generally conical in shape. The p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lugs ( <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">21 , 22</span></span> ) are moulded from a resiliently flexible plastics material and are integrally secured together by an e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">longate ribbed body ( 23</span> ) and a t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">hin stem ( 24</span> ), as shown in the insert to FIG.  5 . The b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">ody ( 23</span> ) extends from a side of e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">ach plug ( 21</span> ,  22 ) and is secured between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">jaws( 1</span> ) intermediate the b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">end ( 11</span> ) and the p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">rojections ( 30</span> ) on the m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">anipulating levers ( 3</span> ). The s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">tem ( 24</span> ) extends from the centre of e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">ach plug ( 21</span> ,  22 ) and between the p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">rojections ( 30</span> ) and the s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">hield (<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> 2</spa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">n> ).The plugs ( 21 , 22</span></span> ) are thus biased by the b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">ody ( 23</span> ) and s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">tem ( 24</span> ) into abutment against the sides of the s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">hield ( 2</span> ) and the p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">rojections ( 30</span> ). Together with the s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">hield ( 2</span> ) and j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ), the b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">ody ( 23</span> ) the p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lugs ( 21</span> ,  22 ) provide a containing space for matter entering between the c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">utting <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">edges ( 7 , 8</span></span> ). In use, nail clippings are retained in the space and are collected for later disposal by pulling one of the p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lugs ( 21</span> ,  22 ) away from the s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">hield ( 2</span> ) and allowing the clippings to fall out.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    In this embodiment the p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lugs ( 21</span> ,  22 ) are made in the shape of a b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">utterfly head ( 21</span> ) and b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">ody ( 22</span> ), to match the butterfly shape of the extensions.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Cutting is effected by pressing the m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">anipulating levers ( 3</span> ) towards each other and thus dosing the c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">utting edges ( 7</span> ) and ( 8 ) against each other. During this movement the contacting surfaces between the s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">trip ( 4</span> ) and the moulding slide over each other and the plastics material is preferably chosen to be one which provides inherent lubricating properties. The p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">rotrusions ( 18</span> ) serve to operate as cam surfaces acting on the d<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">epressions ( 19</span> ) in the jaws, to enhance the leverage and reduce the friction between j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ) and s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">hield ( 2</span> ). The cams also direct the force onto the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ) and centralise it, inhibiting any tendency of the blade to twist. The positioning of the cams can be varied in the length of the extensions to change the direction and magnitude of the leverage applied to the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The invention provides nail clippers which are safe, easy to use and which may be made aesthetically attractive. It will be appreciated, however, that many other embodiments of nail clippers exist which fall within the scope if the invention, particularly as regards the configuration thereof. For example, it is not necessary to mould the extensions integrally with the s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">hield ( 2</span> ) or even each other. Instead, the s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">hield ( 2</span> ) could form part of the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aw ( 1</span> ). Also, the m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">anipulating levers ( 3</span> ) can have any suitable shape and need not be in the form of butterfly wings.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The invention also provides a pair of nail clippers which are made aesthetically appealing by the addition of moulded plastics finger grips on opposite sides of the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">aws ( 1</span> ). As illustrated in  FIG. 6  the n<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">ail clippers ( 100</span> ) can be of conventional construction having a pair of j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">aws ( 101</span>   a ,  101   b ) shaped to form sharpen<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">ed arcuate co-operating cutting edges ( 102</span> ) at o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103">ne end ( 103</span> ) and connected together at the o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">ther end ( 104</span> ) with the length of the jaws bent to bias the jaws to an open position. An o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105">perating lever ( 105</span> ) is hinged to a p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">in ( 106</span> ) passing through the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">aws ( 101</span>   a ,  101   b ) adjacent the c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">utting edges ( 102</span> ) to provide means whereby the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">aws ( 101</span>   a ,  101   b ) can be moved together to provide a clipping action. According to the invention a f<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">inger grip ( 110</span>   a ) is secured to the l<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105">ever ( 105</span> ) and a f<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">urther finger grip ( 110</span>   b ) to the outer side of the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">aw ( 101</span>   b ). In this embodiment the f<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">inger grips ( 110</span>   a ,  110   b ) are secured to the n<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">ail clipper ( 100</span> ) using an adhesive.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The f<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">inger grips ( 110</span>   a ,  110   b ) are identical and similarly shaped to those described above to also provide the n<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">ail clippers ( 100</span> ) with the appearance of a butterfly.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    By providing the nail clippers with an attractive appearance, such as a butterfly, they have been found to be appealing to children who, as a result, are less likely to struggle when having their nails clipped. It will be appreciated that the finger grips can be made to make the nail clippers resemble any suitable animate or inanimate object. The former includes animals, insects and plants while the latter includes vehicles. Thus, for example, the finger grips could be formed to look like the wings of a bird or bee, or to look like flower petals or leaves, or even to look like a motorcar or train. Preferably the object selected allows an identically shaped finger grip to be depicted.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    While it is preferable that the finger grips are wider than the width of the jaws to enhance a user&#39;s purchase they may in fact be of similar width to that of the jaws. </p>
