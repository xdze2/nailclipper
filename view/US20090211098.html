                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> TECHNICAL FIELD  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    This invention pertains generally to personal grooming devices and more particularly to disposable nail clippers and methods for using the same.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    Personal grooming devices, including nail clippers, frequently carry bacteria and other pathogens due to their contact with body tissues. Because bacteria and other pathogens from one person can be harmful to another, it is generally recommended that such devices be restricted to only one user or undergo robust sterilization before being used by another. Such restriction or sterilization, however, is difficult, if not impracticable, in certain environments such as athletic training rooms.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    Nail clippers of the prior art do not address the hygiene issues relating to use by many different persons, and so must be sterilized between uses by different persons if the desired level of hygiene is to be achieved. However, sterilization not only increases the cost of supplies, i.e., sterilization fluids and vessels, but also increases the time delay between uses of the clippers. In addition, sterilization requires personnel time to perform or oversee the sterilization, thus further increasing costs.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    In view of the foregoing, it is desirable to have nail clippers that do not need to be sterilized between uses. One solution is to provide for disposable clippers. Another solution is to provide for clippers that have disposable portions subject to contamination by a user.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0005]    The presently disclosed nail clipper includes a body comprising at least a first arm and a second arm and at least one cutting edge portion. The arms are linked to each other such that they oppose each other at the location of the cutting edge and contact each other by user operation. The cutting edge is mounted to one of the arms such that it opposes the other arm.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    More particularly, each arm has a proximal and distal end wherein the distal end of at least one of the two arms has formed therein a receptacle adopted to receive a cutting edge portion, which has a generally complementary shape so as to reside either permanently or temporarily, within the receptacle. While the disclosed embodiment locates the cutting edge at the very end of the distal end, such location is not necessary. As described above, it is only necessary that the location for the cutting edge permit it to contact the other arm when the nail clipper is manipulated by the user.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    In one disclosed embodiment, the body has two similarly sized, polymeric arms, each having a proximal end and a distal end with a receptacle for a metal cutting edge portion. Each arm preferably has a slight bend so that it is not planar. The arms are joined to each other at their proximal ends thus forming a “V” shape.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    Depending upon the desired configuration, the disposable embodiment will have the cutting edge portion(s) permanently affixed to the arm(s) while the reusable embodiment will removably locate the cutting edge portion(s) in the receptacle(s).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    With respect to the reusable embodiment, the receptacle formed in each distal end is preferably a groove or slot having a base portion and a neck portion. Each cutting edge has a shaped portion generally complementary to the slot or groove. To permit retention of the cutting edge in the receptacle, the base portion of the slot or groove of the arm and the base portion of the cutting edge shaped portion have wider profiles than the neck portions. In this manner, the cutting edge can be mated with the groove or slot during manufacture, after which it is retained therein in a manner similar to that of a dovetail joint. In an alternate embodiment, the groove or slot extends the entire width of the arm&#39;s end, and the cutting edge is mated with the groove or slot by laterally sliding the cutting edge into the groove or slot, after which it is retained therein in a manner similar to a dovetail joint. Alternatively, the cutting edges can define the slots and the distal ends of the arms can form corresponding protrusions. The arms can then be manipulated in a traditional manner such that the cutting edges will be squeezed together, thereby cutting an object, e.g., fingernail or toenail, that is positioned between them.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    As is well known in the art, a lever is preferably located on a stud or shank that links the lever arm to one body arm wherein the second body arm is free to move axially along the stud. The lever arm provides sufficient force to the distal end of the clipper upon user manipulation to cut a nail placed between the cutting edge(s). While the disclosed embodiment relies on the lever arm interacting directly on one of the body arms, it is also contemplated that the lever arm can act directly on the cutting edge, thereby eliminating force transmission through the body arm. By positioning the stud proximate the non-moving body arm, stress inherent therein during use of the clippers can also be reduced. The lever arm can be, of course, used in either the disposable or the reusable embodiment.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    The present invention thus provides for a disposable nail clipper and, alternatively, the removal and replacement of disposable cutting edges of a non-disposable nail clipper. With this invention, different users can each use a new and sterile nail clipper or can use one nail clipper body many times, using new and sterile cutting edges every time. Eliminating the necessity of sterilization between each use results in significant cost and time savings. In addition to these benefits, this invention also enhances the safety and protection of athletes and others who come into contact with them by providing a quick and easy way to ensure short, neatly trimmed nails.  </p>

The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">arms  12</span>  and  14  are generally flat but are bent slightly at a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">point  20</span> a to create a divergence. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">distal end  22</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">each arm  12</span>  and  14  is curved slightly inward, beginning at a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">point  20</span>   b , in the direction opposite from the bend.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]    The first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">second arms  12</span>  and  14  are formed from a substantially rigid material. Exemplary materials to form the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">second arms  12</span>  and  14  include metals, composites, and polymeric material; however, it should be appreciated that other known material having suitable rigidity and durability can be used.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]    A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">cutting edge portion  50</span>  is fixedly secured to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">distal end  22</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">each arm  12</span>  and  14 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">Each cutting edge portion  50</span>  is secured to its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">respective arm  12</span>  and  14  by forming the arm around a section of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">cutting edge portion  50</span>  during the manufacturing process so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">cutting edge portion  50</span>  is restrained against movement in all directions relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">arm  12</span>  and  14 . In alternate embodiments, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">each cutting edge portion  50</span>  may be fixedly secured to its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">respective arm  12</span>  and  14  using known adhesives, mechanical fasteners, interference fit, or other suitable means.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">[0021]    Each cutting edge portion  50</span>  is formed from a metallic material, but alternately can be formed from any suitable material of with sufficient properties to serve as a cutting edge without failing and capable of maintaining a sufficiently sharp cutting edge.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]    Still referring to  FIG. 1 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">proximal ends  18</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">arms  12</span>  and  14  are secured together with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">rivet  34</span>  or other mechanical fastener so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">ends  18</span>  are held firmly together. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">arms  12</span>  and  14  diverge from each other as they extend away from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">rivet  34</span>  so that the arms form a “V” or “Y” configuration. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">distal ends  22</span>  are curved toward each other so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">blades  32</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cutting edge portions  28</span>  attached thereto are opposed to each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]    A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">shank  36</span>  extends orthogonally from distal the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">end  22</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first arm  12</span>  through a hole in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">distal end  22</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">second arm  14</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">shank  36</span>  engages the hole to align the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">two opposed arms  12</span>  and  14  and also the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">associated cutting edge portions  28</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    Similar to the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">second arms  12</span>  and  14 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever  16</span>  has a generally flat and elongated rectangular form that includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">proximal end  38</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">distal end  40</span> . The lever further includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">fulcrum  42</span>  located on one side of the lever between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">proximal end  38</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">distal end  40</span> , but nearer to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">distal end  40</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">distal end  40</span>  is attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">shank  36</span>  so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever  16</span>  is aligned with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">second arm  14</span> , as shown in  FIG. 1 , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">fulcrum  42</span>  abuts the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">second arm  14</span>  just behind the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">shank  36</span> . Like the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">second arms  12</span>  and  14 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever  16</span>  is formed from a substantially rigid material, such as a metal, composite, or polymeric material.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]    A user operates the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span>  by positioning the nail to be clipped between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cutting edge portions  28</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span>  and applying a force to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">proximal end  38</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever  16</span>  to bias the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">proximal end  38</span>  of the lever toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">proximal end  18</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">second arm  14</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">fulcrum  42</span>  functions to transfer the pressure to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">distal end  22</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">second arm  14</span> , which in turn slides along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">shank  36</span>  toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first arm  12</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">opposed cutting edge portions  28</span>  are thus forced together, thereby cutting the nail positioned therebetween.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]    A user positions nails between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cutting edge portions  28</span>  and proceeds to clip nails as necessary. Unlike known nail clippers, the body of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">disclosed nail clipper  10</span>  need not be metal. Accordingly, less expensive polymeric materials may be used, greatly reducing manufacturing costs and lessening the economic disincentive to dispose of the nail clipper after a single use. As a result, when the user&#39;s application is complete, the user simply disposes of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">entire nail clipper  10</span> . A different user, or the same user on a different occasion, simply begins the procedure all over again with a new, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">sterile nail clipper  10</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]    A first alternate embodiment is shown in  FIGS. 2 and 3 , wherein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span>  is similar to the previously described embodiment except that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cutting edge portions  28</span>  are removably coupled to the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">second arms  12</span>  and  14 . As best shown in  FIG. 3 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">distal end  22</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">each arm  12</span>  and  14  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">end face  24</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">receptacle  26</span>  is formed in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">each end face  24</span>  and is adapted to receive a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cutting edge portion  28</span>  to removably couple the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cutting edge portion  28</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">arm  12</span>  and  14 . In the illustrated embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">receptacle  26</span>  has a triangular cross-section and extends through the width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">end face  24</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cutting edge portion  28</span>  is as wide as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">end face  24</span>  and has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">tab  30</span>  with a cross-section that complements the cross-section of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">receptacle  26</span> . In the illustrated embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">tab  30</span>  has a generally triangular cross-section and fits into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">receptacle  26</span>  to form a dovetail connection; however, it should be appreciated that any number of possible complementary cross-sections can be utilized to secure the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">tab  30</span>  within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">receptacle  26</span> . In addition,  FIG. 4  shows a second alternate embodiment, wherein a receptacle is located on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cutting edge portion  28</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">tab  44</span>  is located on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">each end  22</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">arms  12</span>  and  14 , thereby defining a reverse dovetail arrangement that removably secures the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cutting edge portion  28</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">arms  12</span>  and  14 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0029]    The most acute corner of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cutting edge portion  28</span>  forms a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">sharp blade  32</span> , which is directed toward the inside of the bend of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">arm  12</span>  and  14  when the cutting edge portion is coupled to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">arms  12</span>  and  14 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">blade  32</span>  is curved to match the curve of an average fingernail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0030]    In use, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cutting edges portions  28</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span>  are replaceable by removing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">old cutting edge portions  28</span>  and inserting new cutting edge portions into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">arms  12</span>  and  14 . To insert a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cutting edge portion  28</span> , the user simply aligns the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">receptacle  26</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">tab  30</span> , as shown in  FIG. 3 , and slides the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cutting edge  28</span>  into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> . As shown in  FIG. 5 , the mating surfaces of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cutting edge portion  28</span>  and the receptacle optionally include raised bumps that engage corresponding dimples when the cutting edge portion is inserted, thereby preventing relative movement between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cutting edge portion  28</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">arm  12</span>  and  14 . Preferably, the bumps are on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cutting edge portions  28</span> , and the dimples are on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">plastic arms  12</span>  and  14 . With the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">new cutting edges  28</span>  in place, the user can proceed to clip nails. When the first application is complete, the user can remove the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cutting edges  28</span>  by simply reversing the above procedure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0031]    While illustrative embodiments have been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as claimed. </p>
