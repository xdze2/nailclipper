Application for reissue Oct. 14, 1966, Ser. No. 595,548   </p>
                    
                        <p>   8 Claims. (Cl. 30-142) Matter enclosed in heavy brackets appears in the original patent but forms no part of this reissue specification; matter printed in italics indicates the additions made by reissue.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE My invention relates to a combined tool providing nailclipper and cutting-blade functions.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is an object of the invention to provide an improved device of the character indicated. Specifically, it is an object to provide such a device with safety features assuring against exposure of sharp edges when folded to inoperative position and positively referencing the cutting blade when extended for use. It is also an object to meet the foregoing objects with a tool of elemental simplicity and which is effective and foolproof in operation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Other objects and various further features of novelty and invention will be pointed out or will occur to those skilled in the art from a reading of the following specification in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. In said drawings, which show. for illustrative purposes only, preferred forms of the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 1 is a view in perspective showing a preferred tool of the invention, the parts being folded into inoperative position;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 2 is a plan view of the tool of FIG. 1, with the cutting blade swung to its extended or operative position;   </p>
                    
                        <p>  FIG. 3 is a side elevation of the tool of FIG. 1;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 4 is a view similar to FIG. 3 but showing the relation of parts when the jaw-actuating lever has been raised from inoperative position;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 5 is a plan view of the blank for the cutting-blade element of FIG. 1;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 6 is a plan view of the element of FIG. 5, after forming to its ultimate shape;   </p>
                    
                        <p>  FIG. 7 is a left-end view of the element of FIG. 6;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 8 is a plan view of the blank for a modified form of cutling-blade element; and   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 9 is a plan view of the formed blank of FIG. 8, shown in assembled relation with parts of a clipper, parts of the latter being broken away and partly in phantom.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Briefly stated, the invention contemplates an improved combined tool featuring a conventional lever-actuated nail clipper with a cutlingblade element pivotally secured thereto, in such manner that the cutting edge of said element is secured in a safe protected position when the tool is in inoperative condition, and in such manner that Re. 26,344 Reissued Feb. 13, 1968 ICC the cutting edge is positively referenced to the handle when the cutting-blade element is extended for use. The foregoing is achieved without in any way impairing nailclippcr functions or effectiveness and without requiring any change in formation of standard nail-clipper parts.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring to FIGS. 1 to 7 of the drawings, the invention is shown in application to a standard nail-clipper construction, which happens to be of the swingable, reversiblc-lever type, exemplified in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> Basset<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem477">t Patent 2,477</span></span>,- 782. Thus, the illustrated clipper comprises opposed elongated jaw members 10-11 of stifily yieldable material such as steel. Jaw members 1041 are connected as by spot-welding at one end, and they diverge to provide normally spaced cutting jaws 1213 at the other end. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> headed pin or rivet 14</span> passes through aligned openings in the jaw members near the cutting jaws, and an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> actuating lever 15</span> is formed with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> bridge 16</span> received in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> slot 17</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> rivet 14</span>, to hold the parts in assembled relation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   If desired, and as also shown in said patent, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> file member 18</span> may be pivotally connected by an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> eyelet 19</span> to the connected end of the jaw members 10-11,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> file member 18</span> being formed with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> spaced upstanding lugs 20</span> to receive, locate and retain the free end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> lever 15</span> when folded as in the position shown in FIGS. 1 to 3. In this folded position,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> feet 21</span>, which extend beyond<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> bridge 16</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> engage jaw member 10</span> just beyond the longitudinal location at<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> which <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">bridge 16</span> engages rivet slot 17</span>. law members Ill-11, when unstressed, are spread apart much more than when assembled; therefore. in the assembled condition, the resilient stress or prcload on jaw members 10-11 is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> reflected via bridge 16</span> as a strong downward force to urge the free end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> lever <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">15</span> against file mom bcr 18</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As noted above.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> layer 15</span> is of the swingablc, reversible type, meaning that it must be reversed in order to perform its jaw-actuating function. This is done by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> raising lever 15</span> from the FIG. 1 position to the FIG. 4 position, and by then swinging the extended lever about the axis of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> rivet 14</span>. This operation brings a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> bulbous lobe or cam 22</span> into adjacency with the top or outer surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> upper jaw member 10</span>, so that subsequent lever depression cams the cutting jaws 1213 together, in conventional fashion.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In accordance with the invention. I provide a cuttingblade function for the described clipper, without requiring any change of clipper parts. The cutting implement is shown as an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> elongated knife edge 23</span> formed at the cutting end of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade element 24</span>, having at its other end a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> hub 25</span>, so that it may be pivotully secured by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> eyelet 19</span> lo the outer surface of one of the jaw membcrs 10-11; preferably,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> eyelet 19</span> is tightly set, so that a good measure of torsional friction characterizes the swinging action of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> both file 18</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade member 24</span>, each independently of the other. (In the form of FIGS. 1 to 7,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade member 24</span> is secured to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaw member 11</span>, and in the form of FIGS. 8 and 9,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade member 24</span>&#39; is secured to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> jaw member 10</span>.)   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As best seen in FIGS. 5 to 7, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade element 24</span> is formed from a fiat blank, bent along creases 2627 to define an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> elongated lateral offset 28</span>, which assures that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> blade 23</span> will be received in the space between jaw members 10-11 when in inoperative position. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> offset 28</span> also serves a dualstop function, limiting swinging movement of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade member 24</span> when moved to inoperativc position. and limiting swinging movement of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade member 24</span> when moved to the extended or operative position (FIG. 2); at the first of these stop positions,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> offset 28</span> abuts the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> adjacent edge 29</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> lower jaw member 11</span>, and at the second of these stop positions,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> offset 28</span> abuts the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> opposite edge 30</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaw member 11</span>. in which case firm reference is established to the clipper body to enable the same to be an effective handle when cutting with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> edge 23</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is an important feature of the invention that means are provided for positive clamping retention of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade member 24</span>, when in inoperative position. This is accomplished by clamping the jaw members -11 against opposed faces of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> blade 23</span> when handle is set into folded inoperative position (FIG. 3). In this connection, it will be noted that in the inoperative position (FIG. 3) the cutting edges of jaws 12-13 are spaced a distance d which is less than the distance d which applies when<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> lever 15</span> is raised (FIG. 4). I so locate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> heel region 31</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> blade 23</span>. in relation to the thickness of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> blade 23</span> and in relation to the varying spacing of jaw members 10-11 (as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> lever 15</span> is operated between the FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 positions) that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> heel 31</span> will freely enter the space between jaw member 10-11 when<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> lever 15</span> is in the FIG. 4 position, but such that on the other hand the FIG. 3 position will establish tempted swinging entry of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> blade 23</span> into the space between aw members 10-11. For this relationship, it will be understood that,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> if blade 23</span> <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">is swung into closed position while lever 15</span> is raised (FIG. 4), then subsequent lowering of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> lever 15</span> to the FIG. 3 position will involve cammed clamping of jaw members 10-11 against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> heel 31</span>, assuring tight retention of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> blade 23</span> when not in use. On the other hand, by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> raising lever 15</span> to the FIG. 4 position. the clamp action is relieved, and finger actuation against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> offset 28</span> or against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> extended hub edge 32</span> will easily bring the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> blade 23</span> into operative position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As a further feature of the described embodiment, it will be noted that the structural relation of parts inherently permits effective retention of the blade in the event that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> lever 15</span> has been lowered to its inoperative position (FIGS. 1 and 3) before the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> knife blade 24</span> is swung into its inoperative position. In this particular event. the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> heel 31</span> of the blade will interfere with the inner faces of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> jaw members 10</span>. 11 as the heel enters the space between these jaw members. Finger pressure applied to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> flange 28</span> in the direction of closing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade 24</span> to its inoperative position will necessarily locally cam the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> jaw members 10</span>. 11 slightly apart, thereby assuring positive frictional retention of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> folded blade 24</span>. It will be understood that the extent of slight jaw-spreading action achievable in this manner may be enhanced by slanting or tapering the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> heel 31</span> orientation in the direction of the hub as indicated by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> heavy dashed line 31</span>&#39; in FIG. 5.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   ln combined tools of the character indicated in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> which no file or equivalent member 18</span> is desired, I prefer the embodiment of FIGS. 8-9 which utilizes essentially the same<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade member 24</span> as described previously at 24. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade member 24</span> is shown with primed notation as to reference numerals which correspond with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> those already described for lade member 24</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade member 24</span>&#39; is fastened by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> eyelet 19</span> to the top surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> upper jaw mem<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">ber 10</span> (there being no file member 15</span> in FIG. 9), and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> offset<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> 28</span> positions blade 23</span>&#39; for reception in the space between jaw members 10-11. In addition, for one location in the region of overlap between<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> lever 15</span> and hub portion I provide locking means enacting between these overlapping elements. The locking means is shown as spaced lugs 33-34 struck up from and out of the body of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> hub portion 25</span>&#39;. the spacing being such as to receive and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> locate lever 15</span> when folded, as shown in FIG. 9. In this situation. it w ll be appreciated that the clamping action on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> blade 23</span>&#39;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> not only holds blade 23</span> firmly in place when<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> lever 15</span> is in closed position but also the lugs 33-34 are thus firmly referenced to provide e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">qually firm retention reference for lever 15</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Quite aside from. and in certain cases independent of, the clamping action of ,irluw 10-11 on the lice! of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> blade 23</span>. the (inscription of po ts for FIGS. 3 our] 4 is opp/i- (uh/1&#39; to another (m re! of the invention, wherein cullrmr&#39;crl fritliouul of hhult&#39; .73 (in chiral position) results from an interference upon atthe compressional displacement of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> jaws 10-11 (1.?

T his further aspect of the invention is important should fluctuations in nuuurfacturing tolerances he .ruch as to render negligible or uou-raristcut the described binding or clamping action (between<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> blade 23</span> am! from 10-11 According to this further aspect of the invention, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade element 24</span> is initially formed with a bent contour (as viewed in side elevation) to .rulxrtuurially match or conform to the contour of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaw 11</span> when jaws 10-11 are in the lcssstrariFri state (FIG. 4). Thus, in the unstressed uszsrvuhlcd note of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade rucmbcr 24</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> blade portion 23</span> thereof liar flat against the inner surface of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaw 11</span>, as shown in FIG. 4, while the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> hub 25</span> and its extension. 40 (FIGS. 2, 5, 6) lie in close conformance with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaw 11</span>, in its more relaxed (FIG. 4) slate.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> Upon moving lcrcr 15</span> to its closed position (FIG. 3), jaw I1 is deflected as it is further compressed, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> deflection fr resisted li y blade 23</span>, thus adding to the degree of frictional retention of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> blrulc 23</span>, for the FIG. 3 situation. Stated in other words, the blade curl of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade member 24</span> is in interference relation with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> ruljoccut<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> jaw 11</span> upon swinging blade number 24</span> to closed position when<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> lever 15</span> is in its lowered (closed) position (FIG. 3), thus assuring the cicscribcd deflection resistance and frictional retention which is obtained when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> lever 15</span> is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lowered after hlrule member 24</span> has been swung to closed position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   While I have described the invention in detail for the preferred forms illustrated, it will be understood that modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the claims which follow.   </p>
