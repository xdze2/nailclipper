                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> 1. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    A. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0002]    The embodiments of the present invention relate to a clipper having cutting jaws for cutting nails and preventing nail clippings formed thereby from scattering, and more particularly, the embodiments of the present invention relate to a clipper having cutting jaws for cutting nails and preventing nail clippings formed thereby from scattering by having the cutting jaws be a part of a receptacle for the nail clippings when the cutting jaws are closed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    B. Description of the Prior Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    A particular problem encountered in manicures and pedicures is the resultant creation of errant nail clippings. Such clippings are produced to a great degree when nail clippers are used to trim one&#39;s nails because the jaws of the clippers compress the nail when trimming, thus flattening its natural curve. When the nail is trimmed off, it snaps back to its natural shape, thus projecting the clipping into the most unpredictable trajectories or landing places. These nail trimmings could conceivably, for example, lodge in the user&#39;s eye with grave consequences, but usually find their way into the pile of a carpet or on a floor not to be found again until some unsuspecting person in bare feet steps on the nail clipping, possibly resulting in injury to the unprotected foot.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    Numerous innovations for nail clippers have been provided in the prior art that will be described below in chronological order to show advancement in the art, and which are incorporated herein by reference thereto. Even though these innovations may be suitable for the specific individual purposes to which they address, however, they differ from the present invention in that they do not teach a clipper having cutting jaws for cutting nails and preventing nail clippings formed thereby from scattering by having the cutting jaws be a part of a receptacle for the nail clippings when the cutting jaws are closed. completely covers the lower jaw with the retainer box, preventing any clippings from being scattered during the clipping process.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    (6) U.S. Pat. No. 5,214,854 to Mennicken.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    U.S. Pat. No. 5,214,854 issued to Mennicken on Jun. 1, 1993 in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> class 30</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem186"> subclass 186</span> teaches a spring-biased nipper having a pair of handles connected for pivoting movement toward and away from each other. A helical spring has first and second cylindrical ends and a relatively wide central portion tapering toward each end. One end of the spring is threadably received in a bore formed on an inner side of one of the handles. An unthreaded bore on the opposite handle receives the other end of the spring. The spring biases the nipper handles away from one another when a user&#39;s grasp on the handles relaxes. In a second embodiment, one end of the spring is glued into the unthreaded bore formed in one of the handles.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    (7) U.S. Pat. No. 6,473,969 to Rinaldi.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    U.S. Pat. No. 6,473,969 issued to Rinaldi on Nov. 5, 2002 in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> class 30</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> subclass 28</span> teaches a tool for the hygiene and cutting of cuticles, fingernails, and toenails. Two interchangeable jaws are provided with respective cutting blades and are removably supported by two jaw holders connected to respective handles for gripping the tool itself. The jaw holders and the handles are mutually hinged to rotate the aforementioned jaws between an open position and a closed and cutting position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    (8) Japanese Application Publication Number JP10151280 to Kazuharu et al.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    Japanese Application Publication Number JP10151280 published to Kazuharu et al. on Jun. 9, 1998 in class B26B17 and subclass 00 teaches a tool to prevent chips from scattering when using a cutting pliers, nipper, etc. The tool is provided with cutting tools, a chip-scattering prevention cover, and an attaching mechanism attached to either the cutting tool or the chip-scattering prevention cover for attaching the chip-scattering prevention cover to the cutting tool. The attaching mechanism has at least either a function of attaching/detaching the chip-scattering prevention cover with the cutting tools or a function of changing the cover position relative to the cutting tools to prevent chips cut by the cutting tools from scattering.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    It is apparent that numerous innovations for nail clippers have been provided in the prior art that are adapted to be used. Furthermore, even though these innovations may be suitable for the specific individual purposes to which they address, however, they would not be suitable for the purposes of the embodiments of the present invention as heretofore described, namely, a clipper having cutting jaws for cutting nails and preventing nail clippings formed thereby from scattering by having the cutting jaws be a part of a receptacle for the nail clippings when the cutting jaws are closed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        2. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0013]    Thus, an object of the embodiments of the present invention is to provide a clipper having cutting jaws for cutting nails and preventing nail clippings formed thereby from scattering by having the cutting jaws be a part of a receptacle for the nail clippings when the cutting jaws are closed, which avoids the disadvantages of the prior art.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0014]    Briefly stated, another object of the embodiments of the present invention is to provide an improved clipper of the type having a pair of pivoted members pivotally attached to each other by a pivot pin and having cutting jaws for cutting nails and being biased away from each other by a spring. The improvement includes a catching member. The catching member is non-rotationally mounted to one of the pair of pivoted members, and together with the cutting jaws, form a receptacle for the nail clippings when the cutting jaws are closed to thereby prevent the nail clippings from scattering.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0015]    The novel features considered characteristic of the embodiments of the present invention are set forth in the appended claims. The embodiments of the present invention themselves, however, both as to their construction and their method of operation together with additional objects and advantages thereof will be best understood from the following description of the specific embodiments when read and understood in connection with the accompanying drawing.  </p>
