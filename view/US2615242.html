                        <p>  INVENTOR.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Patented Oct. 28, 1952 UNITED STATES TENT OFFICE COldBINATION FINGERNAIL FILE, FINGER- NAIL CLIPPER, AND<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> POCKET CLIP 1</span> Claim.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention relates to a combined fingernail file, nail clipper and combination clipper lever and pocket clip.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The primary object of the invention is to provide a fingernail file having a resiliently operable clipper extension and a lever means for operating the clipper, the lever means being of such construction that when moved into a particular position will serve as a pocket clip. Not only will the file and clipper be capable of ready suspension in a pocket, but because of this the device will include a relatively long and useful file rather than the short useless files found on conventional files and clippers presently on the market. The present device is also inexpensive and easy to operate.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   These, together with various ancillary objects and features of the invention which will later become apparent as the following description proceeds, are attained by the device, a preferred embodiment of which has been illustrated, by way of example only, in the accompanying drawings, wherein:   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Figure 1 is a perspective view of the device;   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Figure 2 is a side elevation;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 3 is a top plan view with the combined lever and pocket clip removed;   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Figure 4 is a top plan View of the entire device;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 5 is a sectional view taken on the line 5-5 of Figure 1; and   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 6 is a side view of the device shown suspended on a pocket, the latter being shown in section.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Specific reference will now be made to the drawings. In the several views, in the accompanying drawings and in the following specification, similar reference characters indicate corresponding elements throughout.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The present device comprises an elongated nail file I0 having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> pointed end 12</span> and an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> opposite resilient bifurcated end 14</span> having normally spread apart members or furcations IB and I8 terminating in finger-nail clipping jaws or cutters 2D. Extending slidably through the furcations is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> rivet or pin 22</span> having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> head 24</span> at its bottom end and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> hook-shaped cam slot 26</span> adjacent its free end.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A combined lever and pocket clip is provided in the form of an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> elongated tapered bar 28</span> having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> knob 30</span> at one end thereof, the opposite end being a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> forked extension 32</span> at an angle to the axis of said bar, the forked extension having<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> furcat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">ions or legs 34 and 36</span></sp<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">an> straddling said pin 22</span> and carrying a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> pin 38</span> engaged in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> hook-shaped slot 26</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> headed pin 22</span>. The legs have<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> cams 40</span> which bear on the furcation I8 of the clipper so that when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> lever bar 28</span> is urged towards the file ID, the jaws of the clipper will close. On both sides of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> pin 22</span>, the furcation I8 is provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> longitudinal grooves 42</span> while the 2 free ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> legs 3<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">4 and 36</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> fork 32</span> are provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> upstanding lips or flanges 44</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In use, a movement of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> lever 28</span> towards the file will close the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> jaws 20</span>. If the lever is moved through a angle and then moved toward the file, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> flanges 44</span> will engage in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> grooves 42</span> and hold the lever as a pocket clip capable of engaging the flap d6 of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> pocket 4</span>.8. Thus, the lever functions as a means for operating the clipper and as a means for suspending the device on and in a pocket.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In view of the foregoing description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, it is believed that a clear understanding of the device will be quite apparent to those skilled in this art. A more detailed description is accordingly deemed unnecessary.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is to be understood, however, that even though there is herein shown and described a preferred embodiment of the invention, the same is susceptible to certain changes fully compre-v hended by the spirit of the invention as herein described and within the scope of the appended claim.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having described the invention, what claimed as new is:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A manicure instrument of the character described comprising a pair of elongated, resilient, divergent jaw members secured together at one end, coacting blades on the free ends of said members, a headed, notched rivet swivelly mounted on one of the members and extending rotatably through the other of said members, said other member having longitudinal grooves therein adjacent the rivet, and a reversible operating lever for closing the members, said lever including. furcations on one end straddling the rivet, a pin extending between the furcations at an intermediate point and engaged in the notch of the rivet for operatively connecting said lever thereto, longitudinal cams on one side of the furcations inwardly of the pin and engageable with said other member for closing the members when the lever is in operating position, and lips on the other side of the furcations outwardly of the pin, operable in the grooves and engageable with said other member for securing the lever in reversed position.   </p>
