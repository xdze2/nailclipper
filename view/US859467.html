                        <p>  Application filed January 21, 1907. S a NO- 353,334.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, ERNEST H. SrroDnARn, a citizen of the United States, residing at Orange, in the county of Franklin and State of Massachusetts, have invented .a new and useful Manicure Implement, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention relates to manicure implements and has for its object to provide a comparatively simple and inexpensive device of this character especially designed for trimming and manicuring the finger nails and which may be conveniently folded and carried in the pocket.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  A further object of the invention is to provide a manicure implement including a pair of shears the cutting edges of which terminate in inwardly extending arms constituting tweezers, said shears having combined therewith a file, knife and piercing point or needle.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A further object is to provide a longitudinally movable guard for protecting the cutting edge of the knife when the instrument is carried in the pocket, said guard also serving to lock the pivoted legs of the shears in closed or inoperativeposition.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A still further object of the invention is to generally improve this class of devices so as to increase their utility, durability and efficiency as well as to reduce&#39;the cost of manufacture.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Further objects and advantages will appear in the following description, it being understood that various changes in form, proportions and minor details of con- &#34;striic&#39;tion may be resorted to within the scope of the appended claims.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the accompanying drawings forming a part of this specification: Figure 1 is a top plan view of a manicure implement constructed in accordance with my invention showing the several parts in locked or assembled position. Fig. 2 is a similar view showing the locking member released and showing in dotted lines the piercing point or needle moved laterally to operative position. Fig. 3 is a bottom plan view of Fig. 1. Fig. 4 is a longitudinal sectional view takenon the line 4-4 of Fig. 3. Fig. 5 is a transverse sectional view taken on the line 5-5 of Fig. 4. Fig. 6 is a perspective view partly in section of one end of the implement showing the concaved upper surface of the shearing members.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Similar numerals of reference indicate corresponding parts in all of the figures of the. drawings.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The improved device consists of a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> sheari<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">ng members or legs 5 and 6</span></span> having their inner longitudinal edges over-lapped and pivotally united by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> ascrew or similar fastening device 7</span> andhaving their outer edges provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> longitudinal reinforcing flanges 8</span> so. that the shearing members may be convenientlygrasped in the hand when operating the same. 7   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The upper surfaces of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> shearing members 5</span> and G are preferably concaved, as shown and provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> co-acting cutting edges 9</span>, the&#39;metal&#39; at said cutting edges being cut away, as indicated at 10 and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> reinforcing flanges 8</span> of said members bent laterally to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> form inwardly extending arms 11</span> constituting tweezers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   One end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> shearing member 5</span> is extended beyond the adjacent end of the mating member to form a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> knife 12</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> cutting edges 13</span> of which are preferably inclined towards one end of the iinplement to form a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> terminal point 14</span> which may be used for removing dirt and other foreign matter from beneath the finger nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As a means for locking the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> shearing members 5</span> and G in closed or inoperative position there is provided<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> a longitudinally movable locking member 15</span> preferably in the form of a flat plate having an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> elongated slot 16</span> formed therein for thereception of the pivot pin or screw &#39;7 and having its slotted end curved to conform to the general contour of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> knife 12</span>, the opposite end of said plate or looking member being reduced to form a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> piercing point or needle 17</span> designed to extract slivers from the skin or for removing black-heads, or puncturing pimples and for other purposes.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The reduced end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> locking member or plate 15</span> is provided with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> elongated slot 18</span> opening through one side of the plate and defining sp<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">aced longitudinally disposed locking lips 19</span> adapted to engage a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> locking pin 20</span> secured to or formed integral with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> shearing member 6</span>, there being a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> transverse recess 21</span> formed in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> shearing member 5</span> for the reception of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> pin 20</span>, as shown.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> locking member 15</span> is preferably provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> knob or finger piece 22</span> by means of which the locking member may be conveniently moved to operative and inoperative position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Seated between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> flanges 8</span> and preferably disposed at the pivotal juncture of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> sheari<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">ng members 5 and 6</span></span> is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> reinforcing plate 23</span> having its exposed surface roughened to form a file, said plate&#39;being rigidly secured to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> sheari<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ng member 6</span> bya rivet 24</span> and the locking screw25.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  - The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> locking screw 25</span> bears againstthe adjacent end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> pivot pin or screw 7</span> <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">and thereby locks said pivot pin or screw 7</span> against accidental rotation on the shearing members.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The shearing members-5 and 6 are normally and A yieldably supported inopen or operative positionby means of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> a-spring 27</span> one end of which bears against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> flange 8</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> shearing member 6</span> while the opposite end thereof extends through a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> recess or chamber 28</span> formed in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> file 23</span> and is seated in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> perforation 29</span> formed in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> flange 8</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> shearing member 5</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  &#39; Attention is called to the fact that one end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> shearing member 5</span> is extended longitudinally beyond the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> plate or file 23</span> and is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> laterally extending stop lug 3</span> which by engagement with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> flange 8</span> on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> shearing member 5</span> serves .to limit the. lateral movement of said shearing member. It will inoperative position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  also be observed that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> pin 20</span> by engagement with the wall of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> slot 21</span> serves to limit the inward movement of the shearing members and thus prevents the terminals of the tweezers from coming in contact with each other when the shears are in closed position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> guiding lug 31</span> is secured to or formed integral with the upper surface of the shearing member&#39;5 and serves to guide the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> locking member or plate 15</span> when the latter is moved to operative and inoperative position.   </p>

                        <p>   In order to use the shears it is merely necessary to adjust the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> locking plate 15</span> longitudinally of the shears until the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> opening 18</span> registers with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> pin 20</span> when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> spring 27</span> will force the shearing members apart and thus permit the same to be used by exerting a lateral pressure on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> flanges 8</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The piercing member or point may be used by moving the same to the dotted line position shown in Fig. 2 of the drawings or by further rotating the same until the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> point 17</span> is in alinement with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> point 14</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> knife 12</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In order to lock the several parts in closed or inoperative position it is merely necessary to slide the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> plate 15</span> longitudinally of the shearing members until the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> end wall 33</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> slot 18</span> bears against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> pin 20</span> and in which position the guard covers the cutting edges of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> knife 12</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> adjacent lip 19</span> by engagement with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> pin 20</span> looks the shearing members against lateral movement.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It will b noted that the adjacent ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> arms 11</span> constituting the tweezers are normally spaced apart so that said tweezers may be employed for removing hairs and the like fromthe skin without the necessity of first releasing the locking member.   </p>
