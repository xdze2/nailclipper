E. McNeil Assistant Examiner-Gregory E; McNeill Attorney, Agent, or FirmKinzer, Plyer, Dorn &amp; McEachran [5 7 ABSTRACT A finger nail clipper in which from or side guards, or both, are attached to protect the user from cutting the soft skin of his fingers or toes; the guards include an adjustably mounted curved front guard, attached to the lower clipper jaw, which butts against the skin under the finger nail or toe nail to assure uniformly trimmed nails, and a side guard which is affixed to at least one side of the cutting element of one jaw member and projects alongside the cutting element of the other jaw member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  5 Claims, 6 Drawing Figures GUARDEI) FINGER NAIL CLIPPERS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to finger nail clippers and more particularly concerns guarded finger nail clippers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   One problem found in cutting finger nails and especially toe nails is that of the skin getting in the way of the cutting edges and consequently being cut. Consequently, it is desirable to guard the skin from being cut by making it difficult for the cutting edge of the clipper to enclose surrounding soft skin.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another problem in conventional finger nail clippers is that when a person who is normally right handed or left handed has to cut the finger nails on his right or left hand respectively, it is very difficult to align the clippers and cut while holding the clippers in his opposite hand. Consequently, it is desirable to have a guard which guides the clippers so that each nail will be cut a uniform length from the tip of the finger.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Thus, it is the object of this invention to provide a nail clipper with an adjustable guide to assure uniform clipping.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object of this invention is to provide a nail clipper with side guards to protect against cutting of soft skin alongside the nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Accordingly, the nail clipper of the present invention includes: an elongated upper jaw member having a downwardly directed cutting element at one end, an elongated lower jaw member having an upwardly directed cutting element at one end, securing means attaching the jaw members to each other at the ends opposite the cutting elements, with the free cutting element ends of the jaw members flexibly biased apart to separate the cutting elements from each other, and cam means for driving the free ends of the jaw members toward each other to close the cutting edges thereof on each other and sever a nail positioned between the cutting edges. A front guard member is mounted on and projects outwardly of the free end of one of the jaw members closely adjacent the cutting element of that jaw member, and an adjustable mounting means is attached to the one jaw member to mount the guard member on the jaw, allowing adjustment of the length of projection of the front guard member outwardly of its associated cutting member to control the depth of the nail cut to suit the needs of the user. Another embodiment of the present invention includes at least one side guard element affixed to the side of the free end of one jaw member and projecting alongside the cutting element of the other jaw member, for precluding cutting of the users skin during severing of a nail.   </p>

                        <p>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION FIG. 1 is a side view of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> which includes an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> elongated upper jaw member 11</span> having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> downwardly directed cutting element 12</span> at one end and an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> alongated lower jaw member 13</span> having an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> upwardly directed cutting element 14</span> at one end. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> two ja<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">w members 11 and 13</span></span> are connected, by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> securing means 15</span>, at the ends of the jaw members opposite the cutting elements, so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">g elements 12 and 14</span></span> at the free ends of the jaw members are flexibly biased apart to separate the cutting elements from each other.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Clipper 10</span> includes a cam means for driving the free ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaw me<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">mbers 11 and 13</span></span> toward each other to close the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">g elements 12 and 14</span></span> on each other and sever a nail positioned between the cutting edges. This cam means includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> post 16</span> which extends through holes 11a and 13a in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaw me<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">mbers 11 and 13</span></span> respectively. The post includes a head 16a which is larger in diameter than the hole 13a so that the post will be firmly stopped against the outer surface of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> jaw member 13</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> post 16</span> also includes a notch 16b which pivotly mounts a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> movable handle 18</span>. The combined post and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> handle 18</span> are larger than the diameter of the hole 11a and firmly stopped against the outer surface of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaw member 11</span> so as to attach the post and handle to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> elonga<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">ted jaw members 11 and 13</span></span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> handle 18</span> includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> cam 19</span> which extends from the handle in a direction toward the upper elongated jaw. When the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> handle 18</span> is pushed in the direction of arrow A, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> cam 19<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"></span><span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> drives jaw members 11 and 13</span></span> together so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">g elements 12 and 14</span></span> mounted on the free ends of the jaw members close on each other to sever material placed between the cutting elements.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> front guard member 20</span> is mounted so that it projects outward from the free end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> lower jaw member 13</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> guard member 20</span> is adjustably mounted on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> jaw member 13</span> by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> hold-down clamp 22</span> having a threaded projection 22a which extends through an opening 13b in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> lower jaw member 13</span>. The hold-down clamp is firmly attached with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> retainer 21</span> which screws onto the threated projection 22a of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> hold down clamp 22</span> so as to firmly clamp the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> front guard member 20</span> in place.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 2 is a sectional plan view taken along line 2--2 of FIG. 1, showing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> lower jaw member 13</span>, a section of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> securing means 15</span>, and a section of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> post 16</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> front guard member 20</span> has a curved surface 20a which is shaped to buttagainst the skin of the finger tip when the nail clipper is used. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> front guard member 20</span> also has two prongs 20b and 20c which extend through complimentary openings in the lower jaw member. The prongs can slide freely in and out of these openings as indicated by arrow B. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> hold-down clamp 22</span> projects over each of the prongs 20a and 20b, and when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> retainer 21</span> is firmly screwed on the threaded projection 22a of the hold-down clamp, the prongs 20b and 200 are securly clamped between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> hold-down clamp 22</span> and the upper surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> lower jaw member 13</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 3 shows a partial exploded perspective view of the clamping means used for adjustable mounting of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> guard member 20</span>. As seen therein, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> front guard member 20</span> can be inserted into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> openin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">gs 23 and 24</span></span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> lower jaw member 13</span>. Also shown in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> hold-down clamp 22</span> and its threaded projection 22a. When assembled, the prongs 20b and 20c of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> front guard element 20</span> pass through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> openin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">gs 24 and 23</span></span>, respectively, and extend past the opening 13b in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> lower jaw lever 13</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> hold down clamp 22</span> is then placed so that the projection 22a passes through opening 13b, and the underside of the hold-down clamp is positioned with recesses 22b and 220 adjacent to the prongs 20b and 20c of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> front guard element 20</span>, respectively. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> retainer 21</span> is then screwed on the threaded projection 22a to clamp the prongs 20b and 200 of the front guard member tightly between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> hold-down clamp 22</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> jaw element 13</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 4 is a plan view of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> nail clipper 25</span> with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> elongated upper jaw member 26</span> and an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> elongated lower jaw member 27</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> Securing means 28</span> attaches the ends of the jaw members opposite the cutting elements firmly together so that the cutting elements on the free ends of the jaw members are flexibly biased apart. Also shown is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> mounting post 29</span> on which a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> handle 30</span>, with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> cam 31</span>, is pivotally mounted so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> jaw me<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">mbers 26 and 27</span></span> can be driven to close the cutting edges on the free ends of the jaw elements and sever material placed between the cutting edges.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> Side g<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">uard elements 34 and 35</span></span> are affixed to the opposite sides of the free end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> jaw member 27</span> and project alongside the opposite sides 32a and 32b of the upper jaw cutting element. These<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> side g<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">uard members 34 and 35</span></span> push back the skin around the sides of the nails, thus precluding the cutting of the users skin during the severing of a nail.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> Openin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">gs 36 and 37</span></span> separate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> upper jaw element 26</span> from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> lower jaw element 27</span> so that material cannot be out between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> side g<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">uard elements 34 and 35</span></span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> upper jaw element 26</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. is an end view of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> clipper 25</span>, showing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">g elements 32 and 33</span></span> at the ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> elonga<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">ted jaws 26 and 27</span></span>, respectively. A partial view of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> handle 30</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> post 29</span> are shown. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> side g<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">uards 34 and 35</span></span> and sides 32a and 32b of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> upper cutting element 32</span> are also shown. In this embodiment the cam, handle, and post work similarly to that described in FIGS. 1 and 2.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 6 shows another embodiment of the invention utilizing a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> side guard 38</span> on only one side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39"> lower jaw 39</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">g elements 40 and 41</span></span> extend to the outer edge of the jaws as shown in 40a and 41a opposite the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> side guard 38</span> and the indentation for the side guard 38a. Thus, one can use the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> side guard 38</span> to push back the skin on one side of the finger to clip a nail and then turn the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180"> clippers 180</span> and use the side guard to push back the skin on the other side of the finger nail. In all instances when references to cutting a finger nail is made, it also includes cutting a toe nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It will be apparent from the foregoing that a combination nail cutter including the features of both embodiments of the present invention may also be constructed. Thus, a finger nail clipper can have both an adjustable front guard for guiding the depth of the cut, and either a single or double side guard to protect the skin from being cut. Accordingly, it is intended that any combinations of the single or double side guard and the adjustable front guard are within the scope of the invention.   </p>
