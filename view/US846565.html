                        <p>  T0 /LZZ whom, t may concern.-   </p>
                    
                        <p>   -Be it known that l, GEORGE HAvELL, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Newark, in the county of Essex and State `of New Jersey, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Nail-Clippers, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention relates to nail-clippers, and consists inthe mechanism and arrangement of parts hereinafter described and claimed.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The object of the invention is to provide a compact and durable nail-clipper, the parts of which are easy to manufacture and assemble.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the drawings, Figure 1 is a vertical medial section through a nail-clipper embodying this invention. Figs. 2, 3, and 4 are perspective views of parts of the nail-clipper; and Fig. 5 is avertical medial section through a nail clipper embodying this invention, showing the parts in the open position ready to be operated for clipping purposes.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This nail-clipper is composed of two jaws, movable toward and from each other by means of a lever. The said jaws are fastened rigidly together at one end and at the other are formed into a cutter, which in the present instance consists of a cutting-blade acting against a seat. l   </p>
                    
                        <p>   One of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> cutting-jaws 1</span> has upon it a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> curved seat 2</span> and is provided with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> integral bearing-plate 3</span>, which in the present case terminates in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> hook 4</span>. The bearing plate and hook are formed, as clearly shown in Fig. 4, from a tongue which is punched from the body of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> jaw 1</span> The end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> jaw or member 1</span>` opposite the end having the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> seat 2</span> is preferably bent out of the plane of the main portion of the body and is perfo# rated, as at 5, near that end, for apurpose to be described. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> said member 1</span> is also perforated, as at 6, leaving in the center of the perforation a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> bar 7</span>, which may be rounded. f   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> other member or jaw 8</span> (shown most clearly in Fig. 3) is formed of a material which can be tempered, and has at one end a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> downwardly-turned sharp edge 9</span>, adapted to cooperate with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> seat 2</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> jawor member 1</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> foration 10</span>, adapted to register with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> per- &#39;foration 5</span> in the other member, an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">da screwrivet or other suitable fastening 11</span> passes The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> jaw 8</span> at its other end has a per-l other perforations, one of which, 12, is f adapted to permit the passage of the tongue and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> hook 3</span> and-4, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> other perforation 13</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> downwardly-turned tongue 14</span>, for purposes hereinafter to be` described. To the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> transverse bar 7</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> Opening 6</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> member or jaw 1</span> is attached a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> swinging hook 15</span>, which projects upward through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> per foration 13</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> jaw or member 8</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> tongue 14</span> is in such a position and is at such an angle to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> body ofthe member 8</span> that in the movement of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> jaw 8</span> with reference to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> jaw 1</span> the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> hook 15</span> will slide along the surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> tongue 14</span> without engaging it. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> tongue 14</span> also when the parts are closed, as shown in Fig. 1, for cutting purposes may bear against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> member 1</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The member has on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> its upper surface two longitudinal ribs 16</span>, preferably near the side edges of the member and on opposite sides of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> perforation 12</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The two members or cutting-jaws above described are operated by means of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> lever 17</span>, (shown most clearly in Fig. 2,) which at its free end is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> point 18</span> suitable kfor use as a nail-cleaner. Adjacent to the free end is an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> opening 19</span>, through which the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> hook 15</span> passes when the parts are in the closed position shown in Fig. 1, and on the upper surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> lever <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">1,7</span></span> and adjacent to the edge of the perforation .19 may be a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> socket 20</span>, into which the edge of said<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> hook 15</span> may set, as shown in Fig. 1, for the more certain securing of the parts in position. The other end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> lever 17</span> is bent downward into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> U-shaped portion 21</span> and has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> perforation 22</span> for the passage of the tongue and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> hook 3<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> and 4</span></span>, so that a cross bar or part 23, at or near the extremity of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> lever 17</span> and on one side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> Ushaped portion 21</span>,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  may engage under the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> hook 4</span> of the tongue IOO tension of the two jaws causes the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> portion 23</span> to press close upon the upper face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> member 8</span>, and thus leaves the free `end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> lever 17</span> away from the remainder of the clipper, as shown in Fig. 5. If now the nail is inserted between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">g-jaws 9 and 2</span></span> and the free end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> lever 17</span> is depressed, the cutting-jaws will be brought together with great force, because the fulcrum of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> lever 17</span> (at the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> U-shaped portion 21</span>) presses against and slides along the member S, and   </p>
                    
                        <p>  the cutting operation will be produced with great force. On releasing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> lever 17</span> the parts will open to the position shown in Fig. 5. When the device is to be carried in a pocket, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> hook 15</span> is so tilted that when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> lever 17</span> is brought to the position shown in Fig. 1 the said hook will pass through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> opening 19</span>, when it may be caused to engage said lever. If the edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> hook 15</span> is set in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> notch 20</span>, the spring-pressure of the parts will hold the hook in position and retain the nail-clipper with the parts in the position shown in Fig. 1.   </p>
