                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates to TOE NAIL CLIPPERS and more particularly pertains to a new Long Handle Toenail Clippers for ALLOWING A PERSON TO CUT THEIR TOENAILS WITHOUT NEEDING TO BEND OVER.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Description of the Prior Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The use of TOE NAIL CLIPPERS is known in the prior art. More specifically, TOE NAIL CLIPPERS heretofore devised and utilized are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Known prior art TOE NAIL CLIPPERS include U.S. Pat. No. 4,893,406 to Larson; U.S. Pat. No. 5,357,677 to West; U.S. Pat. No. Des. 329,306 to Rommerdale; U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,449 to Lee et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,564,034 to Mackel; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,847,994 to Dunn, Jr.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objectives and requirements, the aforementioned patents do not disclose a new Long Handle Toenail Clippers. The inventive device includes a conventional nail clipper having a cutting portion and an actuating lever. A triangular base is positioned below and is secured to a lower segment of the cutting portion. The triangular base orients the nail clipper with a forward end of the nail clipper disposed below a rearward end of the nail clipper. A telescopic handle is coupled to the actuating lever of the nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In these respects, the Long Handle Toenail Clippers according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of ALLOWING A PERSON TO CUT THEIR TOENAILS WITHOUT NEEDING TO BEND OVER.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of TOE NAIL CLIPPERS now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new Long Handle Toenail Clippers construction wherein the same can be utilized for ALLOWING A PERSON TO CUT THEIR TOENAILS WITHOUT NEEDING TO BEND OVER.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new Long Handle Toenail Clippers apparatus and method which has many of the advantages of the TOE NAIL CLIPPERS mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new Long Handle Toenail Clippers which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art TOE NAIL CLIPPERS, either alone or in any combination thereof.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To attain this, the present invention generally comprises a conventional nail clipper having a cutting portion and an actuating lever. A triangular base is positioned below and securing to a lower segment of the cutting portion. The triangular base orients the nail clipper with a forward end of the nail clipper disposed below a rearward end of the nail clipper. A telescopic handle is coupled to the actuating lever of the nail clipper. The telescopic handle has an upper portion, an intermediate portion and a lower portion. The lower portion is pivotally coupled with the actuating lever of the nail clipper. A locking knob extends through the lower portion and the actuating lever for selectively locking the lower portion with respect to the actuating lever to preclude pivotal rotation. A magnifying lens is coupled with respect to the lower portion of the telescopic handle disposed above the nail clipper. The magnifying lens has a bifurcated outer end portion slidably receiving the lower portion of the telescopic handle therein. A locking knob extends through the bifurcated outer end portion for selectively locking the magnifying lens with respect to the lower portion to preclude sliding of the lens.  </p>

The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> triangular base 18</span> orients the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> nail clipper 12</span> with a forward end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> nail clipper 12</span> disposed below a rearward end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> nail clipper 12</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> telescopic handle 20</span> is coupled to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> actuating lever 16</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> nail clipper 12</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> telescopic handle 20</span> has an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> upper portion 22</span>, an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> intermediate portion 24</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> lower portion 26</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> lower portion 26</span> is pivotally coupled with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> actuating lever 16</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> nail clipper 12</span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> locking knob 28</span> extends through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> lower portion 26</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> actuating lever 16</span> for selectively locking the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> lower portion 26</span> with respect to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> actuating lever 16</span> to preclude pivotal rotation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> magnifying lens 30</span> is coupled with respect to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> lower portion 26</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> telescopic handle 20</span> disposed above the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> nail clipper 12</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> magnifying lens 30</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> bifurcated outer end portion 32</span> slidably receiving the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> lower portion 26</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> telescopic handle 20</span> therein. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> locking knob 34</span> extends through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> bifurcated outer end portion 32</span> for selectively locking the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> magnifying lens 30</span> with respect to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> lower portion 26</span> to preclude sliding of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> lens 30</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In use, a user simply places their toe onto the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> triangular base 18</span> and positions their nail in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> nail clipper 12</span>. With the use of the hand, the user would press down on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> telescopic handle 20</span> which will pressure the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> actuating lever 16</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> nail clipper 12</span> thereby cutting the nail. With the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> magnifying lens 30</span> positioned above the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> nail clipper 12</span>, the user is better able to visualize the toe nail to be clipped. The user can adjust the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> magnifying lens 30</span> up or down to focus the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> lens 30</span> on the toenail being clipped. Additionally, the user can adjust the angle of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> telescopic handle 20</span> with respect to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> nail clipper 12</span> simply by loosening the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> locking knob 28</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As to a further discussion of the manner of usage and operation of the present invention, the same should be apparent from the above description. Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the manner of usage and operation will be provided.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention. </p>
