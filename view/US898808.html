                        <p>  Application filed August 23, 1907. Serial No. 389,763.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, HENRY WILooX, a citizen of the United States, residing at Newark, 1n the county of Essex and State of New J ersey, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in NailClippers; and I do hereby declare the followlng to be a full, clear, and exact description of the invention, such as will enable others skilled in the art to which it appertains to make and use the same, reference being had to the accompanylng drawings, and to figures of reference marked thereon, which form a part of this specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention relates to a nail clipper comprising a pair of cutter-blades pivotally mounted on a pin and having rearwardly proj ecting spring tongues, combined with a pair of levers pivoted intermediate of their ends on the pin, one end of each lever forming a handle portion, and each handle portion engaging the spring tongue of a cutter-blade, the projecting end of each lever engaging the outside of the cutter-blade, other than the blade engaged by its handle portion. The levers thus operate on one side of the pivot to force the cutting edges of the cutter-blades together, and are in turn operated by the spring tongues of the cutter-blades to be normally slightly apart.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The invention also provides a locking means, on the ends of the handle portions of the levers, to hold the handles together.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another new feature of the invention is the arrangement of parts that permits the levers to be swung until they are in line, to   </p>
                    
                        <p>  &#39; form a comparatively long handle portion to be grasped by the hand when the nail cleaner, on the projecting end of one of the .handle portions, is used.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawing, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of the parts of the clipper when separated. Fig. 2 is a central longitudinal section of the clipper assembled. Fig. 3 is atop view of the clipper, and Fig. 4 is a front view of the same.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The clipper is composed of two levers, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> lower one 10</span>, and an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> upper one 11</span>, which are pivoted near one end on a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> pin 12</span>. The levers form, on their longest projecting parts, handle portions and are substantially U- shaped in cross-section, this form being preferred on account of the stiffness it imparts, but the contour and form of the handle portions can be changed. The levers are provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> cheek-pieces 15</span>, spaced apart transversely, which are perforated at 13 to receive the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> pin 12</span>. The short end of each lever is formed into a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> finger or hook 14</span> to engage the outside of the cutterblades. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cutterblades 16</span> have the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> ears 17</span> which are perforated at 18 so that the cutter-blades can be pivoted on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> pin 12</span> and on the outside of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> levers<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> 10 and 11</span></span>. Each cutter-blade is notched at 19 to form the central and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> rearwardly extending tongue 20</span>, and also to allow&#39; the passage of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> cheek-pieces 15</span> of the levers. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> tongues 20</span>, of the cutter-blades, project rearwardly beyond the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> pivotal pin 12</span>, the one on the upper cutter-blade being adapted to be engaged by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> transverse bearing surface 21</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> lever 11</span>, and the one on the lower blade being adapted to be engaged by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> bearing surface 22</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> lever 10</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The top and bottomof the assembled cutter-blades are engaged by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> fingers 1</span> 1, and when the handle portions of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> levers<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> 10 and 11</span></span> are operated, the opposed cutting edgesof the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> blades 16</span> are brought together. hen the pressure on the handle portions is removed, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> spring tongues 20</span> act to force the handle portions of the levers apart, assisted by the tendency of the cutting edges to separate on account of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> blades 16</span> being themselves made of spring metal. These spring tongues act to normally hold the handle portions of the levers slightly apart, and consequently the cutting edges of the cutterblades are open for the reception of the article to be out. The levers are preferably sup plied with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> file-t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">eeth 23 and 24</span></span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> lever 10</span> is narrowed and bent up to form a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> standard 26</span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> screw 27</span> is arranged in a screw-threaded perforation in the standard, and is rigidly secured to a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> cylindrical hood 28</span>. When the handle portions are brought close together, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> hood 28</span> can be screwed up to engage the end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> nail cleaner 25</span>, which is on the end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> lever 11</span>, and thus lock the parts together.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> lever 10</span> has<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> recesses 29</span> therein to allow the passage of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> cheek-pieces 15</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> lever 11</span>, as the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> lever 11</span> is the narrowest, as will be seen from Fig. 4. This construction permits the spreading of the levers until they are in line, so as to furnish a good grip when the nail cleaner is used, as a comparatively long handle is the result.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having thus described my invention,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> what I claim is: I I p 1</span>.
