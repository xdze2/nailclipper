                        <p>  Application filed March 22, 1922. Serial No. 545,835.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom 5t may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be. it known that I, Fnnnnm&#39;on LOBL, a citizen of the United States, and resident ot lviddleboro, county of Plymouth, and Commonwealth ot hlassachusetts, have invented an Improvement in Nail Clippers, of which the following description, in connection with the accompanying drawings, is a specitication, like characters on the drawings representing like parts.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention relates to nail clippers and its object is to provide a novel device of that nature that may be carried conveniently in the pocket or pocketbook.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the drawings of one embodiment of my invention illustrated and described herein Fig. l is a front edge view;   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Fig. 2, a plan;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 3, a vertical&#39;section on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> line 3</span> Fi .2.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   4, a plan of a modified form ot construction;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 5, a vertical section on the line 5-5 Fig. 4c.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 6, a plan of a further modification; and   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FiO. Figi.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring first to Figs. l, 2, 8, my novel cutter comprises a sheet of suitable material as metal bent or folded along one edge l to form two wings, 2, 3, of any convenient size and outline. This metal is preferably of the resilient kind so that the wings may be pressed toward each other and will thus automatically separate and return to their Original and normal positions.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   To provide the required cutting members, Figs. l, 2, the edge l is cut away, a portion of its length, and the central part ot the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> recessed edge 4</span> on each wing, Fig. l, is inwardly turned, tempered and sharpened forming the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> jaws 5<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">, 6</span></span>, with cutting edges i&#39;, 8, thereon. Obviously by compressing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> wings <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">2, 3</span></span>, toward each other, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">g edges 7, 8</span></span>, will be caused to clip the nail end between them.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In Figs. 4i, 5, a modification is disclosed wherein the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> jaws 5<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">, 6</span></span>, and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">g edges 7, 8</span></span>, are formed from a piece of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> metal 9</span> riveted or otherwise secured to the wings l, 2.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  7, a vertical section on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> line 7</span> 7,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  are formed of separate members which are Y hinged at l() along their front edges adjacent the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> cutter<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">s 7, 8</span></span>. A spring il may beV provided if desired to separate the&#39;yarns.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In Figs. 6, 7, the wings are provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> spring or resilient tongue member 12</span> struck up from one of the wings and caused to seat at one end against the opposite wing.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Obviously my invention is not restricted to the particular embodiment thereof herein illustrated, but is more particularly pointed out in the following claims:   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Claims.   </p>

                        <p>   3. A nail clipper comprising a lower wing, an upper wing integral therewith, and cutting edges on the wings between&#39;but out of alignment with the connecting portions of the wings. f  <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> </p>
                    
                        <p>   4</span>. A nail clipper comprising two opposed wings having one common edge, and a portion ot this edge cut away to t&#39;orm opposed cutting edges between but without the vertical plane of the connecting portions of the wings.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   5.
