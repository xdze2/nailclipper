                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates to a combined nail clipper and key holder and more particularly, to a nail clipper container pivotably housing a nail clipper therein for readily carrying and easily erecting the nail clipper from the nail clipper container.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Description of the Prior Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Previously, several types of key holders and nail clippers have been separately developed. However, these key holders and nail clippers suffer from a number of difficulties since separate key holders and nail clippers require separate purchases which are expensive, and such separate items occupy a large amount of space in a pocket, a hand bag, or the like. Further, the unavailability of a nail clipper is frequently experienced when traveling.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a combined nail clipper and key holder which makes readily available the nail clipper for frequent use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Another object of the present invention is to provide a key holder panel having a hollow portion therein for pivotably housing a nail clipper which can be rotated from the housing for instant use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A further object of the present invention is to provide a nail clipper container including a key ring for carrying keys and a hollow portion disposed therein defined by a pair of grooves provided on both walls of the hollow portion thereof for slidably locking the nail clipper within the hollow portion through the use of a pair of locking pins expended from the middle portion of an outer cutting jaw member of the nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Other objects and further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Briefly described, the present invention relates to a combined nail clipper and key holder which comprises a nail clipper container, key holder, including hollow portion with a pair of grooves and an aperture disposed at the rear end portion thereof, and a nail clipper having a pair of locking pins for slidably engaging a pair of grooves and an eyelet and a pin for pivotably connecting the nail clipper to the key holder so that the nail clipper can be easily detached from or attached to the nail clipper container.  </p>

                        <p>      DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now in detail to the drawings for the purpose of illustrating the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the combined nail clipper and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> key holder 10</span> as shown in FIGS. 1, 2, and 3 comprises a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> nail clipper 13</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> nail clipper container 11</span> including a hollow portion disposed therein for pivotably receiving the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> nail clipper 13</span>, and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> key ring 15</span> pivotably connected to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> nail clipper contai<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">ner 11</span> for pivotably holding keys 16</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> nail clipper 13</span> includes an outer cutting jaw member 23a, an inner cutting jaw member 23b, an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> actuating lever 27</span>, a file member, an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> eyelet 26</span>, and a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> locking pins 18</span> which extend from the middle portion of the outer cutting jaw member 23a.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> nail clipper container 11</span> further includes an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> aperture 17</span>, disposed at the rear end thereof, having an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> enlarged portion 22</span> disposed at the outside portion thereof for slidably and rotatably receiving a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> pin 20</span> having an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> enlarged portion 21</span> disposed at the outside portion thereof for mounting the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> nail clipper 13</span> to the nail clipper container (FIG. 5). Since the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> enlarged portion 22</span> has plastic walls, it will be formed to expand slightly to receive the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> rigid portion 21</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As shown in FIG. 4, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> hollow portion 12</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> nail clipper container 11</span> includes a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> locking grooves 19</span> on both walls thereof for slidably receiving the pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> locking pins 18</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> nail clipper 13</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> grooves 19</span> are<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> slightly smaller than locking pins 18</span> so that a function fit is established when the pins are forced into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> grooves 19</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In assembly, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> nail clipper con<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">tainer 11</span> pivotably containing key 16</span> through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> connecting member 14</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> key ring 15</span> is assembled with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> nail clipper 13</span> by inserting the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> pin 20</span> into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> aperture 17</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> nail clipper container 11</span> through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> eyelet 26</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> nail clipper 13</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In operation, when the user desires to use the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> nail clipper 11</span> from the combined nail clipper and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> key holder 10</span> according to the present invention, the finger is inserted into a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> space 27</span> in the vicinity of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> cutting jaws 23</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> nail clipper 13</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> nail clipper 13</span> is pulled out in the direction indicated by the arrow from the housed position shown in FIG. 2 to the erected position shown in FIG. 3.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included in the scope of the following claims. </p>
