                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A cuticle cutter of the like is described which is of the scissors type. Instruments of this type, especially in beauty salons, require constant cleaning, sharpening and sterilisation. The cutter of the invention facilitates such procedures by permitting the handles ( 2,21 ) to be separate from the blades ( 1, 1 â€²). In the preferred embodiment the blades are snap fitted into the handles and the arrangement is such that on opening the cutters to a maximum surfaces on the handles enter into abutment with the blades in the region of the pivot ( 6 ) and further opening cams the blades away from the handles, releasing them without any necessity for manual contact. The blades can then be submitted to the above mentioned procedures and stored for further use. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> [0001]     The present invention refers to a cuticle cutter of the scissors type.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        STATE OF THE ART   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]     Conventional cuticle cutters of the scissors type are presented to the user as undismountable relatively small instruments and when it is necessary to sharpen the cutter blades or carry out any other form of maintenance, which is relatively common, it is necessary to send them to a qualified professional, which is expensive and time consuming, or merely throw them away and buy a new device. This is obviously a disadvantage.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]     In addition, in beauty salons it is necessary to carry out complete cleaning and/or sterilisation of the cutters between use and this with time damages the handle parts of the devices. Since the cutter blades and not the handles enter into contact with the customer (user), such deep cleaning or sterilisation of the handles is not necessary.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]     Also in beauty salons, storage of cutters as complete instruments is difficult due to their complicated shape and there is a considerable risk that the cutting edges become damaged and/or that the handles themselves, especially when made of plastic material, may be damaged by the cutter blades. In addition to this, if the cutting edges are damages or worn beyond recuperation, the whole instrument has to be thrown away even though the handles might still be in a perfect state.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0005]     According to the present invention the above problems can be entirely overcome by means of a scissors-type cuticle cutter or the like comprising a first cutter blade and handle combination pivoted to a second cutter blade and handle combination by means of a pivot element, in which the cutter blade and the handle of each combination are releasably attached to each other.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]     In the presently preferred embodiment of the invention in which each cutter blade consists of a cutting end, a central pivot portion through which said pivot element passes and a spigot, each handle is formed with a substantially longitudinal passage into which the spigot of the associated cutter blade is received and resilient releasable attachment means are provided to maintain the spigot in the passage.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]     It is preferred that each attachment means comprises a spring element formed with a protuberance mounted laterally in said passage and a lateral recess formed in the spigot of the respective cutter blade. The lateral recess receives the protuberance to maintain the cuticle cutter in a mounted configuration and the spring element may be flexed to permit separation of the cutter blade from the handle on the application of a longitudinal separating force between the handle and the cutter blade.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]     It is particularly desirable that the separation of the blades from the handles is effected simply and safely. In the preferred embodiment each said handle has an axially extending outer portion which, in the mounted configuration of the cuticle cutter, extends as far as said central pivot portions of the cutter blades. With this arrangement, on opening the cutter to a maximum extent, a laterally outer surface of each cutter blade may engage an inner surface of the axially extending outer portion of the handle associated with the other cutter blade to produce the longitudinal separating force between the blades and their associated handles.  </p>
                    
                        <p>       </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0009]     The present invention will be better understood from the following specific description, given by way of example, of the presently preferred embodiment, reference being made to the accompanying drawings, in which:   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]      FIG. 1  is a side view of the presently preferred embodiment of a cuticle cutter according to the present invention, with the cutter in a cutting position (half open) and with the handles in longitudinal section so as to permit visualisation of the interconnection between the blades and the handles;   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]      FIG. 2  is a view similar to that of  FIG. 1 , but with the cutter fully open to a point where separation of the blades from the handles is effected; and   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]      FIG. 3  is a view of the blades pivoted to each other, after removal.  </p>
                    
                        <p>       </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0013]     Referring now to the drawings,  FIG. 1  shows a view of the preferred embodiment of a cuticle cutter in accordance with the present invention. As can be seen, the cutter comprises two blade-handle comb<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">inations comprising metal cutter blades  1</span>  and  1 â€² and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">plastic handles  2</span>  and  2 â€². <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">Cutter blade  1</span>  comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">blade end  3</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pivot portion  4</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">spigot  5</span> . Similarly, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">cutter blade  1</span> â€² comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">blade end  3</span> â€², a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pivot portion  4</span> â€² and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">spigot  5</span> â€². The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pivot portions  4</span>  and  4 â€² of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">blades  1</span>  and  1 â€² are pivoted by means of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">pivot element  6</span>  in the form of a screw or rivet. It will be observed that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">each sp<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">igot  5</span>  or  5</span> â€² is formed with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">lateral<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> semicircular recess  7</span>  or  7</span> â€². <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0014]     Handles  2</span>  and  2 â€² are formed with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">longitudinal passageways  8</span>  and  8 â€² that are adapted to receive the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">spigot or handle ends  5</span>  and  5 â€² of the blades. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">Each ha<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ndle  2</span>  or  2</span> â€² has a lateral opening providing access to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">respect<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">ive passageway  8</span>  or  8</span> â€² and is provided with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">shaped <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">plug  9</span>  or  9</span> â€² so that in normal use the plug can be snap fitted into and to close the opening. Each handle is also provided with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">spring <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">element  10</span>  or  10</span> â€² designed to fit into the cavity formed in the lateral opening. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">spring elements  10</span>  and  10 â€² are basically flat strips of spring metal or the lake with a respective semicircular protuberances corresponding to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">recesses  7</span>  and  7 â€² in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">blade spigots  5</span>  and  5 â€². <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0015] <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">    Each handle  2</span>  or  2</span> â€² at its blade end is provided with an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">inwar<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">dly inclined end surface  11</span>  or  11</span> â€², the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">passage<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">way  8</span>  or  8</span> â€² being bored into such surface. The laterally outer side of the blade end of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">each ha<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ndle  2</span>  or  2</span> â€², however, is formed with an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">extensi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">on  12</span>  or  12</span> â€² that, in the assembled configuration of the cutter as shown in  FIG. 1 , extends to a point approximately opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">pivot element  6</span>  of the blades.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0016]     In order to effect initial assembly of the cuticle cutter shown in  FIG. 1 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">spring elements  10</span>  and  10 â€² are placed in the cavities formed behind the lateral openings in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">handles  2</span>  and  2 â€², after which the plug elements are snapped into place. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">handles  2</span>  and  2 â€² are then fitted to the blade arrangement (see  FIG. 3 ) by inserting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">spigots  5</span>  and  5 â€² into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">respective passageways  8</span>  and  8 â€² and manually pressuring them longitudinally until the semicircular protuberances of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">spring elements  10</span>  and  10 â€² enter the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">lateral recesses  7</span>  and  7 â€² in the spigots, firmly retaining them in place.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0017]     The cuticle cutter can then be used normally, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">conventional spring element  13</span>  mounted on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">handle  2</span>  providing resistance during trimming.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0018]     When it is desired to clean the blades, between users, it is sufficient to open the cutters to the maximum (see  FIG. 2 ) until the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">extensions  12</span>  and  12 â€² abut the laterally outer sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pivot portions  4</span>  of the blades. Further forcible opening of the cutter results in a longitudinal separating force being applied to the blades with the result that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">spigots  5</span>  and  5 â€² are pulled outwardly until engagement between the semicircular protuberances of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">spring elements  10</span>  and  10 â€² and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">recesses  7</span>  and  7 â€² is lost. The blades can then be easily removed without any manual force and submitted to sterilisation and/or sharpening procedures. They can then be stored prior to further use.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]     It should be noted that no manual contact with the blades is necessary in order to release them from the handles, physical contact only being required to remove then to the location where they are to be cleaned or sterilised. Alternatively, if the blades are too worn or damaged for further use, they may be substituted for new ones without having also to throw away the respective handles. </p>
