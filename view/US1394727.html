                        <p>   In ventor: Christ/an E. A .Gron bech y 9M K/ w Arty Patented Oct. 25, 1921,-   </p>
                    
                        <p>  CHRISTIAN E. A. GRONBECH, OF KEENE, NEW HAMPSHIRE.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  NAIL-CLIP.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To a/ll whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, CHRISTIAN E. A. GRoNBEoH, acitizen of the United States, residing at Keene,in.thecounty of Cheshire and State of New Hampshire, haveinvented certain new and useful Improvements in Nail-Clips, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention relates to improvements in the construction of nail clips and more particularly to a means whereby the several elements constituting the entire device may beheld against dislocation from one another. 7   </p>
                    
                        <p>   &#39;In the construction of nail clips of this character, heretofore, difficulties have always been encountered, chiefly affecting the v derangement of the finger lever which op erates or depresses the upper cutting jaw, and withthis faulty construction in view I have provided a means whereby the finger lever is held against possible dislocation, except when a deliberate effort is made to separate the several members.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Therefore, an object of thisinvention&#39;is to provide an efficiently operating device of this character, wherein the number of parts used is reduced to a minimum, thereby decreasing the cost of production and the liability of derangement.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The invention consists in the structural features and combinations of parts herein after fully described with reference to the accompanying drawing, wherein Figure 1 is a side elevational view of the improved nail clip, showing the finger lever in partially raised position and the cutting jaws parted. V   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 2 is a substantially longitudinal sectional view through the nail clip with the finger lever in itsdepressed position and the cutting jaws in contact with each other.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  &#39; Figs. 3, 4:, 5 and 6 are respectively perspective views.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring to the drawing, 10 and 11 denote the cutting elements of the instrument and 12 the finger lever, which are the principal parts of the nail clip comprising the invention. A pivoted clasp 13- carried by an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem141"> axle 141</span> completes the catalogue of parts which go to make up the completed instrument.   </p>

Its forward endis bent at substantially right angles indicated at 30 and is provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> transversely extending lugs 31</span> which are normally movable in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> slots 19</span> before referred to. The central point of the upturned edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> portion 30</span> is raised to provide a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> teat 32</span> which is movable in a path leading across the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> slot 29</span>. The opposite end of the finger lever may be terminated in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> point 33</span>, as   </p>
                    
                        <p>  shown, and grooved as at 3.4 to be engaged by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> clasp 13</span>. The undersurface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> finger lever 12</span> is preferably roughened (not shown) to provide a nail file which may be used in the usual manner.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> clasp 13</span> is hook shaped as at 35 to engage the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> groove 34</span> when the instrument is to be held in closed position, shown in Fig. 2. An<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> opening 36</span>. is also provided in a portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> clasp 13</span> into which a link of a chain may be attached.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In assembling the instrument the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> axle 14</span>.- and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> clasp 13</span> are pivoted in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> openings 21</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> portions 18</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> positive cutting member 11</span> is then inserted in its respective position between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> walls 16</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> member 10</span> and moved rearwardly until the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> bearing surfact 26</span> rests underneath the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> axle 14</span>:. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> finger lever 12</span> may then be installed by grasping the body of the latter with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> angular portion 30</span> extending upwardly and by moving it angularly to the right, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> right lug 31</span> may be inserted into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> slot 19</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> right extended portion 17</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> finger lever 12</span> may readily be moved to the left and its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> left lug 31</span> allowed to enter the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> left slot 19</span> through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> offset 20</span>. It will be apparentthat after the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> lugs 31</span> are inserted into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> slots 19</span> there will be no possible way of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> lever 12</span> becoming separated from the rest of the instrument.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In order to use the nail clip as a file the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> finger lever 12</span> has simply to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180"> be moved 180</span> degrees until the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> teat 32</span> seats in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> slot 29</span>, which will hold the lever from closin It will be understood that the invention is not strictly limited to the details of construction which have been particularly described, but that a reasonable range of equivalents is included in the invention, as is evidenced by the accompanying claims. It will be noted that the device described may be manufactured and assembled in an exceedingly simple and inexpensive manner, may readily be taken apart when desired, and will, when assembled be compact, efficient, and not readily deranged I claim 1.
