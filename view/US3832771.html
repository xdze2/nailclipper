[5<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">6] References Cited UNITED STATES PATENTS 7</span> Claims,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem83"> 7 Drawing Figures 716,876 12/1902 Dunn 83</span>/696 NAIL CLIPPER WITH MEANS TO ADJUST THE CURVATURE OF THE CLIPPER BLADES This invention relates to nail clippers and more specifically to a novel and improved clipper having a cutting edge of sufficient length to clip substantially the entire width of the nail and which edge is adjustable so that a range of curvatures is provided to meet the desires of the user. Furthermore, the cutting edge may be scalloped or formed with other ornamental configurations.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Known nail clippers are generally formed of two elongated elements secured one to the other and having cooperating cutting edges of fixed configurations. The cutting edges are also relatively short so that only a portion of a nail can be clipped in a single operation and care must be exercised by the user to be certain that all nails are formed with substantially uniform curvatures and lengths. This invention overcomes the disadvantages of known clippers and not only enables an entire nail to be clipped at one time, but also ensures uniformity of length and curvature of each nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object of the invention resides in the provision of a novel and improved nail clipper wherein the curvature of the jaws or cutting heads is adjustable to meet the desires of the user and wherein the jaws are readily interchangeable to provide jaws of different ranges of curvature and ornamental configuration.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Still, another object of the invention resides in the provision of a novel and improved nail clipper for precisely shaping finger and toe nails and which is arranged and constructed to enable precise positioning of the cutting edges relative to the fingers or toes so that the nails will be uniformly shaped.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The nail clipper in accordance with the invention includes upper and lower tapered channels, a pair of concave jaws or heads slidably mounted on said channels and carrying cutting edges, the jaws being formed of a resilient material so that the degree of concavity can be modified by moving the jaws relative to the channels.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The above and other objects and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description and accompanying drawings forming part of this application.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In the Drawings:   </p>

                        <p>   FIG. 4 is a fragmentary portion of the structure of FIG. 2 showing the cutting heads displaced to modify the curvature of the cutting edge,   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIGS. 5 and 6 are enlarged plan views of cutting heads showing different configurations to obtain different types of curvatures, and   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 7 shows one form of an ornamental cutting head configuration in accordance with the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The nail clipper in accordance with the invention utilizes concave cutting heads or jaws which are adjustable to modify the curvature thereof and of a length sufficient to cut substantially the entire nail and thereby greatly facilitates uniform shaping of nails. One embodiment of a clipper for effecting these ends is shown in the drawings though it will become evident that other structures may be utilized to achieve the same objectives within the scope of the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring now to the drawings, the clipper includes a pair of upper and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> lower <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">channel members 10 and 11</span></span> with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> legs 12</span> of the upper member extending downwardly and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> legs 13</span> of the lower member extending upwardly. Both sets of legs taper substantially uniformly inwardly to the rear and terminate in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> parall<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">el portions 12, 12</span></span>&#39; and 13, 13&#39; with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> portio<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ns 12, 12</span></span> overlapping the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> portions 13</span>&#39;, 13&#39;.

                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">g heads 16 and 17</span></span> are joined by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> U-shap<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">ed springs 18 and 19</span></span> which normally hold the cutting heads in spaced relationship as shown in FIGS. 1 and 3. More specifically, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cutting head 16</span> includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> concave portion 20</span> of resilient material and having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> sharp cutting edge 21</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> concave portion 20</span> is coupled to the upper legs of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> spring<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">s 18 and 19</span></span> by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> triangular portions 22</span> which are spaced apart a distance approximately equal to the spacing between the inner surfaces of the outer ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> legs 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">2, 12</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> channel 10</span> so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> triangular portions 22</span> will snugly fit the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> channel 10</span> with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> cutting edge 21</span> extending well below the edges of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> legs 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">2, 12</span></span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> cutting head 17</span> is arranged in a manner similar to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> head 16</span> except that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> cutting edge 24</span> on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> concave portion 23</span> extends upwardly and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> triangular portions 25</span> are coupled to the lower legs of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> spring<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">s 18 and 19</span></span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">g heads 16 and 17</span></span> are adjustably retained in position in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> hinged<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> channels 10 and 11</span></span> by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> yokelike member 26</span> having<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> slots 27</span> on the ends thereof for engaging the curved portions of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> spring<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">s 18 and 19</span></span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> threaded rod 32</span> is secured to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> member 26</span> and extends through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> cooper<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">ating openings 28 and 29</span></span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> end wa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">lls 30 and 31</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> channe<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">ls 10 and 11</span></span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> coiled spring 33</span> surrounds the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> rod 32</span> for urging the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> member 26</span> forwardly and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> nut 34</span> threadably engages the rod for adjusting the position of the cutting members rela tive to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> channe<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">ls 10 and 11</span></span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Operation of the clipper to open and close the cutting members is accomplished by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> handle or lever 35</span> having an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> opening 36</span> therein to provide a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37"> relatively narrow transverse portion 37</span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> pin 38</span> having an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39"> undercut slot 39</span> formed therein extends through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> aligne<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">d openings 40 and 41</span></span> in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> channe<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">ls 10 and 11</span></span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37"> transverse portion 37</span> engages the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39"> slot 39</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> pin 38</span> is retained in engagement with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> handle 35</span> by the action of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> spring<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">s 18 and 19</span></span> which urge the channel members outwardly. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> handle 35</span> has an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> elongated portion 42</span> inclined upwardly from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> channel 10</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43"> short portion 43</span> containing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> opening 36</span>. With this arrangement depression of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> handle portion 42</span> will force the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> channe<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">ls 10 and 11</span></span> together and close the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">g heads 16 and 17</span></span> to sever a nail disposed therebetween.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The clipper in accordance with the invention is intended to shape a finger or toe nail in one operation. Inasmuch as the nails have a natural curvature the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">g edges 21 and 24</span></span> have curvatures in the vertical plane as shown in FIGS. 1 and 3. For instance, in FIG. 3 it will be observed that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> cutting edge 21</span> is concave in the vertical plane while the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> cutting edge 24</span> is convex and precisely mates with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> cutting edge 21</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   With the structure as described above, the curvature of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">g heads 16 and 17</span></span> can be modified by displacing the cutters relative to the channels and 11 by tightening and loosening the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> nut 34</span>. Because of the taper of the legs of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> channe<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">ls 10 and 11</span></span>, as the cutting heads and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> associ<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">ated springs 18 and 19</span></span> are drawn inwardly, the width of the cutting heads will decrease and thereby increase the curvature thereof. This action is shown in FIGS. 2 and 4. In FIG. 2 the cutting members are in an outer position with the forward portions of the cutting heads spaced from the center line of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> pin 38</span> a distance X and the cutting heads have a radius R. In FIG. 4 the cutting heads have been moved inwardly so that the distance X has been reduced to the distance Y and the radius has been decreased to R1. In this way the radius of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">g heads 16 and 17</span></span> can be readily adjusted to meet the desires of the user. Inasmuch as each cutting head has a length sufficient to cut an entire nail at one time, then by properly adjusting the cutting members and placing the end of the finger against one of the members with the nail disposed between the cutting heads, precise shaping of the nails can be accomplished. Furthermore, multiple sets of cutting heads can be provided in order to afford the user the choice of various ranges of curvatures.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the embodiment of the invention thus far described, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">g heads 16 and 17</span></span> have been illustrated as having substantially uniform thickness throughout the length and an enlarged view of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cutting blade 16</span> is shown in FIG. 5. In order to obtain a sharper curvature, the cutting members can be made somewhat thinner through the center as shown in the blade 16a in FIG. 6. It will be observed in this figure that the center of the blade is very much thinner than the edges so that as the blade is drawn into the associated channel member to increase the curvature, the center curvature of the blade will curve more sharply than the outer portions. If desired, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">g members 16 and 17</span></span> may have any desired ornamental configuration such as a scalloped effect as shown on the blade 16b in FIG. 7. Although only one ornamental blade configuration is shown, it is apparent that any desired ornamental configuration may be utilized.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   While only certain embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it is apparent that alterations, modifications and changes may be made without departing from the true scope and spirit thereof as defined by the appended claims.   </p>
