                        <p>   Figure 1 is a perspective view of a fingernail clipper embodying one ,form of my 1nvention. Fig. 2 is a side elevatlonal View of the clipper shown in Fig. 1. F1g. 3 1s a longitudinal sectional view,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> some parts 1n 7</span> elevation, taken through the longitudinal center of the instrument shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 4 is a front end elevation of the instrument shown in Fig. &#39;1. F 1g. 5 is a top plan view of a modified construction. Fig. 6 is a longitudinal SBCtlOHZLhVlGW through the longitudinal center of F1g. 5. Fig. &#39;7 is a front elevational v ew of the instrument shown in Figs. 5 and 6. 0 Referring to Figs. 1 to &#39;4 lncluslve, 1 is the body of the clipper formed of sheet metal, preferably of steel which w1ll take a suitable temper at the cutting portlons and a spring temper at other portions. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> body 1</span> is normally av substantially rectan- 4 gular blank piece of sheet metal from which the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> tongue 2</span> is separated or punched, 1ts one end remaining integral with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> body portion 1</span>. The separation of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> tongue 2</span> from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> body member 1</span> leaves the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> s de m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">embers 3, 3</span></span> of the body portion, these<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> side members 3</span> being joined at the front end by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> preferably curved narrow piece 4</span>. With the inner edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> HZLITOW member 4</span> is adapted to cooperate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> front edge 5</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> tongue member 2</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> cutting or clipplng edge 5</span> being preferably curved to correspond with the preferably curved inner cutting or clipping edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> member 4</span>. As shown in Fig. 4, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> edge 5</span> is preferably lncllned with respect to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> member 4</span>, though elther Specification of Letters Patent.   </p>

                        <p>  or both of these members may be inclined. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> sides 3</span> may be bowed as indicated at 3 and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> tongue 2</span> bowed asindicated at 2, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> tongue 2</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> portion 2</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> sides 3</span> and their<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> parts 3</span> having preferably a spring temper while the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> parts <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">4 and 5</span></span> are given a temper suitable for finger nail clipping purposes. The body portion may be provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> hole 6</span> for receiving a chain, hook or any other suitable means for carrying or securing the clipper. And the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> body portion 1</span> may be provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> nail file portion 7</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> pointed portion 8</span> for nail cleaning purposes. Normally the parts of the finished instrument are substantially in the position indicated in the drawing. The user may place the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> narrow curved member 4</span> beneath the nail to be clipped and press downwardly upon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> bow 2</span> and upwardly upon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> bows 3</span> causing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> member<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">s 4 and 5</span></span> to come together and, due to their inclination, pass each other at their edges and in so doing clip the nail, and upon release of the pressure of the hand or fingers upon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> parts <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">2 and 3</span></span> the parts will assume their normal position. I   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring to Figs. 5 to 7 inclusive, the part 4, similar to that in Fig. l, connects the ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> member<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">s 9 and 10</span></span> formed by punching out from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> upper member 11</span> a piece leaving an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> aperture 12</span> to allow free movement therethrough of the forward end 13-of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> member 14</span> which carries at its forward end the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> cutting edge 5</span>. Here the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> member<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">s 14 and 11</span></span> are integral and formed by bending back upon itself apiece of sheet metal. Normally the partsstand in the position indicated in the drawings and by applying the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> member 4</span> to the nail and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> squeez<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">ing members 11 and 14</span></span> toward each other the nail is clipped as described in connection with the instrument shown in Fig. 1.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   While I have indicated the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> cooper<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">ating cutting members 4 and 5</span></span> at the front of the instrument in both modifications it is to be understood that they may be otherwise suitably located with respect to t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">he rela<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">tively springing or moving members 2 and 3</span></span>, of Fig. 1,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> or 11 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">and 14</span></span> of Figs. 5 to 7 inelusive.   </p>
