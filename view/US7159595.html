                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND  </p>
                    
                        <p>    This invention relates to a pad for nail care devices. The pad may consist of one part or a combination of parts. Specifically, it may consist of a pad, a pad holder with a pad, or a padded base engaging case, individually or in any combination of these, depending upon the structure of the nail care device. These are hereinafter collectively referred to as a padded receiving device. A nail clipper and a nail file are used to illustrate the padded receiving device. These padded receiving devices provide comfort and enhance control in handling the nail care devices.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Present nail care devices are mostly made of metal which when used constantly could be uncomfortable. These also promote the growth of corn and callouses on the areas repeatedly pressed by the device. Further, metal surfaces can be slippery which can cause accidental clipping of unintended areas of the nails or fingers when the user loses control of the device. Sweat, moisture, lotion and moisturizers on the fingers aggravate the situation. The claimed padded devices using the pads of this invention are meant to aid manicurists, nail care providers and others who constantly use the device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    U.S. Pat. No. 5,052,416 discloses a control improving component for fingernail clippers. These fingernail clippers as disclosed are constructed for use and access by individuals with reduced or impaired manual dexterity. These grip control improving devices are mountable to existing nail clippers. Because it is designed for the challenged individuals, these improving devices are enlarged to ensure easy accessibility, operation and incorporate safeguards that prevent the fingers from easily slipping out of the nail clipper. The safeguards are thumb/finger abutments that slope sizably like a bump in the road in front of the fingers. Since these abutments press on the fingers, they pose the same problem of promoting the formation of corns and callouses after repeated and prolong usage.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The nail clipper collectively refers to fingernail and toenail clippers. The padded receiving areas for the fingers are usually located near the distal end of the nail clipper where the finger or fingers are placed. The distal end is the end opposite the cutting members of the nail clipper. The claimed padded receiving device for the nail clipper consists of at least two parts and are installed in the lever arm and the base of the nail clipper to provide a soft surface to grip on for each finger involved with the operation of the nail clipper both when the nail clipper is in use and not in use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    It is an object of this invention to provide a padded finger receiving area on nail care devices to prevent the formation of corns and callouses on the fingers even after repeated and prolong use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    It is also an object of this invention to provide a pad for nail care devices that do not materially affect the overall size and shape of the device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    It is a further object of this invention to show how the pads are installed in the nail care devices.  </p>

                        <p>    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The invention is on a padded receiving device for nail care devices. The padded receiving device may comprise of one part or more than one part according to the choice of the manufacturer. One padded receiving device comprises a pad holder for supporting a pad which is preferably soft and resilient. The pad holder has a front slit wherein a nail care device is slipped through, the front slit having a width and height matching the width and height of the nail care device at the location where the pad holder is desired which is the place where the nail care device stops advancing after insertion. The pad holder has a top member having a first opening and a bottom member having a second opening, the top and bottom member molded in one piece or attached together. There is a hook with a head protruding laterally inward from a rear end of the bottom member towards the second opening which is used to attach the pad holder to the nail care device and to keep the bottom piece of the pad on the bottom member when the top piece of the pad is squeezed through the opening bored on the nail care device when the padded finger receiving device is installed. The pad for the pad holder has a top piece and a bottom piece which are joined together resulting into a single piece by a center piece, the center piece matching and covering the opening bored on the nail care device through which the pad is introduced into as stated above. The height of the center piece match the height of the front slit, the top piece has a size matching and covering the first opening of the top member of the pad holder, while the bottom piece has a size matching and covering the second opening of the bottom member of the pad holder. The bottom piece has a cut etched out on a rear end to accommodate the head of the hook extending from the bottom member of the pad holder to keep the bottom piece of the pad on the bottom member during the installation of the padded receiving device on nail care devices.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The padded receiving device may solely consist of the pad independent of the pad holder. In this case, the bottom piece does not need a cut etched out. In both devices described, the pad preferably and in some cases must protrude from either external surfaces of the pad holder or the surfaces the nail care device if a pad holder is not used.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The top and bottom faces or either one of the faces of the pad holder may be flat or curved. The external surfaces of the top and bottom pieces of the pad or either one of them may be additionally carved to ergonomically accommodate a finger.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    If the nail care device has a base such as in a nail clipper, the padded receiving device further comprises a padded base engaging case. The padded base engaging case has a case having an opening bored at a location where a pad covering and protruding from the opening of the base engaging case is desired. The base engaging case is made of resilient material to snugly enclose the base of the nail care device, leaving open, sides needed for the operation of a functioning part of the nail care device. The pad used for the base engaging case or simply referred to as case, has a top end and a bottom end, the bottom end having a lip extending laterally from the bottom end to prevent the pad from falling off the opening of the base engaging case. The make up of this pad is similar to the pad used with the pad holder described above. Additional structures such a flange or flanges inwardly extending from the interior surface of the case and made to rest on top of the base or a component of the base reinforce the engagement of the base with the base engaging case.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    These padded receiving devices are easily installed into the nail care devices. The description on the manner it is installed and used with nail clippers and nail files provides teaching on how these padded devices can be installed in other nail care devices not shown such as tweezers, cuticle removers, brushes, etc.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Nail clippers  1</span>  are basically constructed with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lever arm  2</span>  to control the engagement of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">top cutting member  3</span>  with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">bottom cutting member  4</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">base  5</span> .  FIG. 1  shows the use of the padded receiving device of this invention on a nail clipper in a close position while  FIG. 2  shows the padded nail clipper in an open ready to use position. The description herein applies to both fingernail clippers and toenail clippers. The invention is specific to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">padded receiving device  6</span>  as used for example for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lever arm  2</span>  and to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">padded receiving device  7</span>  as used for example with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">base  5</span> . Therefore, the other parts of the nail clipper will be described only as needed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">padded receiving device  6</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lever arm  2</span>  are installed by boring an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">opening  8</span>  on the lever arm as shown in  FIG. 3 . The shape of this opening may vary and is at the discretion of the manufacturer. The shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">opening  8</span>  usually but not always dictate the shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">padded receiving device  6</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">padded receiving device  6</span>  may be a combination of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">pad holder  9</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">pad  10</span>  or a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">pad  10</span>  by itself. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">pad holder  9</span>  as shown in  FIGS. 2 ,  4 A and  4 B is slipped from the distal end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lever arm  2</span> . The distal end is the end opposite the cutting members. In the type of pad holder shown in  FIG. 4C , there is a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">slit  11</span>  at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">front end  12</span>  while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">rear end  13</span>  is closed, not allowing the distal end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lever arm  2</span>  to go through. In the alternate design of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">pad holder  9</span>  as shown in  FIG. 4D , there are slits on both the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">front  12</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">rear end  13</span> . These pad holders are more suitable for use on other nail care devices such as emery boards and nail files where the pad holder can be made to slip into and through the specific nail care device and made to lodge at positions where the fingers hold the respective devices. In this application, to position the pad holder, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">front slit  14</span>  should match the width and height or thickness of the nail care device where the pad holder should stop advancing while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">rear slit  15</span>  matches the width and height or thickness of the nail care device at the location of the rear slit. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">pad holder  9</span>  may be molded in one piece or attached together from two pieces, with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">top member  16</span>  fused or glued to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">bottom member  17</span> . There is an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">opening  18</span> , referred to as first opening on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">top member  16</span>  and another <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">opening  19</span> , referred to as second opening on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">bottom member  17</span>  as shown in  FIGS. 4C and 4D . For proper orientation, the designation of top and bottom follows their position when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lever arm  2</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail clipper  1</span>  is in a close position. Consequently, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">bottom member  17</span>  switches to the top when the lever arm is switched to an open ready to use position. In this position, the bottom member would be the one directly engaging with the finger when the nail clipper is in use. As shown in  FIG. 4A , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first opening  18</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">top member  16</span>  is slightly bigger than the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">opening  8</span>  on the lever arm. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">second opening  19</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">bottom member  17</span>  may be made even bigger than the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">opening  18</span>  if a wider padded area is desired since this member as stated above, switches to the top when the nail clipper is in use. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">Both openings  18</span>  and  19  preferably have the same shape and contour as the shape of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">opening  8</span>  on the lever arm. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">width  20</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">height  21</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">front slit  14</span>  is just enough to allow the lever arm to slip in. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lever arm  2</span>  of the nail clipper is advanced into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">pad holder  9</span>  until the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">distal edge  22</span>  of the lever arm touches the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">interior surface  23</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">rear end  13</span> . The width and height of the front slit and the width and height of the interior surface of the rear end of the pad holder correspond to the respective widths and height or thickness of the lever arm to snugly fit the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">pad holder  9</span>  at the distal end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lever arm  2</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">hook  24</span>  as shown in  FIGS. 4A ,  4 Aâ€²,  4 C and  4 E, protrude laterally inward towards the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">second opening  19</span>  from the rear end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">bottom member  17</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">hook  24</span>  faces upwards and attaches at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">rear side  25</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">opening  8</span>  of the lever arm as shown in  FIG. 4A  to keep the pad holder in place. After the pad holder fully engages with the lever arm, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">head  26</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">hook  24</span>  extends beyond the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">rear side  25</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">opening  8</span> . This <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">protruding head  26</span>  is used to engage the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">pad holder  9</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">pad  10</span> . The pad holder may be flat on both top and bottom face as shown in  FIGS. 4C and 4D  but it may also be curved as desired in either or both faces as shown in  FIGS. 2 and 4E .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">pad  10</span>  as shown in  FIG. 5  is a single piece having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">top piece  27</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">bottom piece  28</span>  joined together by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">center piece  29</span>  matching the contour and covering the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">depth  30</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">opening  8</span>  of the lever arm. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">height  31</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">center piece  29</span>  matches the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">height  21</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">front slit  14</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">top piece  27</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">pad  10</span>  matches the contour and covers the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first opening  18</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">pad holder  9</span>  as shown in  FIG. 5A . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">bottom piece  28</span>  matches the contour and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">covers second opening  19</span>  of the pad holder as shown in  FIG. 2 . The bottom piece of the pad has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">cut  32</span>  etched out on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">rear end  33</span>  to accommodate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">protruding head  26</span>  of the hook extending from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">bottom member  17</span> . To provide comfort for the user, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">top piece  27</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">pad  10</span>  may protrude from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">top member  16</span>  of the pad holder and is made of soft and resilient material such as gel, silicone, latex and other rubber like materials. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">bottom piece  28</span> , however, must protrude from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">bottom member  17</span>  because this is the piece exposed to the fingers when the nail clipper is in the use position. This is likewise made of the same material as the top piece. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">center piece  29</span>  may be made of the same material as the top and bottom pieces to facilitate the molding of the pad. This design protects the fingers from pressing on the hard surface of the pad holder and the nail clipper thereby preventing the formation of corn and callouses. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">respective external surfaces  34</span>  of the top and bottom pieces may be ergonomically carved to accommodate the fingers, for example, with one concave as shown in  FIG. 8A , two adjacent concave carvings as shown in  FIG. 8B  or with one side sloping more than the other as shown in  FIG. 8C . Carving is not necessary if the top and bottom pieces of the pad are made of gel because this will follow the shape of the fingers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The main function of the pad holder is to support the pad. The pad holder may lengthen the usable life of the pad. However, the pad can be installed on the nail care device independent of the pad holder by directly introducing the pad into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">opening  8</span>  of the lever arm without the use of a pad holder as shown in  FIG. 6 . To install, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">top piece  27</span>  of the pad is merely squeezed through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">opening  8</span>  and allowed to rest on the top external surface of the lever arm with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">center piece  29</span>  residing at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">opening  8</span>  while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">bottom piece  28</span>  covers and rests on the external bottom surface of the lever arm. The surface area of the top piece may be different from the bottom piece and if no pad holder will be used with the pad, there is no need to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">etch out cut  32</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    To install the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">pad  10</span>  in a pad holder, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">latter  9</span>  should be fully inserted to the lever arm at a position shown in  FIGS. 2 and 4A . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lever arm  2</span>  is flipped over to an open ready to use position. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">top piece  27</span>  of the pad is squeezed through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">opening  8</span>  of the lever arm but prior to squeezing, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">head  26</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">hook  24</span>  is slipped into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">etched out cut  32</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">bottom piece  28</span>  of the pad. After the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">top piece  27</span>  squeezes through and lodges itself and covers the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first opening  18</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">top member  16</span>  of the pad holder, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">bottom piece  28</span>  rests, covers and protrudes from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">second opening  19</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">bottom member  17</span>  while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">centerpiece  29</span>  of the pad resides at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">opening  8</span> . The above assembly and installation provide a padded area on both external surfaces of the top and bottom members of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">pad holder  9</span> . The padded area on the top member need not but preferably protrude from the external top surface of the lever arm because this side is not constantly pressed upon. The padded area on the bottom member, however, has to protrude from the external bottom surface of the lever arm because it is this side that is constantly pressed upon on usage to prevent the formation of corn and callouses and provide comfort to the user.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    To provide a padded area on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">base  5</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail clipper  1</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">padded base engaging case  35</span> , an example of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">padded receiving device  7</span>  shown in detail on  FIGS. 7 and 9  is used to hold the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">pad  36</span> . As in the lever arm of the nail clipper, an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">opening  37</span>  is bored on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">base engaging case  35</span>  at a location where the padded area is desired. The base engaging case is constructed to snugly enclose the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">base  5</span>  leaving open, however, the sides needed for the unobstructed operation of the functioning parts of the nail care device such as the side where the top and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">bottom cutting members  3</span>  and  4  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lever arm  2</span>  are located. Snugly means once the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">base  5</span>  is engaged with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">base engaging case  35</span> , the base engaging case does not fall off from the base and the external sides of the base touch the corresponding internal surfaces of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">base engaging case  35</span> , hereinafter also simply referred to as case. Generally, the shape of the base engaging case conforms with the shape of the base of the nail care device in order to snugly enclose the base. The case for the nail clipper has three side walls and a bottom face. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">bottom face  38</span>  is shaped according to the shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">base  5</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail clipper  1</span>  as shown in  FIG. 4B . Aside from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">opening  37</span>  on the case, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">internal surface  39</span>  of the case may have indentations to accommodate protruding parts on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">base  5</span>  such as the base of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">connector  40</span>  which holds the top and bottom cutting members. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">One side  41</span> , which in this example is the front side of the case, is open. This is usually the side through which the base is introduced into the case. The three sides, two lateral sides and a rear side have walls extending upwards from their <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">peripheral edges  42</span> ,  43 , and  44  to form a continuous upstanding wall. The walls are not of the same height. The height of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">lateral walls  45</span>  and  46  varies according to the shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">top plate  47</span>  extending from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">top cutting member  3</span>  as shown in  FIGS. 1 ,  2  and  6 . The height of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">rear wall  48</span>  is just enough to cover the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem49">corresponding rear side  49</span>  of the base. The interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">lateral walls  45</span>  and  46  incorporates <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">at least one inwardly extending flange  50</span>  on each side of the wall directly opposite each other. If there are more than one flange on each wall, the plurality of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">flanges  50</span>  are in a juxtaposed, spaced and cooperating relationship. These flanges are preferably positioned above or on top of the base or a desired component of the base, which in the case of nail clippers, rest on top of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">surface  52</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">bottom plate  51</span>  extending from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">bottom cutting member  4</span>  when the base is fully engaged with the case as shown in  FIG. 9 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">flanges  50</span>  aid in keeping the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">base  5</span>  of the nail clipper engaged with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">case  35</span> . When the base is fully inserted in the case, only the top and bottom cutting members, the connector and the lever arm are exposed as shown in  FIGS. 1 ,  2 ,  3  and  6 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">opening  37</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">case  35</span>  can be of any desired shape. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">base engaging case pad  36</span>  inserts, covers and protrudes from the opening. Consequently, the shape of the pad conforms to the contour of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">opening  37</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">thickness  53</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">base engaging case pad  36</span>  is greater than the thickness of the case to allow the pad to protrude beyond the external surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">bottom face  38</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">case  35</span> . As shown in  FIGS. 8A ,  8 B and  8 C, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">base engaging case pad  36</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">lip  54</span>  extending laterally from the bottom of the pad to serve as a stopper when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">pad  36</span>  is inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">opening  37</span>  thereby preventing the pad from falling off. The lip preferably .surrounds the bottom of the pad and extends laterally beyond the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">opening  37</span> . The lip is very thin so as not to interfere or block the entry of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">base  5</span>  into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">case  35</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">external surfaces  34</span>  may also be carved ergonomically in the same manner as the external surfaces of the top and bottom piece of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">pad  10</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    To install the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">padded receiving device  7</span>  for the base into the nail clipper, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">pad  36</span>  is first inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">opening  37</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">top surface  55</span>  inserting through the opening until the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">lip  54</span>  engages with the internal surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">bottom face  38</span>  of the case. At this point, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">base  5</span>  of the nail clipper is inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">open side  41</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">case  35</span>  with the rear side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem49">base  49</span>  introduced first until this engages with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">rear internal surface  39</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">case  35</span> . During the insertion, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">flanges  50</span>  should be positioned on top of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">bottom plate  51</span>  as described above. Because the base is introduced into the case through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">open side  41</span> , the material from which the case is made must be resilient to tolerate the variable width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">base  5</span>  as it inserts into the case. Examples of suitable plastic materials for the case are made from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resin; styrene-acrylonitrile resin; cellulose acetate butyrate; polycarbonate; polyethylene; polypropylene; polystyrene; and, polyvinylchloride acetate.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The padded receiving device of this invention is shown herein installed on nail clippers. However, the padded receiving device may be applied to other nail care devices such as the nail files currently available in the market. Some nail files already have an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">opening  56</span>  as shown in  FIG. 10 . It is very easy to put a pad with a pad holder on this opening as shown in  FIG. 10A  or without a pad holder as shown in  FIG. 10B  in the same manner described for the lever arm above. If a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">pad holder  9</span>  is used for this, it should use the pad holder shown in  FIG. 4D  because the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">body  57</span>  of the nail file needs to enter the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">front slit  14</span>  and exit the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">rear slit  15</span>  of the pad holder. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">slits  14</span>  and  15  should just be enough to accommodate the width and the height or thickness of the nail file at the corresponding locations so as to snugly fit into the nail file.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    While the embodiment of the present invention has been described, it should be understood that various changes, modifications and adaptations may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other and further variations of the features presented herein are possible. The scope of the present invention should be determined by the teachings disclosed herein, the appended claims and their legal equivalents. </p>
