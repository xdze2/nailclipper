                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> An adjustable magnifying attachment for a hand held implement is provided. The adjustable magnifying attachment includes a support base, an extension arm, a lens holder, and a magnifying lens. The support base has a hole and a slot, which is configured to receive a portion of the hand held implement and to secure the support base on the hand held implement. The extension arm has a first end section and a second end section. The first end section of the extension arm is snugly mounted in the hole in the base but may still rotate and slide in the hole in the support base. The second end section of the extension arm terminates in a clip. The lens holder retains the magnifying lens and includes a mounting bracket with a pivot rod that joins a pair of opposed bracket arms at a position spaced apart from the lens holder. The pivot rod is secured in the clip of the extension arm so that the lens holder may pivot about the pivot rod. The magnifying attachment has a wide range of adjustability even after the magnifying attachment is mounted on a hand held implement. This allows the user to position the magnifying lens near the object being worked on so that best viewing angle and distance can be attained. </p>

                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This invention relates generally to a magnifying device and more particularly to a magnifying lens attachment for a hand held implement such as nail clippers, cutters, tweezers, pliers and the like.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Description of the Related Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is known that a magnifying lens may be attached to a hand held instrument in order to provide the user with an enlarged image of the object being worked on. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,680,210 discloses a nail clipper device having a protective magnifying element which magnifies the blades and nail during the clipping operation; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,956,915 and 5,546,658 disclose nail clipping devices which include an enclosure having a magnifying zone for magnifying the clipper jaws and a fingernail during the clipping operation; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,263,754 and 5,358,297 disclose tweezers having a magnifying lens which may be positioned over the tip of the tweezers in order to assist the user in sighting the foreign object to be removed by the tweezers; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,398,800 discloses an adjustable magnifying device that may be clamped on a hand held implement.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      While these devices can provide a user with enlarged images of an object being worked on, it is well known that magnifying lenses only provide optimum, clear enlarged images when an object is viewed through the magnifying lens at certain angles and distances. For instance, the spatial relationship between the user&#39;s eye, the magnifying lens, and the object being worked on can significantly affect the clarity of the object being magnified. In addition, viewing an object through a magnifying lens when the lens is at an angle to either the user&#39;s eye or the object can create blurring and distortion in the image. In order to optimize the clarity of the enlarged image, a magnifying lens must be movable to a distance and angle from the user&#39;s eye that provides the clearest image. Often, known magnifying attachments do not provide the wide range of adjustability and maneuverability that is required in order to place the magnifying lens at the optimum position for magnification. Furthermore, known magnifying attachments which do provide for adjustability are often quite cumbersome and therefore, are difficult to attach to a hand held implement.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, there is a need for a magnifying attachment for a hand held implement that provides for a wide range of adjustability and maneuverability so that the enlarged image of the object being magnified is as clear as possible.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an adjustable magnifying attachment that may be adjusted in many different directions after the attachment has been mounted on a hand held implement.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an adjustable magnifying attachment that may be easily mounted on a hand held implement without the need for a complicated and cumbersome mounting structure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention is directed to an adjustable magnifying attachment for a hand held implement that satisfies the need for a magnifying attachment that may be adjusted in many different directions after the attachment has been mounted on an implement. An adjustable magnifying attachment having the features of the present invention broadly comprises a support base, an extension arm, a lens holder, and a magnifying lens.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The support base of the magnifying attachment has a hole and a slot, both of which may extend from one side of the support base to another side of the support base. The slot is configured to receive a portion of the hand held implement and to secure the support base on the hand held implement.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The extension arm has a first end section and a second end section. The first end section of the extension arm is snugly mounted in the hole in the base but may still rotate and slide in the hole in the support base when a user adjusts the extension arm position. The second end section of the extension arm terminates in a C-shaped clip.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The lens holder retains the magnifying lens and includes a mounting bracket. The mounting bracket has a pair of opposed bracket arms which extend outwardly from the lens holder and a pivot rod joining the opposed bracket arms at a position spaced apart from the lens holder. The pivot rod is secured in the clip of the extension arm so that the lens holder may pivot about the pivot rod when a user adjusts the lens holder.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      With this configuration of the lens holder, extension arm and support base, a wide range of adjustability is possible even after the magnifying attachment is mounted on a hand held implement. For instance, the extension arm of the magnifying attachment may be translated by a user toward or away from the support base when the extension arm is mounted in the hole of the support base. The extension arm may also be rotated by a user in any direction when the extension arm is mounted in the hole of the support base. Also, in many installations, the support base of the magnifying attachment may be moved by a user along the portion of the hand held implement on which the support base is mounted. In addition, the lens holder retaining the magnifying lens can be moved freely in an arc by a user as the pivot rod of the lens holder mounting bracket is arranged in the C-shaped clip of the extension arm. This wide range of adjustability of the magnifying attachment of the present invention allows the user to position the magnifying lens so that best viewing angle and distance can be attained.  </p>

In the version of the invention shown, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> slot 24</span> has a rectangular shape.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      With reference to FIG. 5, there is shown the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> lens holder 32</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> magnifying lens 38</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> magnifying lens attachment 20</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> lens holder 32</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> rim 33</span> in which the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> magnifying lens 38</span> is retained. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> magnifying lens 38</span> may be made of glass or transparent rigid plastic. On the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> rim 33</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> lens holder 32</span> is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> mounting bracket 34</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> mounting bracket 34</span> includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> first bracket arm 35</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> second bracket arm 36</span> with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37"> pivot rod 37</span> joining the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> bracke<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">t arms 35,36</span></span> at a position spaced apart from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> rim 33</span>. In the version of the lens holder shown, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> first bracket arm 35</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> second bracket arm 36</span> extend outwardly from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> rim 33</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> lens holder 33</span> in substantially parallel alignment, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37"> pivot rod 37</span> is substantially perpendicular to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> oppose<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">d bracket arms 35,36</span></span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to FIGS. 4A and 4B, various versions of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> magnifying lens attachment 20</span> are shown. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> first end section 27</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> second end section 28</span> which terminates in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> C-shaped clip 30</span>. The extension arms shown have a circular cross-section but may also be formed in other shapes. The version of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> shown in FIG. 4B also includes an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> elbow 29</span> which connects the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> first end section 27</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> second end section 28</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span>. In the version shown in FIG. 4B, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> elbow 29</span> is configured so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> first end section 27</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> second end section 28</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> are coplanar and form a substantially right angle.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Turning now to FIG. 2, it can be seen that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> C-shaped clip 30</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> is fitted over<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37"> pivot rod 37</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> mounting bracket 34</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> lens holder 32</span>. In this arrangement between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> clip 30</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37"> pivot rod 37</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> lens holder 32</span> with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> magnifying lens 38</span> can move freely in an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> arc 40</span> (shown in phantom in FIGS. 1 and 2). Such fittings between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> clip 30</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37"> pivot rod 37</span> are usually accomplished with a snap fitting due to the flexibility of material (such as plastic) from which the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> clip 30</span> are made.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to FIG. 1, there is shown an assembled version of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">the adjustable magnifying lens attachment 20</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> C-shaped clip 30</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> is fitted over<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37"> pivot rod 37</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> mounting bracket 34</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> lens holder 32</span>, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> first end section 27</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> is mounted in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> hole 23</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> hole 23</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span> are configured so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> first end section 27</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> fits snugly in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> hole 23</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span>. However, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> hole 23</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span> must be dimensioned such that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> can still move within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> hole 23</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      With a proper construction of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> hole 23</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> first end section 27</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> may translated by a user freely in any direction along the arrows designated at T in FIG. 1 and may be rotated by a user freely in any direction along the arrows designated at R in FIG. 1 when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> is mounted in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> hole 23</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span>. However, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> must fit snugly in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> hole 23</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span> so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> does not slip out of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> hole 23</span>. By forming the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span> from an elastic material as noted above, it is possible to effectively retain the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span> while still allowing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> to move in the &#34;T&#34; and &#34;R&#34; directions.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> slot 24</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span> may be dimensioned in various configurations so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> magnifying attachment 20</span> may be secured on any number of hand held implements. Typically, a hand held implement that would benefit from the provision of a magnifying lens is examined to determine the location where a magnifying attachment could be mounted on the implement. The portion of the hand held implement that could be surrounded by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span> is then measured. When fabricating the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> slot 24</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span> is dimensioned so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> slot 24</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span> can receive the portion of the hand held implement and can snugly secure the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span> on the hand held implement. In this manner, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span> can be held steady on the hand held implement.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> magnifying attachment 20</span> of the present invention is suitable for use with many different hand held implements but has proven to be particularly advantageous when used with nail clippers, cutters, tweezers, and pliers. Therefore, the use of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> magnifying attachment 20</span> with these hand held implements is described hereinbelow in order to further illustrate uses of the invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      One hand held implement whose operation may be significantly enhanced by the magnifying attachment of the present invention is a nail clippers. Referring now to FIGS. 6A, 6B and 6C, there is shown a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45"> nail clippers 45</span> of the conventional type. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45"> nail clippers 45</span> includes an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> elongated upper spring member 46</span> and an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> elongated lower spring member 50</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> upper spring member 46</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47"> front end 47</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> rear end 48</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> lower spring member 50</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51"> front end 51</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> rear end 52</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> upper spring member 46</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> lower spring member 50</span> are secured together at their respective rear ends by suitable means such as riveting or welding. In the nail clippers shown, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> rear end 48</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> upper spring member 46</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> rear end 52</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> lower spring member 50</span> are secured together by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55"> rivet 55</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47"> front end 47</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> upper spring member 46</span> terminates in an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem49"> upper jaw 49</span>, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51"> front end 51</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> lower spring member 50</span> terminates in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53"> lower jaw 53</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem49"> upper jaw 49</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53"> lower jaw 53</span> are biased slightly apart to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> define opposed cutting edges 54</span>. An<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> actuating lever 56</span> is operatively associated with the front ends of the upper and lower spring members for releasably forcing the cutting edges into engagement with each other and cutting a fingernail or toenail disposed therebetween. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> actuating lever 56</span> is carried by an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> upper end 58</span> of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57"> central pivot fastener 57</span> rotatably secured upwardly through a forward portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> lower spring member 50</span> and rotatably received upwardly through a forward portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> upper spring member 46</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> actuating lever 56</span> is pivotally mounted from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> upper end 58</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57"> central pivot fastener 57</span> projecting above the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> upper spring member 46</span>. In operation, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> actuating lever 56</span> is pivoted toward the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> upper spring member 46</span> in order to move the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem49"> upper jaw 49</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53"> lower jaw 53</span> together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The nail clippers structure heretofore described is conventional and well known. However, as seen from FIG. 6C, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45"> conventional nail clippers 45</span> may be provided with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> magnifying attachment 20</span> of the present invention in order to magnify and present an improved view of both the jaws of the nail clippers and the object being cut during the clipping operation. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> magnifying attachment 20</span> may be mounted on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45"> nail clippers 45</span> by inserting the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> actuating lever 56</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45"> nail clippers 45</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> slot 24</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> magnifying attachment 20</span>. As noted above, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> slot 24</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span> is configured so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> actuating lever 56</span> fits snugly in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> slot 24</span>. This assures that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span> remains fixed on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> actuating lever 56</span> when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45"> nail clippers 45</span> is operated.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It can be appreciated that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> magnifying attachment 20</span> of the present invention provides for maximum adjustability when mounted on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45"> nail clippers 45</span>. As shown in FIG. 6C, the positioning of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> magnifying lens 38</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> magnifying attachment 20</span> may be adjusted in numerous directions.

Second, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> magnifying attachment 20</span> may be rotated by a user in any direction along the arrows designated at R when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> extension arm 26</span> is mounted in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> hole 23</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span>. Third, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> magnifying attachment 20</span> may be slid by a user in any direction along the arrows designated at S when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> actuating lever 56</span> is inserted in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> slot 24</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support base 22</span>. Fourth, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> lens holder 32</span> with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> magnifying lens 38</span> can be moved freely by a user in an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> arc 40</span> (as shown in phantom in FIGS. 1 and 2). The wide range of adjustability of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> magnifying attachment 20</span> of the present invention allows the user of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> nail clippers assembly 44</span> to position the magnifying lens so that best viewing angle and distance can be attained.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Another hand held implement whose operation may be significantly enhanced by the magnifying attachment of the present invention is a cutters, such as a cuticle cutters, mini cutters, scissors or the like. Referring now to FIGS. 7A, 7B, 7C and 7D, there is shown an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem65"> improved cutters assembly 65</span> which generally comprises a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> standard cutters 66</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> magnifying attachment 20</span> in accordance with the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> cutters 66</span> may be of any standard construction, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> cutters 66</span> illustrated herein is a conventional and well-known type. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> cutters 66</span> has a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> oppose<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem69">d handle arms 68 and 69</span></sp<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">an> inc<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71">luding respective handle portions 70,71</span></span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> centra<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73">lly located pivot portions 72,73</span></span>, and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> front <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75">blade portions 74,75</span></span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem69"> arms 68 and 69</span></span> are pivotally secured together by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> pivot pin 76</span> passing through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> pivot <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73">portions 72 and 73</span></span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In the type of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> cutters 66</span> illustrated herein, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> blade <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75">portions 74,75</span></span> each have a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem77"> cutting edge 77</span>. It will be seen in FIG. 7A, that when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> oppose<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem69">d handle arms 68 and 69</span></span> are moved toward each other, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> blade <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75">portions 74,75</span></span> are brought together in closed or cutting position with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem77"> cutting edges 77</span> in abutment with each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The cutters structure heretofore described is well known. In accordance with the invention herein, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> cutters 66</span> is also provided with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> magnifying attachment 20</span> which serves to magnify and present an improved view of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem77"> cutting edges 77</span> and the object being cut during the cutting operation.
