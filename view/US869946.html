                        <p>  To all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, ABRAHAM L. TOLMAN, a citizen of the United States, residing at Orange, in the county of Franklin and State of Massachusetts, have invented a new and useful Manicure Implement, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention has reference to improvements in manicure implements, and its object is to provide a pocket tool comprising pair of shear or scissor blades, a nail file, and a knife blade and in connection therewith cigar cutter.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The invention is designed to be made of suitable material, such as sheet steel, with the handle portion stamped out from the steel plate in such shape as to present no sharp or cutting edges and to provide lodgment for a suitable nail tile and knife blade and to form the coacting parts of the cigar cutter, while the shear or scissor blades are suitably formed, each in one piece with the respective handle portion, and are secured together-by a suitable screw or rivet, with a spring tending to separate the blades and against the tension of which the blades are caused to pass each other in the act of cutting. The spring is so arranged as to maintain the blades elastically in proper operative relation one to the other.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The device is provided with a suitable locking means whereby the blades are held in the closed position when designed to be placed in the pocket or in a containing case suited to the pocket.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The invention will be fully understood from the following detailed description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings forming part of this Figure 1 is a perspective view, with parts broken away, of the improved manicure implement; Fig. 2 is an end view, from the scissors end of the device; Fig. 3 is a section through the device across the nail file and knife blade; Fig. 4 is an end view, partly in section, looking at the end of the device remote from the scissors end; and Fig. 5&#39; is a modification of the manner of securing the nail file in place.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the drawings the structure is shown on a suitably enlarged scale, it being understood that the entire device is of a size about that of the ordinary curved,- blade scissors commonly known as nail scissors.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   There is shown in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> drawings two handle portions 12</span>, each terminating in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> blade 34</span> respectively, constituting the cutting blades of. a pair of scissors or shears, and these blades being suitably shaped with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> matching cutting edges 5</span> and either straight or, by preference, curved after the manner of ordinary curved nail scissors.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The handle l comprises a piece of sheet metal,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> say sheet steel,&#39;liaving one side 6</span> of appropriate width and another<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> side 7</span> of less width joined integrally along the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> outer edge 8</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem67"> members 67</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> handle 1</span> are in the main parallel one with the other and at a point about midway of the length of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> member 6</span> there is formed a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> perforation 9</span> with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> matching recess 10</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> member 7</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> handle 2</span> is likewise made up of two members 11-12 parallel with each other and integrally joined along their outer edges, as shown at 13. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> member 11</span> has formed on it a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> knife or cutting edge 14</span> so located that when the two handle members are closed together, as will hereinafter appear, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> knife edge 14</span> will pass between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> member<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">s 6 and 7</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> other handle 1</span> entirely across the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> perforation 9</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> counter-notch 01</span>&#39;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> recess 10</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> perforation 9</span> is of a suitable size to receive the end of a cigar and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cutting blade 14</span> will serve to shear off the end of the cigar.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">s 1 and 2</span></span> are connected together by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> pivot 15</span> adjacent to the butt ends of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> blades<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> 3 and 4</span></span>. This<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> pivot 15</span> is of such length as to receive sufficient turns of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring 16</span>, under compression, to maintain the two blades of the scissors in the proper cutting relation under the ordinary conditions of use. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> ends 17</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring 16</span> are elongated and are passed into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">s 1 and 2</span></span> between the side members thereof until they abut against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> respec<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">tive edges 8 and 13</span></span> of these two handles. The tendency of the spring is such that unless otherwise restrainedthe handles will move apart around their pivot until the cutting edges of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> blades<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> 3 and 4</span></span> are separated along their entire length. In order to operate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">g blades 3 and 4</span></span> of the scissors the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">s 1 and 2</span></span> must be brought together by moving them about the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> pivot 15</span> against the stress of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring 16</span> which, during this operation, is expanded and tends to force the blades continually into closer cutting relation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Near the end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> handle 1</span> remote from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> cutting blade 3</span> the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> edge 8</span> is cut away to form a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> slot 18</span>. Seated in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> handle 1</span> at this point is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> knife blade 19</span> having the rear end upturned to form a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> lug 20</span> which projects slightly through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> slot 18</span> so as to be easily reached by the fingernail of the user in order that the knife may be projected from out the rear end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> handle 1</span>, as indicated in dotted lines in Fig. 1, or may be withdrawn into said handle. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> knife blade 19</span> is of the ordinary taper type in cross section from the thick back to the cutting edge, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> side 7</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> handle 1</span> is bent in toward the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> other side 6</span> so as to conform in a manner to the shape of the knife blade, The latter is therefore firmly secured within the end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> handle 1</span> but at the same time may be easily moved out therefrom or withdrawn into the same. In order that the knife blade may be locked when withdrawn into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> handle 1</span>, the metal forming the walls of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> slot 18</span> adjacent to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> lug 20</span>, when the blade is entirely withdrawn into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> handle 1</span>, is provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> several notches 21</span> which will serve as retarding means for preventing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> knife blade 19</span> from being too easily started in a direction to project it from the handle.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> other handle 2</span> is likewise recessed, as shown at 22, to form a slot beneath which is presented the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> roughened edge 23</span> of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> nail file 24</span> which may be firmly secured in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> handle 2</span> between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> walls <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">11 and 12</span></span> thereof by suitably indenting the metal, as indicated at 25. The nail file may be additionally secured by means of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> clip 2<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">6</span> one leg 27</span> of which extends through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> both w<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">alls 11 and 12</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> handle 2</span> and through the corresponding end of the file housed therein. This<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> clip 26</span> has an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> overturned end 28</span> arranged to straddle the rear end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> handle 1</span> and lock in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> notch 29</span> formed in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> edge 8</span> thereof. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> clip 26</span> may be made of a continuous linlcii&#39; so desired.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  - function of maintaining the blades in operative cutting relation. There is also provided a nail file easily reached by the finger-nail, for taking off the rough edges &#39;left bythe scissors, and there isalso provided a knife bladefor any purpose for which it may be used. Also, as an additional implement of usefulness, the cigar cut ter forms an adjunct to the manicure scissors.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Instead of forming the walls 11-12 of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> handle 2</span> by turning the metal over on itself these walls may be made of separate pieces, as indicated in Fig. 5, and the nail file may be secured between these walls by means of rivets such as indicated; or screws may be used in place of the rivets. By making the file of a separate piece and afterward securing it in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> handle 2</span> the files may be made in quantities and hardened before being put in the handle, and the entire article maybe buffed and polished without danger of buffing the cutting edge off the file, as is liable to happen when the buffing is performed after the file has been inserted. Also, the walls of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> handle 2</span>, projecting above the cutting edge of the file, serve as a guide for and keep the finger nail in the groove while the file is being used.   </p>
