                        <p> FIELD OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]     The invention relates to a clipper for pet, and more particularly, relates to a clipper for pet wherein the user may cut the claw of a pet conveniently and safely and may remove the clipped claw fragments conveniently.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]     Previously, the inventor was inspired by a nail clipper for a person and created a clipper for pet (Korean Utility Model Registration No. 2000-9505375), which may clip the claw of a pet conveniently and safely.  FIG. 1  and  FIG. 2  show the ab<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">ove-mentioned prior art clipper for pet  1</span> . As shown in  FIGS. 1 and 2  of the drawings, a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">cutters  5</span> ,  6  are positioned in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span>  of a shaft shaped handle. And, among the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">cutters  5</span> ,  6 , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">fixed cutter element  5</span>  is fixed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">body  5</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">rotating cutter element  6</span>  is pivotally hinged on a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">hinge shaft  7</span>  so as to be elastically biased by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">spring  8</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">rotating cutter  6</span>  is rotated by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">thumb lever  10</span>  which extends through an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">opening  4</span>  formed on the upper surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">claw insertion hole  12</span>  for inserting the claw of the pet is formed at one side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span> , and an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">adjusting bolt  14</span>  is screwed at the other side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span>  opposite to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">claw insertion hole  12</span>  so that the insertion depth of the claw in the hole may be adjusted by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">adjusting bolt  14</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]     A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">battery chamber  18</span>  is formed inside the center of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span>  adjacent to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">motor  20</span>  is positioned in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span>  and is electrically connected to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">battery  16</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">grinder  22</span>  is positioned partly within and at the rear portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">body  5</span>  and is connected to the shaft of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">motor  20</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">grinder  22</span>  is partially exposed through an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">opening  24</span>  formed at the rear end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">body  5</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">switch  26</span>  for controlling operation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">motor  20</span>  is mounted at one side of the outer periphery of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">body  5</span> . Further, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">battery chamber  18</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">body  5</span>  are covered together with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">one cover  19</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]     Accordingly, the user may adjust the insertion length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">adjusting bolt  14</span>  and insert the claw of the pet between the fixing and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">rotating cutters  5</span> ,  6 , and may clip the claws by driving the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">rotating cutter  6</span>  by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">thumb lever  10</span> . Next, the user may contact the clipped claw with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">grinder  22</span>  through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">opening  24</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">body  5</span>  and energize the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">grinder  22</span>  by switching on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">switch  26</span>  to polish the sharp claw edges neatly.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]     According to the above clipper, as shown in  FIG. 1 , the user grips the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">body  5</span>  and pushes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">thumb lever  10</span>  which slantingly extends from the upper surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">body  5</span>  only by the force of a thumb. Accordingly, in case of a relatively big animal like a big dog, because the claws are relatively thick or hard, it is laborious to clip the claws by pushing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">thumb lever  10</span>  only by the thumb, and the claws are not easily clipped.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]     According to the above clipper, the claw fragments are held in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">body  5</span> , but the claw fragments may escape and be scattered outwardly from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span>  through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">opening  4</span>  through which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">thumb lever  10</span>  passes through so that the scattered claw fragments may contaminate the surroundings and may have a bad effect on sanitation and so on. According to the above clipper, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">cover  19</span>  for covering the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">battery chamber  18</span>  also covers the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">body  5</span> . Accordingly, when the user opens the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">cover  19</span>  in order to exchange a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">battery  16</span> , the claw fragments may drop from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">body  5</span>  accidentally. Also, when the user opens the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">cover  19</span>  in order to remove the claw fragments from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">battery  16</span>  may be dropped.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0007]     The invention is created to solve the above described problems and so the object of the invention is to provide a clipper for pet wherein the user may clip the claws of a pet conveniently and safely without the need for exerting relatively strong force and may remove the claw fragments neatly because they may not be discharged while clipping the claws and the surroundings may be kept clear.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]     According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a clipper for pet comprising a body having a handle form and a head positioned at a front portion of the body. The body has a claw insertion hole located at one side thereof. A cutting mechanism adjacent the hole has a fixed cutter element inside the head and a movable cutter element inside the head which cooperates with the fixed center element; and a lever connected to the cutter element and pivotally connected to the body for rotation relative to the body. The lever diagonally extends away from the front lower side of the body. An adjustable stop is mounted on the body and is movable to adjust the length a claw may be inserted into the hole.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]     According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a clipper for pet with a wall located to one side of the cutter mechanism. The wall partitions the interior of the body such that at least a portion of the cutter elements are isolated in a compartment into which at least the hole extends. There is a movable cover closing at least one side of the compartment.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]     According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a clipper for pet comprising a battery chamber inside the body; a motor energizable through a switch by a battery power source; a grinder drivingly connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">motor  5</span> , with the grinder located at least partly in the body and partially exposed through an opening provided in the body; and a battery chamber cover covering the battery chamber, wherein the battery chamber cover is formed as a separate member from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">outlet cover  34</span>  and positioned at the portion of the body located away from the compartment in the head.  </p>

                        <p>      BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0011]      FIG. 1  is an external view of the prior clipper for a pet.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]      FIG. 2  is a cross sectional view of  FIG. 1 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]      FIG. 3  and  FIG. 4  are respectively a front view and a rear view of the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0014]      FIG. 5  is a cross sectional view of the invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>       </p>

                        <p>      THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0015]     A preferred embodiment of the invention will be described in detail below by referring to the accompanying drawings.  FIG. 3  and  FIG. 4  are respectively a front view and a rear view of the invention, and  FIG. 5  is a sectional view of the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0016]     As shown in the drawings, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span>  of rounded shape is formed at the front end of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span>  having an elongated handle shaft shape, and a cutting mechanism is mounted in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span> , which includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">fixed cutter element  5</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">rotating cutter element  6</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">rotating cutter  6</span>  is pivotally connected to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">hinge shaft  7</span>  and is elastically biased by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">spring <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> 8</span>  like  8</span>  torsion spring. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">lever  11</span>  is combined at one side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">rotating cutter element  6</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">lever  11</span>  diagonally extends toward the lower direction of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span>  of the handle (i.e., in a direction diagonally sloping away from a lower forward bottom side of the body) through an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">opening  9</span>  formed at the lower surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span> . Here, because the length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">lever  11</span>  is elongated sufficiently, the user may grip the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span>  with the palm of the hand and may strongly grip the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">lever  11</span>  with four fingers except for a thumb or with three fingers except for a thumb and a little finger so that he/she may manipulate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">lever  11</span>  conveniently.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0017]     A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">claw insertion hole  12</span>  for inserting the claw of a pet is formed at one side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">head  5</span>  in which the fixing and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">rotating cutters  5</span> ,  6  are mounted. An <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">adjusting bolt  14</span>  for limiting the insertion depth of the claw in the hole is screwed at the other side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span>  which is the opposite side to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">claw insertion hole  12</span> . If the user operates the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">adjusting bolt  14</span>  to drive the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">bolt  14</span>  toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">claw insertion hole  12</span> , the insertion depth of the claw to be contacted at the front end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">adjusting bolt  14</span>  may be shortened. Contrarily, if the user operates the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">adjusting bolt  14</span>  to retreat the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">bolt  14</span>  toward the opposite direction to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">claw insertion hole  12</span> , the insertion depth of the claw extending to the front end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">adjusting bolt  14</span>  may be lengthened.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0018]     A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">wall  32</span>  for preventing the claw fragments from being scattered outwardly is positioned inside the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span>  to define a cut claw compartment. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">partition  32</span>  is adjacent to one side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">cutters  5</span> ,  6 , and it is positioned at the intermediate portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span>  in order to partition the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">opening  9</span>  where the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">lever  11</span>  is passed from the blade portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">cutters  5</span> ,  6 . An <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">outlet  33</span>  for the compartment and an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">outlet cover  34</span>  for discharging the claw fragments are positioned at the front periphery of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span> . Accordingly, the claw fragments will not be scattered through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">opening  9</span>  formed at the rear portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span>  because the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">opening  9</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span>  will be blocked by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">partition  32</span>  while clipping the claws. Whenever necessary, the user may remove the claw fragments through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">outlet  33</span>  by opening the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">outlet cover  34</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]     A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">battery chamber  18</span>  which is partitioned from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span>  is formed at the center of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">battery  16</span>  is detachably inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">battery chamber  18</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">motor  20</span>  is positioned at one side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">battery chamber  18</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">grinder  22</span>  in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span>  is connected to the shaft of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">motor  20</span> . Because the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">grinder  22</span>  is partially exposed through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">opening  24</span>  formed at the rear end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">body  2</span> , the user may grind the claws of the pet and finish the sharp claw edges neatly. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">motor  20</span>  may be driven when the electric power is turned on by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">switch  26</span>  mounted at the upper side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">body  20</span> . Here, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">battery cover  36</span>  is mounted at the portion outside the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span> . Accordingly, when the user opens the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">battery cover  36</span> , the claw fragments in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span>  will not drop outside the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">head  3</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>        INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0020]     According to the above described invention, the lever slantingly extends toward the lower direction of the body and the user may grip the lever with four fingers except for a thumb or with three fingers except for a thumb and a little finger. Accordingly, the invention has the advantage that the user may easily grip the lever and may apply relatively strong grip force to the lever so that he/she may manipulate it easily and may conveniently clip even relatively thick or hard claws of a relatively big animal like a big dog. A wall is positioned between the blade portion of the cutters and the rear opening of the head through which the lever extends so that the blade portion of the cutters and the opening may be blocked by the partition. Accordingly, the invention has the advantage that, because the claw fragments may be blocked by the partition while clipping the claws, the claw fragments are not scattered through the opening of the head, which is helpful for sanitation and the environment.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]     An outlet and an outlet cover for removing the claw fragments are formed at the front portion of the head, and the battery cover for covering a battery chamber is positioned at the portion which is outside the compartment of the head. Accordingly, the invention has the advantage that the user may separately remove the claw fragments or the battery whose life span has been expired so that the user may use conveniently. </p>
