                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A nail clipper designed to trim a portion of the nail of a person&#39;s digit without causing injury to the flesh portion of the digit includes a U-shaped body that has a first and second end and includes first and second, spaced-apart handles interconnected by a central arc portion between the handles proximate the first end. The handles are resiliently biased by the central arc portion into a partially extending, normal resting position. The central arc portion serves as a hinge. A first blade is fixedly coupled to the first handle and has a cutting slot defined in the structure thereof. A second blade is operably, pivotally coupled to the first handle and has an actuator for imparting pivotal motion thereto. The actuator is operably coupled to the second handle. The first blade cutting slot and the second blade form a shearing relationship therebetween, whereby a portion of the structure of the first blade is a safety barrier acting to prevent the presentation of the flesh of the digit to the shearing effects of the second blade with respect to the first blade cutting slot. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates to nail clippers. More particularly, the present invention relates to nail clippers that include a safety shield to prevent injury to the flesh that is proximate the nail being clipped.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Description of the Prior Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Nail clippers are traditionally made of metal, usually steel, and have a complicated structure. Typically, clippers are not ready for immediate use when needed because they must be reconfigured from a storage configuration to a operable configuration.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Further, nail clippers generally lack any safety features. A user may push a nail too far into the device such that flesh located proximate the nail is imposed between the blades. Actuation of the nail clipper then causes a flesh wound. This problem can be especially great when a clipper is used on an infant or on a small child. The finger or toe of the infant and the nail are so small and it is so difficult to see if the tip of the finger or toe is between the blades, yet an infant&#39;s nails must be clipped in order to prevent the child from scratching himself. Clipping an infant&#39;s nails is an experience of high anxiety for a parent. Some parents resort to trimming an infants nails by biting them out of reluctance to use a conventional nail trimmer and risk injury to the infant.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      When either using a clipper on oneself or another, lack of fine motor control can result in injury. A conventional clipper is difficult to use for people without full and free mobility, such as those with arthritis or carpal tunnel syndrome. A substantial force, as well as dexterity and coordination, are often required in order to compress the blades so that the nails can be clipped, which can be difficult and painful for people with hand-related problems. The reduced force and coordination required to operate the invention, coupled with its safety feature, allows children and others to efficiently operate the device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 3,986,257 by Kiura discloses a nail clipper which includes a nail repository between the handles of the device. The cutting edges are located at the far end of the device rather than on the side of the device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 2,616,436 by Langley discloses a clipper with a pair of side shearing elements located halfway between the hinged end and the opposite end of the handles. The invention does not disclose any safety measures to insure that the tip of the finger or toe is not caught within the shearing means during clipping operation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 2,999,506 by Hunt discloses another nail clipper with a side shearing element. This clipper again does not include any safety features to exclude the tip of the digit being clipped.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 3,315,354 by Oates discloses a combination of two traditionally configured nail clippers one of a larger and one of a smaller size, one to be used for finger nails and the other to be used for cuticles. The shearing element is located at the end rather than the side of the device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 4,648,415 discloses another nail clipper with the shearing elements located on the end of the device. That clipper includes a nail clipping repository to conveniently collect the clippings. However, it does not include any safety features.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 3,189,996 by Casey, Jr., discloses a nail clipper with a protective guard. The protective guard in this invention is only utilized for protection during storage of the device. When the device is arranged for use, the protective guard does nothing to keep the operator from being injured.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 3,420,047 by Plaskon, discloses a clipper with side shearing means near the hinged end of the clipper, but providing for no safety means.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 2,043,901 by Willetts, discloses a clipper with the shearing blades located closer to the open ends of the handles distal from the fulcrum point.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 4,819,673 by McMullen, Jr., discloses a nail clipper with a side shearing device and in one of the embodiments includes a nail repository for severed nails. Another embodiment includes a hinged means, the other includes a malleable material means for causing the clipper handles to resume their original parallel configuration after use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      There is a need for a nail clipper design that is easy and safe to use on infants and small children without the problem of inadvertently cutting the flesh that is proximate the nail that is being cut. Additionally, there is a need for a nail clipper that is easily and safely used by persons that lack the fine motor control that is necessary for the operation of conventional nail clippers and affords the maximum degree of safety with respect to the potential of causing a flesh wound.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In keeping with the principles of the present invention, the objects are accomplished with the unique combination of an elastic U shaped body including metal cutting elements and safety guard. The combination of those elements in the present invention results in a device which is both simple and safe to use. The device is simple in that the operator need only apply opposing forces on the handles of the clipper in order to create a clipping motion. The handles only rotate relative to one axis rather than two axes of rotation possible in other clipping devices. Further the amount of force required due to choice of material of the handles of the clipper creates a clipper usable by children and handicapped adults. Another object of the invention is to provide a nail clipper which safely severs nails. Safety aspects of the clipper result from the clipping action occurring on nails which are positioned in a groove of a size and shape adequate to only allow the nail itself to pass through rather than the surrounding skin of the nail. This prevents the operator from cutting the flesh surrounding the nail thereby insuring safe use either by the operator on the operator&#39;s own nails or by another individual operating the device on a second party.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The nail clipper is designed to trim a portion of the nail of a person&#39;s digit without causing injury to the flesh portion of the digit. The nail clipper includes a U-shaped body that has a first and second end and includes first and second, spaced-apart handles interconnected by a central arc portion between said handles proximate the first end. The handles are resiliently biased by said central arc portion into a partially extending, normal resting position. The central arc portion serves as a hinge. A first blade is fixedly coupled to the first handle and has a cutting slot defined in the structure thereof. A second blade is operably, pivotally coupled to the first handle and has an actuator for imparting pivotal motion thereto. The actuator is operably coupled to the second handle. The first blade cutting slot and the second blade form a shearing relationship therebetween, whereby a portion of the structure of the first blade is a safety barrier acting to prevent the presentation of the flesh of the digit to the shearing effects of the second blade with respect to the first blade cutting slot.  </p>

                        <p>      DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A nail clipper of the present invention is shown generally at 10 in a first preferred embodiment in FIGS. 1-4 and in a second preferred embodiment in FIGS. 5-8. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> of both preferred embodiments has two major components; the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body 12</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> blade set 14</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to FIGS. 1-4, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body 12</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> is preferably formed of a continuous piece of plastic material that defines an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> upper handle 16</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lower opposed handle 18</span> joined at a first end thereof by an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> arc portion 20</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body 12</span> is preferably made of a suitable plastic material which exhibits good shape memory and fatigue resistance, such that<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> repeatedly returns to its relaxed position after numerous compressions of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> upper handle 16</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lower handle 18</span> to effect the trimming of a nail. Additionally, the plastic material should be well suited to injection molding type formation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> upper handle 16</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> strengthening upper handle rib 22</span> inwardly disposed along the underside of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> upper handle 16</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lower handle 18</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lower handle rib 24</span> inwardly disposed along the upper side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lower handle 18</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> ribs 2<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">2, 24</span></span> taper from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> arc portion 20</span> toward the opposed second end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body 12</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> tang slot 28</span> is formed in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> upper handle rib 22</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> tang slot 28</span> defines a narrow opening having its long axis generally parallel to the upper surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> upper handle 16</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> Tang slot 28</span> projects into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> upper handle rib 22</span>, transverse to the lengthwise axis of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body 12</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As depicted in FIGS. 3 and 4, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> lower cover slot 30</span> is defined in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lower handle rib 24</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> lower cover slot 30</span> has a generally rectangular opening, the long axis of which is generally parallel to the lower surface of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lower handle 18</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> lower cover slot 30</span> projects into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lower handle rib 24</span>, transverse to the lengthwise axis of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body 12</span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> generally circular spring relief 34</span> is defined between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> upper handle rib 22</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lower handle rib 24</span>, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> arc portion 20</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> spring relief 34</span> removes structural material proximate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> arc portion 20</span> in order to minimize the force needed to bend the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> arc portion 20</span> and to effect trimming of a nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> blade set 14</span> includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span>, an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span>, and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> blade cover 44</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span> are aligned to produce a scissors-type interference cut. That is, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> blades<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> 40, 42</span></span> are not aligned to meet at their respective cutting edges, but rather they interface with each other in a generally flush manner so as to shear off the finger nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> blade cover 44</span> is preferably formed of a smooth plastic material similar to that of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body 12</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> blade cover 44</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> first semi-circular end 46</span>. The arc defined at the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> semi-circular end 46</span> has a decreasing diameter proximate the upper portion thereof, as depicted in FIG. 1. The decreasing diameter results in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> gap 48</span> being formed between the outer surface of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> semi-circular end 46</span> and the inner surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> arc portion 20</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> gap 48</span> is necessary to accommodate the compression of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> arc portion 20</span> when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> upper handle 16</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lower handle 18</span> are pressed together to effect the trimming of a nail. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> blade cover 44</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> squared end 50</span> that is opposed to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> semi-circular end 46</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> generally circular indent 52</span> is formed in the outer surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> blade cover 44</span> to accommodate the insertion of the flesh portion of a digit therein. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> indent 52</span> gets gradually deeper into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> blade cover 44</span> when moving from its outer circumference to its inner circumference. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> generally circular blade opening 54</span> is defined at the inner circumference of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> indent 52</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> blade opening 54</span> extends through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> cover 44</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      An<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> upper cover extension 58</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> lower cover extension 60</span> project inward to the right as depicted in FIG. 4, toward the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body 12</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A gen<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">erally rectangular lower blade receptacle 62</span> is defined in the inner side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> blade cover 44</span>. A pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> blade retainers 64</span> project into the space defined by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> lower blade receptacle 62</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> blade opening 54</span> carries through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> cover 44</span> and opens into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> lower blade receptacle 62</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span> has a generally rectangular shape designed to be held within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> lower blade receptacle 62</span> by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> blade retainers 64</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span> defined therein.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> Slot 70</span> is preferably oriented generally parallel with the lower surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lower handle 18</span>. The length of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span> is preferably at least as great as the diameter of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> blade opening 54</span> and is in registry therewith. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> slot upper edge 72</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> slot cutting edge 74</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> slot cutting edge 74</span> also being the slot lower edge. The outward facing surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span> defines a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> safety barrier 76</span> that keeps the flesh portion of a finger or toe from entering the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span> when a nail to be trimmed is positioned in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span> is preferably positioned proximate the center of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span>. The outer portions of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span> are available to act as the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> safety barrier 76</span> to prevent flesh from being caught between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> slot cutting edge 74</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span>. Additionally, in the preferred embodiment of FIGS. 1-4, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> indent 52</span> defined in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> cover 44</span> and the surrounding portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> cover 44</span> act to further impede the insertion of flesh into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span> where injury may occur.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80"> blade arm 80</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82"> pivot 82</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82"> pivot 82</span> has a bore (not shown) defined therein. Such bore is placed over a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem86"> stud 86</span> in pivotal engagement therewith. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem86"> stud 86</span> is anchored at one end in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> blade cover 44</span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84"> washer 84</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem88"> nut 88</span> disposed on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem86"> stud 86</span> secure the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span> in place. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem86"> stud 86</span> is oriented generally transverse to the plane of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span> so that the pivotal motion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span> is generally parallel to the plane of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      An<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90"> inwardly directed tang 90</span> is formed at the opposite end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80"> blade arm 80</span> from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82"> pivot 82</span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem92"> beveled cutting edge 92</span> is formed on the underside of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80"> blade arm 80</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In assembly, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> blade set 14</span> is positioned at the side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body 12</span> by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> inserting lower cover extension 60</span> into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> lower cover slot 30</span> and generating a compression fit therebetween. Once so positioned, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> upper cover extension 58</span> rides loosely within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> blade cover cutout 26</span> and is not affixed thereto. Simultaneously, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90"> tang 90</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span> is inserted within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> tang slot 28</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span> is then pivotally coupled to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lower handle 18</span> and the pivoting action thereof is actuated by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> upper handle 16</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To use the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> disclosed in FIGS. 1-4, the nail to be trimmed is advanced into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span>. The portion of the nail that is to be trimmed projects inward from the inward side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span>. The flesh portion of the finger or toe bearing the nail will abut the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> safety bearer 76</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> indent 52</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> cover 44</span> and not project into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span>. The person utilizing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> then compresses the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> upper handle 16</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lower handle 18</span> together. By means of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> upper handle 16</span> being in engagement with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90"> tang 90</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span>, such compression forces the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem92"> cutting edge 92</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span> to shear across the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> slot cutting edge 74</span>. The cutting action commences from left and progresses to the right of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> slot cutting edge 74</span>, as depicted in FIG. 1, as the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span> is pivoted downward. Such action trims the portion of the nail that is projecting inward from the inner side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> slot cutting edge 74</span> by a shearing, scissor&#39;s-like action.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A second preferred embodiment of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> of present invention is depicted in FIGS. 5-8, wherein like numbers refer to similar parts as depicted in FIGS. 1-4. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> has<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> components body 12</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> blade set 14</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body 12</span> has an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> upper handle 16</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lower handle 18</span>, and an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> arc portion 20</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body 12</span> is preferably made of a plastic material as described with reference to the aforementioned first preferred embodiment. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> non slip pad 100</span> is adhesively bonded to the upper surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> upper handle 16</span> and a corresponding pad (not shown) is bonded to the lower surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lower handle 18</span> to aid the user in gripping the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> tang slot 28</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> blade guide relief 102</span> are formed in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> upper handle 16</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> blade guide relief 102</span> is downward facing having an opening projecting downward and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103"> roof portion 103</span> overlying the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> blade guide relief 102</span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104"> blade retaining slot 104</span> is formed in the edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lower handle 18</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> blade set 14</span> is comprised of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span> and an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span> is generally rectangular in shape. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105"> blade support portion 105</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span> is disposed within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104"> blade retaining slot 104</span> and held therein by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> self tapping screws 108</span>. The upper portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span> has an inwardly directed,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> generally right angle bend 106</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span> defined therein. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span> is an elongate narrow slot designed to receive the nail to be trimmed therethrough.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> Slot 70</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> slot upper edge 72</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> slot cutting edge 74</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> slot cutting edge 74</span> also comprises the slot lower edge.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> finger indent 114</span> is formed in the exterior surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span>. The finger indent defines a curvature designed to generally adapt to the curvature of the flesh portion of a persons fingertip. The entire exterior surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span>, including the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114"> finger indent 114</span>, comprises a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> safety bearer 76</span> designed to prevent the insertion of any flesh portion of a persons finger into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span>, where a cutting injury may occur.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower affixed blade 40</span> has a bore (not shown) defined therein. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> pivot bolt 110</span> is disposed within the bore.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In a preferred embodiment, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> slot cutting edge 74</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span> is defined at the inward edge of an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> anvil 112</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> anvil 112</span> is an inwardly directed projection that projects inwardly from inside surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span>, extending the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> slot cutting edge 74</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> anvil 112</span> provides structure across which the shearing action of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span> is directed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80"> blade arm 80</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82"> pivot 82</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82"> pivot 82</span> has a bore (not shown) defined therein. The bore of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82"> pivot 82</span> is fitted over the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> pivot bolt 110</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem88"> nut 88</span> is threadingly engaged therewith, holding the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span> in close shearing engagement with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> pivot bolt 110</span> is oriented generally transverse to the plane of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span> so that the pivotal motion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span> is generally parallel to the plane of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem92"> bevelled cutting edge 92</span> is formed on the lower margin of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span>. An<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90"> inwardly directed tang 90</span> is defined at the opposite end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80"> blade arm 80</span> from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82"> pivot 82</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In assembly, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span> is affixed to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lower handle 18</span> by the means of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108"> screws 108</span>. Simultaneously, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90"> tang 90</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span> is inserted into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> tang slot 28</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> upper pivoting blade 42</span> is then pivotally coupled to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span>, which is in turn fixedly coupled to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lower handle 18</span>, and is actuated by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> upper handle 16</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To trim a nail, the person inserts the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> nail into slot 70</span> until the portion of the nail to be trimmed projects inward of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> slot cutting edge 74</span>. The flesh part of the tip of the finger or toe will abut the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> safety bearer 76</span> and thereby be prevented from entering the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span>. It is preferable that the nail be presented to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span> in an orientation that is substantially transverse to the plane of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span>. In this manner, a sufficient portion of the nail will project through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span> and project inward of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> slot cutting edge 74</span> to be trimmed without presenting any flesh to the cutting action of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> blades<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> 40, 42</span></span>. However, if the finger approaches the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span> with an orientation that is from above, a much greater portion of the nail may be inserted through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span> and the resulting cut will trim the nail painfully close to the flesh or may actually cut the flesh. To guard against this occurring, the height &#34;h&#34; of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span>, as depicted in FIG. 1 and the width &#34;w&#34; of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span>, as depicted in FIG. 7 must be selected to present a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span> that is suitably sized to be able to readily project a nail therethrough and at the same time have a sufficient distance from where the flesh portion of the finger abuts the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span> to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> slot cutting edge 74</span> that the possibility of presenting flesh to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> slot cutting edge 74</span> is minimized. The dimensions &#34;h&#34; and &#34;w&#34; also must be tailored for the size nail that is intended to be trimmed. Accordingly, the dimensions &#34;h&#34; and &#34;w&#34; for a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> that is intended to be used for adult sized nails is different from the dimensions &#34;h&#34; and &#34;w&#34; for a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> that is intended to be used for infant sized nails. It has been determined that for infant sized nails the dimension &#34;h&#34; should be between 0.015 and 0.025 inch when the dimension &#34;w&#34; is between 0.010 and 0.025 inch. Preferably, such dimensions will both be 0.020 inch.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      After insertion of the nail into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slot 70</span>, the person compresses the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> upper handle 16</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lower handle 18</span> together. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem92"> beveled cutting edge 92</span> of the upper pivoting blade shears across the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> slot cutting edge 74</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lower fixed blade 40</span>. This action progressively trims the nail that projects inward beyond the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112"> anvil 112</span> starting from left to right, as depicted in FIG. 5, by scissors-like shearing action. As the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> upper handle 16</span> is depressed, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106"> bend 106</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140"> lower fixed blade 140</span> ultimately comes in contact with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103"> roof portion 103</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102"> blade guide relief 102</span>, thereby acting as a stop and preventing over travel of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> upper handle 16</span> with respect to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lower handle 18</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is understood that a number of modifications can be readily devised in accordance with the principles of the present invention by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, it is not desired to restrict the invention to the particular constructions illustrated and described, but to cover all modifications that may fall within the scope of the appended claims. </p>
