                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> The object of this invention is to provide a nail clipper with supplementary functions. In the nail clipper, a folding plate ( 34 ) is rotatably mounted to the rear joint of the clipper&#39;s body such that it is rotatable between its folded position and its exposed position. A housing ( 30 ) is provided at the free end of the folding plate ( 34 ), with a flexible extension ( 39 ) extending from the housing ( 30 ) and designed to be changeable in its length and bent to be curved as desired. A light emitting device ( 31 ), used for illuminating a target place while clipping the nails, is set at the tip of the extension ( 39 ). The nail clipper also has a melody chip ( 42 ) for producing a melody, in addition to having a battery ( 40 ). In another embodiment, the light emitting device ( 31 ), melody chip ( 42 ) and battery ( 40 ) are held on a casing ( 50 ) covering the rear portion of the clipper&#39;s body. </p>

                        <p> TECHNICAL FIELD   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0001]    The present invention relates, in general, to nail clippers used for clipping or trimming the fingernails or toenails and, more particularly, to a nail clipper with supplementary functions of illuminating the jaws of the clipper and producing a melody while clipping the nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          BACKGROUND ART   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0002]    As well known to those skilled in the art, a nail clipper is a device for clipping or trimming the fingernails or toenails, and typically comprises upper and lower longitudinal plates jointed together at their rear ends into an elastic single body through a riveting process or a welding process, with a sharpened jaw formed at the front end of each plate. A lever is mounted to a shaft at the front part of the top surface of the upper plate While clipping the nails, a user repeatedly levers the elastic upper plate down relative to the lower plate to clip or trim the nails by the jaws.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0003]    [0003]FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view of a conventional nail clipper. As shown in the drawing, the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">lower plates  11</span>  and  12  are jointed together at their rear ends through a riveting process or a welding process into an elastic single body, with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">sharpen<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">ed jaw  17</span>  or  18</span>  formed at the front edge of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">each pl<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ate  11</span>  or  12</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">folding nail file  20</span>  is rotatably mounted to the rear joint of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">two plates  11</span>  and  12  such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">file  20</span>  is rotatable between a folded position inside the gap between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">two plates  11</span>  and  12  and an exposed position outside the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">two plates  11</span>  and  12 . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">shaft hole  16</span>  is formed at each of the front parts of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">two plates  11</span>  and  12 , while a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">shaft  14</span>  having a base upwardly penetrates the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">holes  16</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">two plates  11</span>  and  12  such that the base of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">shaft  14</span>  is stopped on the lower surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower plate  12</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">shaft  14</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">hook  19</span>  on its sidewall.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0004]    A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">lever  13</span> , having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">hinge rib  15</span>  at its front end, is movably caught by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">hook  19</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">shaft  14</span>  at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">hinge rib  15</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">lever  13</span>  is normally biased upward by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">elastic upper plate  11</span> , and so it is possible to maintain the movable engagement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">hinge rib  15</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">lever  13</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">hook  19</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">shaft  14</span>  without allowing an undesired removal of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">lever  13</span>  from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">hook  19</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">folding nail file  20</span>  is rotatably mounted to the rear joint of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">lower plates  11</span>  and  12  such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">file  20</span>  is rotatable between its folded position inside the gap between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">two plates  11</span>  and  12  and its exposed position outside the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">two plates  11</span>  and  12 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0005]    In order to trim the nails, a user repeatedly levers the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">elastic upper plate  11</span>  down relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower plate  12</span>  by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">lever  13</span>  with a target nail placed between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">two jaws  17</span>  and  18 , thus trimming the nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0006]    However, the conventional nail clipper is problematic in that it is somewhat difficult for users to clearly observe the jaws of the nail clipper while clipping the nails in a dark area, and so the clipper may unexpectedly injure the fingers or toes. In addition, most children do not like a nail clipping action since the conventional nail clippers do not excite children&#39;s interest while clipping the nails, and so some parents unnecessarily undergo difficulty while clipping or trimming the nails of their children.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a nail clipper provided with supplementary functions of illuminating the jaws and producing a melody during a nail clipping action.   </p>

                        <p>        [0019]    Reference now should be made to the drawings, in which the same reference numerals are used throughout the different drawings to designate the same or similar components.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]    [0020]FIG. 2 shows a nail clipper with supplementary functions in accordance with the primary embodiment of this invention. As shown in the drawing, the nail clipper according to the primary embodiment has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">folding plate  34</span> , which is rotatably mounted to the rear joint of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower plates  21</span>  and  22  such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">plate  34</span>  is rotatable between its folded position inside the gap between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">two plates  21</span>  and  22  and its exposed position outside the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">plates  21</span>  and  22 . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">housing  30</span>  is provided at the free end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">folding plate  34</span> , and is positioned between the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower plates  21</span>  and  22  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">holding plate  34</span>  is fully rotated into the gap between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">two plates  21</span>  and  22 . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">flexible extension  39</span> , designed to be changeable in its length and bent to be curved as desired, extends from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">housing  30</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">light emitting device  31</span>  is set at the front tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">flexible extension  39</span> , and is electrically activated by a battery installed within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">housing  30</span> , thus illuminating a target place.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]    In the nail clipper of this invention, the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower plates  21</span>  and  22  are jointed together at their rear ends through a riveting process or a welding process into an elastic single body, with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">sharpen<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">ed jaw  27</span>  or  28</span>  formed at the front edge of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">each pl<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">ate  21</span>  or  22</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">shaft  24</span> , having a base, upwardly penetrates the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">holes  26</span>  and  29  formed at the front parts of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">two plates  21</span>  and  22  such that the base of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">shaft  24</span>  is stopped on the lower surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower plate  22</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">lever  23</span>  is movably caught by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">shaft  24</span>  so as to allow a user to lever the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">upper plate  21</span>  down relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower plate  22</span> . In the primary embodiment of FIG. 2, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">shaft  24</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">hook  38</span>  on its sidewall, while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">lever  23</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">hinge rib  25</span>  at its front end, and is movably caught by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">hook  38</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">shaft  24</span>  at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">hinge rib  25</span> , thus allowing a user to lever the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">upper plate  21</span>  down relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower plate  22</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">lever  23</span>  is normally biased upward by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">elastic upper plate  21</span> , and so it is possible to maintain the movable engagement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">hinge rib  25</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">lever  23</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">hook  38</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">shaft  24</span>  without allowing an undesired removal of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">lever  23</span>  from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">hook  38</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]    In another embodiment of this invention, the shaft has a lateral hole in place of the hook, while the lever is connected to the shaft by means of a pin, penetrating the lateral hole of the shaft, in place of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">hinge rib  25</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]    In the primary embodiment of FIG. 2, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">shaft hole  29</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower plate  22</span>  is internally threaded, while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">shaft  24</span>  is externally threaded at its neck around the base to form an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">externally-threaded portion  35</span>  engaging with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">internally-threaded hole  29</span> . Due to the screw-type engagement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">shaft  24</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">hole  29</span> , it is possible to control the gap between the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower plates  21</span>  and  22  by rotating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">shaft  24</span>  relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">hole  29</span>  in either direction.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    In such a case, the rotating action of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">shaft  24</span>  is accomplished by horizontally rotating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">lever  23</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]    Since the gap between the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower plates  21</span>  and  22  is controllable by the rotation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">shaft  24</span>  relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">hole  29</span> , it is possible to control the gap between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">two jaws  27</span>  and  28 . A user thus preferably controls the gap between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">two jaws  27</span>  and  28  as desired prior to trimming or clipping the nails. It is also possible for a user to control the engagement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">externally-threaded portion  35</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">shaft  24</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">internally-threaded hole  29</span>  by horizontally rotating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">lever  23</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]    In the nail clipper according to the primary embodiment of this invention, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">folding plate  34</span>  is rotatably mounted to the rear joint of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower plates  21</span>  and  22  such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">plate  34</span>  is rotatable between its folded position and its exposed position. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">housing  30</span>  is provided at the free end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">folding plate  34</span> . This <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">housing  30</span>  has a thickness allowing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">housing  30</span>  to be closely positioned inside the gap between the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower plates  21</span>  and  22  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">holding plate  34</span>  is fully rotated into the gap. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">flexible extension  39</span>  extends from the front end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">housing  30</span> , with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">light emitting device  31</span>  set at the front tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">flexible extension  39</span> . In the preferred embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">flexible extension  39</span>  has a bellows structure, which is changeable in its length and bent to be curved as desired. Due to the bellows structure of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">extension  39</span> , it is possible for a user to lengthen the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">extension  39</span>  and/or to bend the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">extension  39</span>  toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">jaws  27</span>  and  28  so as to change the lighting angle of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">light emitting device  31</span> . In the present invention, it is preferable to set the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">light emitting device  31</span>  at the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">extension  39</span>  such that it emits light to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">jaws  27</span>  and  28  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">folding plate  34</span>  is positioned as shown in FIG. 2. In addition, it is possible to control the lighting angle of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">light emitting device  31</span>  as desired by bending the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">extension  39</span>  and/or by controlling the length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">extension  39</span> . In the present invention, a light bulb or a light emitting diode (LED) may be preferably used as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">light emitting device  31</span> . In order to activate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">light emitting device  31</span> , a battery is installed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">housing  30</span> . In the drawing, the reference numeral  33  denotes a light switch, which controls the operation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">light emitting device  31</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]    In the nail clipper of this invention, a melody chip is preferably installed within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">housing  30</span> . In the present invention, it is possible to use a conventional melody chip, which is well known to those skilled in the art. The melody chip is electrically activated by the battery installed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">housing  30</span> , and produces a predetermined melody while clipping the nails. In the drawing, the reference numeral  32  denotes a switch, which controls the operation of the melody chip.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]    From the above-mentioned description, it is well known to those skilled in that art that the basic construction of the nail clipper according to the primary embodiment of this invention remains the same as that of a conventional nail clipper having upper and lower plates with jaws at their front edges, with a lever mounted to the shaft at the front part of the upper surface of the upper plate. However, it should be understood that the construction of the nail clipper of this invention may be altered without affecting the functioning of this invention. Thus, the supplementary functions of illuminating the jaws and producing a melody may be provided on a casing of another type of nail clipper as will be described herein below.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0029]    [0029]FIGS. 3 and 4 show a nail clipper with supplementary functions in accordance with the second embodiment of this invention. As shown in the drawings, the nail clipper of this embodiment comprises upper and lower plates jointed together at their rear ends into a single body, which is partially covered with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">casing  50</span>  used as a nail piece collecting means. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">battery  40</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">melody chip  42</span>  are set within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">casing  50</span> , with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">switch  47</span>  provided on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">casing  50</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0030]    That is, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">casing  50</span>  has both the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">battery  40</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">melody chip  42</span>  within the rear portion of its interior, while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">switch  47</span> , used for controlling the operation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">melody chip  42</span> , is set on the lower surface of the rear part of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">casing  50</span> . It is thus possible for a user to activate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">melody chip  42</span>  to produce a predetermined melody as desired by operating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">switch  42</span>  while clipping the nails using the nail clipper.   </p>

This nail clipper is also covered with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">casing  50</span>  at its rear portion. Both a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">battery  40</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">melody chip  42</span>  are set within rear part of the interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">casing  50</span> , while a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">switch  47</span>  is provided on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">casing  50</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">Two flexible arms  44</span>  extend from opposite front corners of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">casing  50</span> , and are each provided with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">light emitting device  41</span>  at its front tip. A conventional LED may be preferably used as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">light emitting device  41</span> , and is connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">battery  40</span> , thus being activated by electricity supplied from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">battery  40</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0032]    As described above, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">casing  50</span> , covering the rear portion of the nail clipper of the third embodiment, has both the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">battery  40</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">melody chip  42</span>  in the rear part of its interior, in addition to having the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">switch  47</span>  on its lower surface. In addition, an LED used as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">light emitting device  41</span>  is set at the front tip of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">each flexible arm  44</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">casing  50</span> , and is connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">battery  40</span> , thus illuminating both the jaws and a target nail while clipping or trimming the nails and allowing a user, particularly, an aged person having poor vision, to conveniently and safely clip or trim his nails, particularly in a dark area. The body of the nail clipper of the second or third embodiment has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">projection  48</span>  on the upper surface of its upper plate, while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">casing  50</span>  has a groove at a position corresponding to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">projection  48</span> . The engagement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">projection  48</span>  with the groove retains the position of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">casing  50</span>  around the nail clipper&#39;s body without allowing an undesired removal of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">casing  50</span>  from the body.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0033]    The operational effect of the nail clipper having the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">casing  50</span>  provided with the supplementary functions will be described herein below.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0034]    When the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">switch  47</span>  provided on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">casing  50</span>  of the nail clipper is turned on, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">two light emitting devices  41</span> , such as an LED or a light bulb, are activated by the electricity supplied from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">battery  40</span>  to emit light to a target place. In such a case, the lighting angles of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">two light emitting devices  41</span>  are controllable by bending the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">two flexible arms  44</span>  as desired. In addition, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">melody chip  42</span>  produces a predetermined melody at the same time of the light emitting action of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">device  41</span> , and so the melody comes out from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">holes  45</span>  formed on the upper surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">casing  50</span> . The light emitting action and melody producing action of the nail clipper of this invention excites children&#39;s interest while clipping the nails, thus allowing the children to enjoyably clip or trim their nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0035]    In the present invention, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">switch  47</span>  may be designed to have several modes: a power-on mode, a power-off mode, an illuminating mode, and a melody mode. This <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">switch  47</span>  having such modes allows a user to conveniently use the nail clipper.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0036]    Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0037]    As described above, the present invention provides a nail clipper with supplementary functions of illuminating the jaws of the clipper and producing a melody while clipping the nails. The nail clipper illuminates both the jaws and a target nail while clipping or trimming the nails, thus allowing a user to conveniently and safely clip or trim his nails, particularly in a dark area. This nail clipper also produces a melody from its melody chip as desired. The light emitting action and melody producing action of the nail clipper excites children&#39;s interest while clipping the nails, thus allowing the children to enjoyably clip or trim their nails without being stressed by the nail clipping action. In this invention, the nail clipper may have a cover provided with such an illuminating function and a melody producing function, and so it is easy and simple to change the battery with a new one and to repair broken functional elements when necessary. Therefore, the present invention is preferably usable in the nail clipper producing industry. </p>
