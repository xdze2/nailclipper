                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0001]    1. Field of the Invention   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0002]    The present invention relates to toe nail clippers and more particularly to a new and improved long handled toenail clipper for allowing a person to cut their toenails without need to bend over or stand, many elderly, overweight, and physically disabled individuals have extreme difficulty in trimming their toe nails with conventional forms of toenail clippers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0003]    2. Description of the Prior Art   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0004]    The use of toe nail clippers is know in the prior art. Toe nail clippers heretofore devised and utilized are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed of the fulfillment of countless objective and requirements. Known prior art toe nail clippers include U.S. Pat. No. 4,847,994 to Dunn Jr.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,893,406 to Larson; U.S. Pat. No. 5,357,677 to West; U.S. Pat. No. 5,546,658 to Macleod; U.S. Pat. No. 5,775,340 to Rains.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0005]    While these devices fulfill their respective, particular and requirements, the limitations of prior art is that it requires the user to bend over or stand to function the devices. As prior art in long handle toenail clipper was intended for use by the elderly, overweight, and physically challenged, lack of balance and standing to use prior art, becomes challenging to the user instead of an assisting aid, the aforementioned patents do not disclose a new long handle toenail clipper. The inventive device includes a conventional sided nail clipper having a cutting protion and a actuating lever. A plunger rod coupled to the actuating lever of the nail clipper. A stabilizing arm coupled to the tubular housing A magnifying glass coupled to the tubular housing.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0006]    In these respects, the long handle toenail clipper according to the present invention substantially departs form the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides and apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of allowing a person to cut their toenails without needing to bend over or stand.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    In view of the forgoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of Long Handle Toe Nail Clippers now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new Long Handle Toe Nail Clipper which has all the advantages of the prior art toe nail clippers and none of the disadvantages, for allowing a person to cut their toenails without needing to bend over or stand.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0008]    The general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new long handle toenail clipper apparatus and method which has many of the advantages of the toe nail clippers mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new long handle toenail clipper which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art toe nail clippers, either alone or in any combination thereof.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0009]    To attain this, the present invention generally comprises a conventional nail clipper having a cutting portion and an actuating lever. A cylindrical tubular housing which encloses a plunger rod. A stabilizing arm pivotally coupled to the housing, a locking knob extends through the top portion of the stabilizing arm connector and the housing for selectively locking the stabilizing arm to allow pivotal rotation. A magnifying lens is coupled with respect to the lower portion of the tubular housing disposed above the nail clipper. The magnifying lens has an open end clasp portion slideably receiving the lower portion of the tubular housing. A locking knob extends through the outer end, and lower portion of the clasp for selectively locking the magnifying lens with respect to the lower portion to preclude sliding of the lens.   </p>
