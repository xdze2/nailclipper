                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A hand-held vibrating nail trimmer which facilitates the management of finger or toe nails. The trimmer contains a small electric motor which vibrates a serrated blade placed on top of the nail. The vibratory action of the blade penetrates the relatively brittle surface of the nail, thereby trimming the nail. Because of the flexible nature of the underlying skin and tissue, it will move in unison with the blade and therefore resist being damaged. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The majority of prior art nail trimmers are mechanically constructed and include two opposed blades. The nail is inserted between the blades and a lever handle is depressed, forcing the blades together and thereby slicing through the nail. However, while these mechanical clippers are seemingly easy to operate, problems can arise which would make the utilization of these clippers difficult.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Various medical conditions, such as fungus growth or merely the normal aging process can cause thickening of the toenails. This is especially true for the nail on the great toe or hallux. This thickening makes it very difficult or impossible to insert the nail between the opposed blades of the mechanical clipper. Additionally, even if the nail can be properly inserted, other conditions, such as arthritis or neuritis which might be present in conjunction with the thickened or ingrown nail, would prevent the user from applying sufficient pressure to the lever handle to sever the nail, or cause pain and tissue damage to the user. Therefore, an electrically powered vibratory nail trimmer which would be simple to use by elderly people would be quite advantageous.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A number of U.S. patents such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,544,248 issued to Ashmead; 2,597,526 issued to Kessler; 3,081,782 issued to Funk; 3,596,667 issued to Buercklin; 4,016,890 issued to Fiorenza, Sr. et al.; and 4,177,854 issued to Rosenbloom relate to electrically powered manicuring devices. However, these patents are primarily used to buff fingernails, not to cut or trim the nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 2,131,628, issued to Kohl, describes a hand-held electric vibrating mechanism used for nail care. However, as was true with the above-cited patents, this patent is directed to manicuring, but not the cutting of the nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 3,554,197, issued to Dobbie, describes a portable powered saw which utilizes a blade oscillating about the center of a circle. An electric motor produces rotary motion which is converted into oscillatory motion at the blade. This patent includes an oscillating pivot arm unit using an extended convex blade protruding horizontally from the end of the tool, whereby oscillation is performed by a motor driven spring attached to the blade mounting. This patent is used to cut bones during surgery and would be difficult to be adapted to use as a nail trimmer.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Other U.S. patents of interest include U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,336,017 issued to Fortune; 2,427,580 issued to Stryker; and 3,533,161 issued to Magnin. These patents describe devices used for cutting plaster casts which cannot easily be used to trim nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The problems of the prior art are overcome inasmuch as the present invention is directed to a hand-held nail trimmer utilizing a vibrating blade powered by a small AC motor. A direct drive shaft in conjunction with a connection yoke and an off-center cam bearing provides vibratory motion to a blade containing a serrated edge. The vibrating blade is placed on top of a nail, preferably a toe nail, and is activated to begin the trimming process. The vibratory action of the blade penetrates the relatively brittle surface of the nail, thereby trimming the nail. Because of the flexible nature of the underlying skin and tissue, it will move in unison with the blade and therefore resist being damaged.  </p>

                        <p>      DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to the drawings, FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail trimmer 10</span> which is predominately cylindrical in shape similar to a thick pencil or electric toothbrush so that control and manipulation of the instrument can be easily managed. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> case cover 30</span>, as well as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> motor cover 32</span>, encases substantially the entire length of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail trimmer 10</span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> sleeve tubing 34</span> extends within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> case cover 30</span> for substantially the entire length of the cover. Although the exact material constituting the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> tubing 34</span>, and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> covers<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> 30 and 32</span></span>, can vary, it has been found that a plastic or aluminum material provide satisfactory results.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> Flutes 60</span> are provided in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> covers<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> 30 and 32</span></span> for ensuring that the trimmer can be easily gripped and manipulated.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> Set screws 36</span> are provided to protectively enclose the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> case cover 30</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> motor cover 32</span> around the inner mechanisms of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail trimmer 10</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A 115<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> volt AC variable speed electrical motor 12</span> is provided in the proximal end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> trimmer 10</span> to provide power. The speed of the motor is variable to eliminate friction. The motor contains a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> rotating drive shaft 14</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> shaft 14</span> is connected to an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> off-center cam bearing 16</span> which is used to convert the rotating movement of the motor drive shaft to vibratory motion used to trim the nails. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cam bearing 16</span> is connected to a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> yoke 18</span> positively connected by an elongated,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> cylindrical drive shaft 20</span> which is provided within the entire length of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> sleeve tubing 34</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> Two bearings 58</span> encircle the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> drive shaft 20</span> at both ends thereof to provide efficient operation. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> vibrating blade 22</span> having at<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> least one serrated edge 24</span> is affixed to the distal end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> drive shaft 20</span> by means of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> nut 26</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> washer 28</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The distal end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> drive shaft 20</span> is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> threaded 66</span> to allow mating with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> nut 26</span>, and to ensure that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> blade 22</span> will not become dislodged during operation of the trimmer. An<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> axial pin 68</span> extends through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> drive shaft 20</span> slightly in back of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> threads 66</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> stop member 64</span>. This pin registers with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slots 70</span> of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> registry hole 50</span>. The diameter of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> hole 50</span> is greater than the diameter of the threaded portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> drive shaft end 66</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> blade 22</span> is placed onto the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> pin 68</span> or between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> stop 64</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> pin 68</span> by aligning the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slots 70</span> with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> pin 68</span>. In this manner, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> blade 22</span> will not become dislodged during the operation of the trimmer and any one of the various blade surfaces can be utilized. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> safety shield 46</span> having<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> slots 72</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> registry hole 62</span> similarly dimensioned as the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> slots 70</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> registry hole 50</span> of the blade can be provided either between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> blade 22</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> stop 64</span> or between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> blade 22</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> pin 68</span>. As was true with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> blade 22</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> shield 46</span> is placed on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> drive shaft 20</span> by aligning the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> slots 72</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> registry hole 62</span> with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> pins 68</span>. The function of this<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> shield 46</span> will be explained below.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> standard rotor or round switch 40</span> is provided on the exterior of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> motor cover 32</span> to alter the speed of the variable speed motor and thereby the speed of the vibration of the blade as well as to activate or cease the operation of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> motor 12</span>. The switch is positively affixed to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> cover 32</span> by a plurality of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> set screws 76</span>. The motor is connected to an external source of power via a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> standard three wire cable 42</span> provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> standard three prong plug 44</span>. Although it is not shown, it should be noted that an external source of power is not necessary and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> motor 12</span> could be powered by a suitable battery source.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The transference of the rotary motion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> motor 12</span> to a vibratory motion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> drive shaft 20</span> will now be explained with the assistance of FIG. 3. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> motor 12</span> contains a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cylindrical drive shaft 14</span> which rotates when the motor is activated. A on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">e-quarter inch outer diameter cam bearing 16</span> with a one-sixteenth inch off center throw is provided and retained by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> motor drive shaft 14</span> by a screw (not shown). The cam bearing is provided in a one-quar<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">ter inch inner diameter longitudinal slot 56</span> provided in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> yoke 18</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> yoke 18</span> is permanently joined to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> drive shaft 20</span> by a press fit through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> hole 54</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> yoke 18</span>. Additionally, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> set screw 38</span> provided in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> slot 52</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> yoke 18</span> positively joins the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> drive shaft 14</span> to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> yoke 18</span>. Therefore, when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> motor 12</span> is activated, the rotation of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> motor drive shaft 14</span> is transferred to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cam bearing 16</span>. Since this cam bearing is off-center and works in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> longitudinal slot 56</span>, the rotation of this bearing is transferred to a vibratory motion in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> yoke 18</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> drive shaft 20</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> ultimately blade 20</span> of approximtely 0.062 inch directional in distance. It should be noted that the dimensions given hereinabove are merely illustrative. The present invention is not meant to be so limited.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> blade 22</span> consists of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> three concave shaped serrated edges 24</span>. Each of the three edges contain a different number of serrations or teeth per inch depending upon the type of nail or the condition of the nail to be trimmed. For example, the number of teeth on the outer edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> blade can vary between 15</span> to 32 teeth per inch, although a lesser or greater amount of teeth could also be utilized. Furthermore, a plurality of different blades could also be used.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> shield 46</span> having<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> three concave edges 48</span> bereft of teeth or serrations can be used for safety purposes. As indicated hereinabove, the present invention operates utilizing a vibratory action. Since the nail is relatively rigid and brittle, the vibratory action of the blade will sever a portion of the nail which is to be trimmed. When this portion of the nail has been severed, the under skin or tissue will not be damaged since its flexibility allows it to vibrate in unison with the blade. However, to insure that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> teeth 24</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> blade 22</span> will only be inserted to a maximum depth, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> shield 46</span> is provided. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> concave edges 48</span> of the shield mirror the outline of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> edges 24</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> blade 22</span>. When brought in a side-by-side relation, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> edge 48</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> shield 46</span> should extend next to the top (side nearest to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> registry hole 50</span>) of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> teeth 24</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> blade 22</span>. In this manner, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> teeth 24</span> could only extend a predetermined amount into the tissue beneath the user&#39;s nails. Additionally, each side of the shield can extend to a different relationship with respect to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> teeth 24</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> blade 22</span>, thereby altering the maximum depth of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> blade 22</span> into the underlying tissue.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The operation of the nail trimmer is as follows: Depending upon the particular type of nail which is to be trimmed and the condition of the underlying tissue, a proper blade and shield are selected and are placed securely on the drive shaft and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> nut 26</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> washer 28</span> are properly affixed. The three pronged plug is placed in a standard wall socket and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> switch 40</span> is activated thus creating a vibratory action of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> blade 22</span>. The vibratory blade is then placed on top of the nail and a slight downward pressure is applied to the handle of the trimmer and therefore to the blade. The vibratory action of the blade severs the nail, but not the underlying skin due to the flexible nature of the tissue as well as the safety shield.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      While the described embodiment represents the preferred form of the present invention, it is to be understood that modifications will occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. </p>
