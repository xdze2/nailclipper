                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A nail clipper device with a scissors-like cutting configuration comprises elongated upper and lower operating members each having first ends joined together, and second ends terminating in spaced complimentary shaped cutting edges; a post secured to the lower operating member and movably extending through an aperture in the upper member adjacent the cutting edges; a lever member having first and second ends with the first end begin pivotally secured to the post, the upper operating member having an exterior surface with the lever member being superimposed over the upper operating member in a non-operable position; the lever member having a bent portion adjacent the post so the lever member is first pivoted about the axis of the post, and pivoted in over the post to an operating position, the bent portion of the lever will bear against the upper operating member to move the cutting edge. Each cutting edge of the nail clipper device comprises slanted cutting surfaces and complementary cutting adjacent and juxtaposed surfaces that are moved adjacent to each other and in juxtaposed position with each other when the cutting configuration is brought into cutting relationship. The cutting edges define a space and separation distance therebetween with a first separation distance at one side and a second separation at the opposite side. The first separation distance is greater than the second separation distance. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0001]    The invention relates to a nail clipper device. In particular, the invention relates to a nail clipper device nail clipper device for enhancing clipping of nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0002]    Conventional nail clipper devices are well known in the prior art and used by many people throughout the world. These nail clipper devices typically comprise a lever-like mechanism that applies a cutting force equally across the nail, which is intended to be clipped. Most typically nail clipper devices further comprise cutting units with sharpened edges. These sharpened edges are moved by the lever action of the conventional nail clipper device and abut each other in direct contact with each other. The sharpened edges do not overlap with each other and merely touch at the sharpened edges. Accordingly, these conventional nail clipper devices require increased amounts of force to start the clipping action due to the entire length of the sharpened cutting edges needing to simultaneously cut the entire finger nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0003]    By virtue of this abutting and direct contact, any finger nail being cut by these sharpened edges of the conventional nail clipper device are quickly severed from the remaining finger nail. The part of the finger nail that is being cut is often cut from the remaining nail with such a force that the cut nail is propelled away from the remaining finger nail. The cut finger nail, which is propelled away from the remaining finger nail in unpredictable directions, is not able to be retained and is typically displaced far from the finger. Thus, the cut finger nail is not retained and often lost, which is undesirable and unsanitary.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0004]    Further, conventional nail clipper devices are not well suited for cutting finger and toe nails (hereinafter collectively or in the singular referred to as ‚Äúnails‚Äù) that are thickened, for example nails that are firm and inflexible. These thickened nails can be thickened by a condition often referred to as hypertrophy. Conventional nail clipper devices with the simple abutting sharpened edge cutting configuration do not easily permit clipping and cutting of these thickened and inflexible nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0005]    Thus, a need exists for providing a nail clipper device that does not lose cut finger nails. Further, a need exists for a nail clipper device that acts to cut the nail to retain the cut nail, in which the nail clipper device provides an alternative to the conventional cutting units with sharpened edges that abut each other. Furthermore, a need exists for a nail clipper device that can easily cut thick and inflexible nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   </p>

The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">cutting configuration  25</span>  comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">cutting edge  26</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">end  14</span> B and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">complementary cutting edge  27</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">end  12</span> B. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">cutting edges  26</span>  and  27  cooperate with each other, as explained hereinafter, to cut a portion of a finger nail with a scissors-like action to cut the finger nail form one nail edge to the other. Thus, as discussed herein, the cut nail is not propelled away from the remainder of the fingernail, so that the cut nail is not lost.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0018]    Further, the scissors-like action of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span>  also permits a user of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span>  to cut finger nails that are thicker that normally encountered. The scissors-like action of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span>  starts cutting at one side of the finger nail and the cut continues across the finger nail to progressively cut across the nail. Accordingly, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span> , as embodied by the invention, can employ the scissors-like action to provide enhanced cutting of thick finger nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">cutting configuration  25</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span> , as embodied by the invention, is illustrated in FIGS.  5 +, with only the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">cutting configuration  25</span>  illustrated for ease of illustration. In these figures, each of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ends  12</span> B and  <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">14 B comprise slanted cutting surfaces  30</span>  and  31 , respectively. Further each of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ends  12</span> B and  14 B also comprise complementary cutting adjacent and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">juxtaposed surfaces  12</span> C and  14 C.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]    The complementary cutting adjacent and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">juxtaposed surfaces  12</span> C and  14 C are positioned so that they are moved during the operation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span>  glide next to each other, in a similar manner as conventional scissors. Thus, the adjacent and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">juxtaposed surfaces  12</span> C and  14 C may contact each other in sliding fashion, however, the complementary cutting adjacent and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">juxtaposed surfaces  12</span> C and  14 C do not interfere with the reciprocation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ends  12</span> B and  14 B during operation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ends  12</span> B and  1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">4 B each also comprise slanted surfaces  30</span>  and  31 . These <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">slanted surfaces  30</span>  and  31  and the adjacent and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">juxtaposed surfaces  12</span> C and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> 14 C define cutting edges  27</span>  and  26 , respectively. As illustrated in FIG. 6, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">cutting edges  27</span>  and  26  are provided on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ends  12</span> B and  14 B in a configuration so that in an un-actuated position (FIG. 6) the distance X separating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">cutting edges  27</span>  and  26  is greater at <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">one side  41</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span>  than the distance Y at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">opposite side  40</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span> . For example, and in no way limiting if the invention, the separation distance can reduce linearly across the cutting edges. Alternatively, the separation distance can reduce in an arcuate curved fashion across the cutting edges. These separation distance configurations, as embodied by the invention, are merely exemplary, and are not intended to limit the invention in any manner, and other configurations are within the scope of the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]    The representations of the distances X and Y and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">sides  40</span>  and  41  illustrated FIG. 6 are merely exemplary. These representations are not intended to limit the invention in any manner. Other configurations of the distances X and Y and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">sides  40</span>  and  41  are within the scope of the invention as long as the scissors-like operation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span>  is maintained.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]    The operation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span> , as embodied by the invention, will now be described with specific reference to the benefits of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">cutting configuration  25</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span> . A user of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span>  will grasp the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span>  between fingers and/or a thumb. The user applies pressure to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever  16</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">base lever element  12</span> , therefore moving the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">cutting configuration  25</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">edges  12</span> B and  14 B toward each other while a finger nail is positioned therebetween. The operation that causes the movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">cutting configuration  25</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">edges  12</span> B and  14 B are well known in the art and a further discussion will be omitted.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">edges  12</span> B and  14 B of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">cutting configuration  25</span>  are thus moved toward each other. The movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">edges  12</span> B and  14 B of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">cutting configuration  25</span>  will cause the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">cutting edges  26</span>  and  27  toward each other. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">side  40</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">cutting edge  26</span>  that has the smaller separation distance X will come into cutting engagement with the finger nail first, in a similar manner as the part of a scissors closest to the pivot will cut before the remote (pointed) end of a scissors will come into cutting engagement. With further movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">cutting edges  26</span>  and  27  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">cutting configuration  25</span>  toward each other by operation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span> , the and  27 . The movement, in a scissors-like operation will continue across the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">cutting configuration  25</span>  until the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">edges  12</span> B and  14 B at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">side  41</span>  are in overlapping arrangement and cooperation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]    The above-described operation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">cutting configuration  25</span>  will enable the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span> , as embodied by the invention, to cut most finger and toe nails. For example, and in no way limiting of the invention, enlarged and thickened finger nails can be easily cut by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span>  as <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">the scissors-like cutting configuration  25</span>  will provide a smooth and even cutting.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]    Further, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span> , as embodied by the invention, will control and prevent uncontrolled displacement of the cut finger nail. The scissors-like cutting operation will control the cut nail so it is not propelled away from the remaining finger nail. The scissors-like cutting operation will slowly cut across the finger nail and retain most of the nail cut finger nail close to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span> , so the cut nail is not propelled away from the remaining finger nail in unpredictable directions, is able to be retained, and is typically located close to the finger.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]    The materials of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper device  10</span>  may be any conventional material, such as but not limited to metals, composites, and the like. These materials are not intended to limit the invention in any manner, and further materials are within the scope of the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]    While embodiments of the invention have been described, the present invention is capable of variation and modification, and therefore should not be limited to the description herein. The invention includes changes and alterations that fall within the purview of the following claims.
