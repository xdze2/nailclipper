                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0001]    The present invention pertains to a nail clipper.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0002]    A nail clipper commonly available in the marketplace (as illustrated in FIG. 5) us<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">ually comprises two steel spring pieces  1</span> ,  2 , which have cutting edges, and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">steel piece  3</span> , which serves as a lever. The ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">two steel spring pieces  1</span> ,  2 , which are located away from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cutting edges  4</span> ,  5 , are connected together securely. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cutting edges  4</span> ,  5  are kept away from each other in a certain distance. A hole is opened on each of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">two steel spring pieces  1</span> ,  2  near the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cutting edges  4</span> ,  5 . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">nail  6</span>  is driven into the holes. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">nail  6</span>  has a hollow at its end. The front end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">steel piece  3</span>  bends upward and has a hole on it, thus making the front end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">steel piece  3</span>  forming a crossrail. The said crossrail is rotary wedged in the hollow at the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">nail  6</span>  which passes through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">two steel spring pieces  1</span> ,  2 . While in use, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">steel piece  3</span>  is rotated and the bending part of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">steel piece  3</span>  leans against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">steel spring piece  2</span> . By pressing the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">steel piece  3</span>  which functions as a lever, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cutting edges  4</span> ,  5  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">two steel spring pieces  1</span> ,  2  bit together to trim nails. This kind of nail clippers has open cutting edges and has one end thicker and the other end thinner. It is not convenient for storage. Further, the rotary steel piece can rotate freely and it is dangerous to put the nail clipper into the pocket.   </p>
