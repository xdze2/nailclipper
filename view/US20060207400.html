                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> FIELD OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]     The present invention relates to the field of manicure aids, and, in particular, to a rotatable nail gauge for nail slicers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]     In the United States alone, the professional nail industry is a 6.4 billion dollar a year business,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300"> employing more than 300,000</span> professionals. Fast, easy, and reasonably priced service is a requirement in this competitive market. Customers desire quality service, and one sign of this service is accurately cut nails. As a result, numerous devices have been introduced into the market to cut nails evenly at a desired length, in little time.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]     A number of patents have been issued on precise nail cutting instruments. U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030019120 discloses a cap bearing measurement indicia that may be used independently, in conjunction with, or integrated into a fingernail file or other instrument to determine the length of a fingernail. The invention is designed to allow the user to measure the length of the fingernails, and trim the fingernails to desired lengths according to the measurements taken.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]     U.S. Pat. No. 5,918,375 discloses a nail clipper includes a gauge which determines the length of the nail being cut. The gauge is held by friction against one of the jaws of the clipper, and can slide back and forth to a desired position. The gauge includes a flange against which the fingertip is brought into abutment. In another embodiment, the flange includes a recess which mates with a fingertip. The latter embodiment prevents accidental cutting of the fingertip, and is especially suitable for use in cutting children&#39;s fingernails. In still another embodiment, the nail clipper resembles a guillotine, and a U-shaped gauge member slides back and forth in a holding device to determine the length of the nail to be cut. A finger holder connected to the gauge member provides secure contact between the fingertip and the gauge member. The invention substantially improves the efficiency with which artificial nails can be cut precisely to a desired length.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]     U.S. Pat. No. 6,557,259 discloses a nail having a somewhat V-shaped handle portion formed of a first upper handle and a second lower handle each of which is pivotally mounted with respect to the other, and movable toward the other. A nail holder, having an arcuate slot for the receipt of an artificial nail, extends forwardly from the lower handle. A cutter assembly having a forwardly disposed arcuate blade edge, is slidably mounted and interconnected to the upper handle&#39;s movement whereby it is actuated forwardly over the nail holder to carry out a cutting motion against a nail disposed in the nail holder&#39;s slot, upon the application of force to the two handles and moved rearwardly by a release of the grip of the upper portion. The apparatus also includes an elevation setter which may be used for controlling the size of cut of a nail inserted into the nail holder slot. A sizing tool may be employed with the elevation setter to preset the length of the nail to be worn.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]     U.S. Pat. No. 5,823,205 discloses a nail filing guide is provided for controlling the shape and quality of symmetry of a nail, particularly a fingernail. The nail filing guide comprises a digit rest and a shape wall; the shape wall having an outer contour defining a desired nail shape and a thickness size to accommodate the size of the nail. The outer contour of the wall has an angle established to shape a nail perpendicular to the growth pattern of the nail and a contour to accommodate the desired contour of the nail. Specific embodiments of the nail guides include a pointed contour, a blunt contour, a so-called opaque contour, and a round contour. Extending outward from the shape wall is a support porch for guiding a nail file rested against the support porch.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]     There is a need however, for a rotatable nail slicer gauge that can be installed on existing nail slicers, which will reliably cut nails at a pre-selected length, and is quick and easy to use.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   </p>

                        <p>          [0022]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">molded plastic securing clip  14</span>  has a shaft with a central split running its length, a retention cap larger than the molded main body&#39;s receiving hole connected to the top of the shaft, and a lip connected on the bottom edges of shaft. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">molded plastic securing clip  14</span>  would be pushe<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">d though molded plastic ma<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">in dial&#39;s  12</span>  mounting hole  13</span> , the shaft would then compress along its spilt, and when pushed through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">molded plastic base member&#39;s  11</span>  receiving hole would widen and the lip would catch and secure the base of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">molded plastic base member  11</span> . In alternative embodiments, screws, bolts, pins, rivets, grommets, welds, or adhesives could be used to secure the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">molded plastic main dial  12</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">base member  11</span> . In another alternate embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">molded plastic main dial  12</span>  could be rotatably secured directly to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">nail slicer  20</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">molded plastic main dial  12</span>  is further comprised of a circular center, with six <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">independent molded plastic support arms  16</span>  extending from the circular center, and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">molded plastic gauge member  15</span>  mounted on each of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">molded plastic main body&#39;s <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> 12</span>  molded plastic support arms  16</span> , extending perpendicularly from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">molded plastic support arm&#39;s  16</span>  surface. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">Each molded plastic gauge member  15</span>  attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">molded plastic support arms  16</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">molded plastic main dial  12</span>  has a different length and can be rotatably chosen to calibrate an exact nail cutting length. In alternate embodiments, the number of molded plastic support arms, number of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">molded plastic gauge members  15</span> , shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">molded plastic main dial  12</span> , and the location of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">molded plastic gauge members  15</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">molded plastic main dial  12</span>  could vary.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">molded plastic base member  11</span>  would also be angled on its top side towards the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">nail slicer blade  21</span> , to lower the clearance between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">molded plastic gauge members  15</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">nail slicer&#39;s blade  21</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]     In a preferred embodiment the base member, main body, and securing clip would be constructed from molded plastic. In alternative embodiments these components could be constructed from other plastics, foam, rubber, metal, composites, glass, or wood.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]     Referring now to  FIG. 3 , a preferred method of using the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">rotatable nail slicer gauge  10</span>  will be described. First, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">molded plastic main dial  12</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">rotatable nail slicer gauge  10</span>  is spun around the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">molded plastic securing clip  14</span> , until the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">molded plastic gauge member  15</span>  with the desired length is aligned parallel to and slightly below the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">guillotine opening  21</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">nail slicer  20</span> . Second, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">persons fingernail  13</span>  is placed within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">guillotine opening  21</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">nail slicer  20</span>  and their finger is placed perpendicular to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">guillotine opening  21</span> , so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">finger&#39;s tip  32</span>  rests upon the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">molded plastic gauge member  15</span> . Third, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">person&#39;s fingernail  31</span>  is cut with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">nail slicer  20</span> , while their fingertip remains on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">molded plastic gauge member  15</span> . Finally, steps two and three are repeated for each nail that is desired to be cut at the same length.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]     While the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described and illustrated, modifications may be made by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims. </p>
