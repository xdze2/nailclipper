                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> The nail clipper assembly includes a base having a pair of opposing nail clipping blades spring biased away from one another. A lever capable of actuating the clipping blades is rotationally attached to the base. A housing substantially enclosing the base and lever includes an aperture through which the clipping blades may at least partially extend. A manually actuable button coupled to the housing engages the lever to move the clipping blades toward one another so that a user may cut a nail with the nail clipper assembly. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    The present invention relates to a nail clipper assembly. More particularly, the present invention relates to a nail clipper assembly that provides ergonomic activation of the nail cutters and stores nail clippings.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0002]    Nail clippers are generally well known in the art and are designed to remove or cut off portions of toenails and/or fingernails. Such nail clippers are typically compact and designed to be carried in a pocket or purse where it is readily available for later use. Some nail clippers include additional nail care tools such as a file that can manicure or round-out rough or jagged nail edges. Other nail clippers may include a tip extending or projecting from one end or a side of the nail clippers for use in cleaning dirt or debris out from underneath the nail. Yet other nail clippers may further include a clip for connecting the nail clipper to an item such as a key ring or may include an integral pocket knife.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    Conventional nail clippers are usually made of a solid material such as metal or hard plastic. Such nail clippers typically include some form of a lever or handle that swings or pivots about a fulcrum and is used to activate a pair of cutting edges. The cutting edges themselves are almost always made out of a sharpened metal material and may be concave in shape to better fit the arc of the nail head. The cutting edges are disposed at one end of a pair of spring-biased arms or elongated bars secured together at a second, opposite end. The spring-biased arms/bars ensure that the cutting edges remain in an open position when the nail clipper is not being used. The cutting edges activate through pivotal depression of the lever about a fulcrum that extends through both spring-biased arms/bars and engages the underside of the lower arm/bar near the end having the cutting edges. The lever also rotationally couples to the fulcrum and may include some protrusion or “toe” that presses against the top spring-biased arm to drive the cutting edges into contact with one another when depressed. That is, the user depresses the lever toward the surface of the spring-biased arm, forces the fulcrum upward such that engagement with the lower spring-biased arm causes each spring-biased arm to move toward one another thereby bringing the cutting edges together in a clipping relationship.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    The lever or handle may have a tendency to rotate left-to-right or right-to-left about the fulcrum during the cutting operation. This is particularly problematic because the lever or handle is generally elongated and fails to provide stability against such rotational movement. In turn, this may impede comfort, use of the nail clippers and the accuracy of cutting the nail. A single pivoting lateral lever may even require excessive and imprecise handle movement to perform the cutting operation. For example, the sharp edges of the nail clipper may inadvertently pinch, cut or nick the skin surrounding the fingernail or toenail of the person handling the nail clipper. This primarily occurs due to the misalignment of the nail clipper relative to the nail. Consequently, inadvertent movement of the lever or handle during the cutting operation may cause such misalignment. Poor lighting can also be particularly problematic as the user is unable to align the nail clippers in the proper position and depth to cut the nails without injury. Oftentimes, the nail clippers may extend too far up underneath the nail such that the user clips a portion of the skin where the nail contacts the nail bed. This can be particularly painful and may even cause bleeding. Additionally, the exposed cutting edges may damage clothing during transportation when placed in a pocket or purse. The cutting edges may also have a tendency to damage the interior of a drawer when placed therein for storage. Some prior art nail clippers include a selectively removable guard to protect the aforementioned items from damage. But, the guard itself may be easily lost or become dislodged from the nail clippers during transportation. When detached, the guard is an ineffective preventative measure against damage to surrounding objects or containers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    Conventional nail clippers also fail to retain fingernail or toenail clippings. This is particularly undesirable for purposes of maintaining the cleanliness of the area surrounding where the toenails or fingernails are cut. It is therefore preferable that conventional nail clippers include some means for containing nail clippings. Moreover, clippings tend to scatter or jump randomly away from the cutting edges during the cutting process. This is particularly problematic when a person endeavors to cut their fingernails, for example, in public. It is highly desirable to contain the clippings in order to prevent a mess from forming around the floor, surrounding furniture and other places nearby.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    There exists, therefore, a significant need for a nail clipper that provides ergonomic and safe activation of the nail cutters and stores nail clippings. Such an improved nail clipper should include a compartment for storing one of a plurality of differently sized and/or shaped conventional nail clippers, should include an ergonomic pushbutton that activates the clipping mechanism, should include a compartment for storing nail clippings, and should be easy to manufacture and cost effective. The present invention fulfills these needs and provides further related advantages.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0007]    The nail clipper assembly includes a base having a pair of opposing nail clipping blades spring biased away from one another. A lever is rotationally attached to the base and used to actuate the clipping blades. The nail clipper assembly further includes a housing substantially enclosing the base and lever. The housing includes an aperture through which the clipping blades at least partially extend so a user may cut toenails or fingernails. A manually actuable button engages the lever to move the clipping blades toward one another to perform cutting. The housing generally forms into a compartment for retaining nail clippings. Additionally, the housing preferably includes a pair of sidewalls adjacent to opposite ends of the clipping blades. The sidewalls buffer the cutting depth of the clipping blades and may also cooperate with the base to retain the nail clippings within the compartment. The sidewalls are also preferably configured to prohibit angled cuts and contact of the clipping blades with skin surrounding the nail. This particular feature enhances the safety of the nail clipper assembly disclosed herein.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    The button preferably couples to the lever to permit single plane movement thereof, thereby enhancing one-handed operational stability in view of levers that are otherwise freely rotationally attached to the base. The button preferably encompasses the lever and includes a surface area relatively larger than the surface area of the lever. The contour of the button complements the outer surface of the housing and is ergonomically contoured for one-handed operation. In one preferred embodiment, the nail clipper assembly includes a file disposed on the exterior of the housing. Such a file may include silicon carbide to ensure operational longevity.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0019]    As shown in the drawings for purposes of illustration, the present invention for a nail clipper assembly is referred to generally by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">reference number  10</span> . In  FIG. 1 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span>  is shown in its preferred form. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span>  generally includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span>  having an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">integral ergonomic button  14</span>  that activates conventional nail clippers stored within the interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span> . In  FIG. 1 , a pair o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">f somewhat arcuate-shaped cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  protrude out from within the interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span>  to enable a user to cut fingernails or toenails with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  are preferably arcuate to fit the contour of the nail head. But, the shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  may vary depending on the desired application. The contoured shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span>  is designed to fit comfortably in the hands of a user and eliminate the need to use the clumsy handle or lever, as described above. A simple push of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span>  cleanly and effectively activates the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18 , as described in more detail below. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span>  is safe, hygienic and easy to use. Furthermore, it is ideal for use with active adults, safe for infants and children and easy to hold for the elderly. The width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span>  in particular provides a large surface area and a non-rotatable mechanism so the user may easily activate the clipping action associated with each of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]    As shown in  FIGS. 2-3 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  extend out away from a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">front surface  20</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  are strategically positioned such that a user may only cut off a portion of the fingernail or toenail in one cut. This significantly reduces the potential to over cut the nail. The positioning of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">front surface  20</span>  that encompasses the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  effectively prevents a user from inserting an undesirable depth of fingernail or toenail into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18 . It is the placement of the walls of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">front surface  20</span>  adjacent the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  that prevents the user from loping off too much nail at one time. In turn, this promotes healthy fingernail growth by the fact that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  are able to more cleanly cut the subject nail. Of course, the tolerance between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">front surface  20</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  can vary. It is preferred that such a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span>  be toleranced to effectively prevent a user from being able to extend portions of the finger into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18 . These features make the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span>  particularly ideal for use with infants and other young children. The positioning of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">front surface  20</span>  prevents an extreme angle cut or an undesirable cut in the event of an abrupt move or unexpected slip of the conventional handle or lever, especially for use with a child. In particular, the relationship between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  prevents a user from clipping into the skin or clipping into the sides of the fingers as so often happens with the use of the aforementioned conventional nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]    Also as shown in  FIGS. 1-5  is the ergonomic design of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span>  is generally contoured and is designed to fit naturally to the shape of the thumb and hand of a user. This provides a comfortable grip and enables “one handed” operation. Relative to the aforementioned conventional nail clippers, the user does not have to worry about flipping or twisting any handles or levers with the opposite hand to work the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span> . Furthermore, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span>  is ergonomic in design. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span>  may also include a non-slip or textured surface that prevents the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span>  from slipping out of the hand of the user. The angled position of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span>  also requires less force to activate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18 , thereby enhancing the mechanical advantage of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span> . The width and length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span>  also increases the surface area with which the user may activate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18 . The user will experience even depression of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  no matter where on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span>  pressure is applied. The shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span>  lends to a natural and comfortable range of motion for the hand. The user is not required to maneuver the hand to an uncomfortable position as is necessary with convention fingernail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]    Furthermore, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">file  22</span>  as generally shown in  FIG. 3 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">file  22</span>  is preferably disposed on a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">bottom side  24</span>  so as to ensure free and clear use relative to other components of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span> , such as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18 . But, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">file  22</span>  may be located nearly anywhere along the surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">file  22</span>  is preferably made from a silicon-carbide material capable of rounding out or grinding down sharp/jagged edges formed by cutting fingernails or toenails. The silicon-carbide composite ensures years of filing consistency without dulling. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">file  22</span>  may be disposed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">bottom side  24</span>  in any one of a number of different shapes and/or sizes depending on the particular application with which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span>  is to be used. Preferably, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">file  22</span>  is of an area large enough so that a user may easily file fingernails and/or toenails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]      FIG. 6  illustrates an exploded perspective view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span>  as disclosed herein. In one embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span>  comprises an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper housing  26</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower housing  28</span>  that couple together to encase the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">conventional nail clipper  30</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper housing  26</span>  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">aperture  32</span>  through which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span>  may protrude for fingertip access by the user. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower housing  28</span>  includes a plurality of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">guide bars  34</span>  that selectively slidingly engage a plurality of detents (not shown) in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper housing  26</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">guide bars  34</span>  ensure alignment of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper housing  26</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower housing  28</span>  during assembly. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper housing  26</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower housing  28</span>  may be permanently or selectively detachably connected thereto to form the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">aforementioned outer housing  12</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span> . For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper housing  26</span>  may snap, clip, lock or otherwise adhesively secure to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower housing  28</span> . Permanent securement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper housing  26</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower housing  28</span>  ensures that the cavity formed therein cannot be inadvertently accessed by the user. This is particularly preferred as the housing may be used to retain nail clippings, as described in more detail below. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower housing  28</span>  also includes a set of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">alignment posts  36</span>  that position the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">nail clippers  30</span>  within the interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span> . This ensures the stability of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">nail clippers  30</span>  within the interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span>  when biased therein between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower housing  28</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">nail clippers  30</span>  include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">handle or lever  38</span>  rotationally connected to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">fulcrum  40</span>  that extends through a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">top plate  42</span>  having the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edge  16</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">bottom plate  44</span>  having the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">cutting edge  18</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">top plate  42</span>  is spring-biased relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">bottom plate  44</span>  about a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">pivot  46</span>  opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">pivot  46</span>  positions the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  in an open position as generally shown in  FIG. 6  during non-use. An <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">engagement end  48</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">lever  38</span>  coupled to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">fulcrum  40</span>  enables a user to close the gap between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  by depressing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">lever  38</span>  toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">top plate  42</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">fulcrum  40</span>  actually extends all the way through the width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">bottom plate  44</span>  and has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">lip  50</span>  that engages the surface underneath the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">bottom plate  44</span> . In turn, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">engagement end  48</span>  endeavors to pull the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">fulcrum  40</span>  out from within each of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">plates  42</span> ,  44 . But, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">lip  50</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">fulcrum  40</span> , as engaged to the underside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">bottom plate  44</span> , causes compression of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">spring-biased plates  42</span> ,  44  about the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">pivot  46</span>  such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edge  16</span>  engages the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">cutting edge  18</span> . Release of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">lever  38</span>  causes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">spring-biased plates  42</span> ,  44  to return to a resting position wherein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  are separated from one another. As shown with respect to  FIGS. 7 and 8  below, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span>  is capable of actuating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">lever  38</span>  in the manner previously described.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]      FIG. 7  is a cross-sectional view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span>  wherein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  are disengaged from one another. As shown, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">flat outer periphery  52</span>  (shown best in  FIG. 6 ) that engages a portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper housing  26</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">lever  38</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">nail clipper  30</span>  biases the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span>  out from within an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">interior chamber  54</span>  formed by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper housing  26</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower housing  28</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">lever  38</span>  ensures that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">periphery  52</span>  remains engaged with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper housing  26</span>  such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  allow a user to insert a fingernail therebetween to be cut. Depression of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span>  along the directional arrow shown in  FIG. 8  causes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">lever  38</span>  to depress into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">interior chamber  54</span> , which causes activation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">nail clippers  30</span> . That is, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">engagement end  48</span>  applies a pivoting force on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">fulcrum  40</span> , which draws the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">top plate  42</span>  toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">bottom plate  44</span>  about the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">pivot  46</span> , as described above. This effectively causes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  to compress toward one another to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">contact point  56</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">contact point  56</span>  is where the blades of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  effectively engage one another to cut and remove portions of fingernails or toenails. As shown best in  FIG. 6 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">lip  50</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">fulcrum  40</span>  resides within a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">concave section  58</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower housing  28</span> . This further ensures that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">nail clippers  30</span>  remain positioned within the interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span> . Release of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span>  causes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">lever  38</span>  to push the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span>  back to the position shown in  FIG. 7  such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  release from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">contact point  56</span>  thereby allowing the user to remove the nail from within the cutting blades.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]    The fingernail clippings are effectively captured within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">interior chamber  54</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span> . In a preferred embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span>  is manufactured from one of a variety of ABS plastics to ensure durability while remaining lightweight. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span>  effectively prevents clippings from being propelled laterally by having the walls of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">front surface  20</span>  positioned at the opening between each of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18 . A nail cut off by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  resides within a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">chamber  60</span>  ( FIG. 8 ) positioned within the interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">chamber  60</span>  is positioned precisely to cut down the angle of ejection such that the nail clippings bounce off the walls of the interior portions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper housing  26</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower housing  28</span>  to remain lodged within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">interior chamber  54</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span> . This ensures that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span>  can be used anywhere as the clippings remain within the interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span> . This allows a user to later sanitarily dispose of the clippings. Clippings are removed from the interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span>  by holding the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span> ,  18  pointing downward and tapping the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span> . The clippings then simply fall out of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span> . Simultaneous depression of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">button  14</span>  provides additional space through which the clippings may eject out from within the interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span> . This enables a user to more quickly discard the fingernail clippings in an appropriate receptacle. Preferably, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper housing  26</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower housing  28</span>  are heat sealed such that the user may not open the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span>  to access the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">interior chamber  54</span> . This design specifically ensures that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">upper housing  26</span>  does not inadvertently dislodge from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">lower housing  28</span>  thereby spilling the contents and the nail clippings out from within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">interior chamber  54</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span>  may also be used as a promotional gift item such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span>  may receive customizations such as logos or slogans. The logo or slogan may affixed to any surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span>  such that the logo or slogan is easily viewable when users clip nails. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span>  itself may include a variety of different colors or stylizations depending on the desired use. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span>  may also include a ring for attachment to a keychain or a lanyard via a cutout or other attachment mechanism formed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">outer housing  12</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper assembly  10</span>  is also designed to clip, trim and repair artificial nails and may have alternative uses such as snipping a fishing line.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]    Although several embodiments have been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made to each without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited, except as by the appended claims. </p>
