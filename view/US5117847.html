                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The field of invention relates to manicure apparatus, and more particularly pertains to a new and improved manicure apparatus providing operative association of various components to effect a completed cleaning and finishing of a fingernail in a manicuring procedure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Description of the Prior Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Typically, cutting of fingernails in a manicure procedure effects a dispersal of the clippings in a random and haphazard manner. The invention helps to overcome deficiencies of the prior art by providing a unitary housing to contain such clippings for ease of disposal.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, it may be appreciated that there continues to be a need for a new and improved manicure apparatus as set forth by the instant invention which addresses both the problems of ease of use as well as effectiveness in construction and in this respect, the present invention substantially fulfills this need.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of manicure apparatus now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a manicure apparatus wherein the same provides for a unitary housing in operative association with manicuring components to effect a cutting and cleansing of a fingernail in a manicuring procedure. As such, the general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new and improved manicure apparatus which has all the advantages of the prior art manicure apparatus and none of the disadvantages.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To attain this, the present invention provides a unitary transparent housing including a clipper assembly mounted interiorly thereof aligned with a front wall opening of the housing. A cam and associated cam actuator leg is operative through a projecting actuator rod, whereupon projection of the rod interiorly of the housing effects cooperation of a fixed and movable cutter blade. An underlying tray is reciprocatably and removably mounted relative to the housing to accumulate and permit ease of disposal of fingernal clippings. A modification of the invention includes a basin tray mounting a brush and abrasive sheet to enhance ease of manicuring, and further the basin tray may be provided with a fluid supply to permit directing fluid onto an individual&#39;s fingernail to assist in cleaning of the fingernail during a manicure procedure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      My invention resides not in any one of these features per se, but rather in the particular combination of all of them herein disclosed and claimed and it is distinguished from the prior art in this particular combination of all of its structures for the functions specified.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are, of course, additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present invention. It is important, therefore, that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.  </p>
