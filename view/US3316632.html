                        <p>  THOMAS m i PWM ATTOR N EY United States Patent O NAIL CLIPPER Thomas S. Bowers, 3544 Grantley Road,   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Toledo, Ohio 436116 Filed `Iuly S, 1966, Ser. No. 562,733 Claims. (Cl. 3ft-28) v This invention relates generally to cutting devices and, more particularly, to a clipper for cutting fingernails and the like. Many types and variations of nail clippers are known in the prior art. Among these are clippers having a lever member which is movable from an operative position to an inoperative position for convenience of carriage. In addition to the now conventional clipper where the lever member may be pivoted and folded to a compact position, the prior art includes clippers having a generally channel shaped construction with a lever member cooperating with the channel shaped construction to perform a cutting operation in one position while being movable to a second closed position for easy carriage. These prior art devices, however, have been somewhat awkward to operate. Accordingly, an object of this invention is to provide nail clippers W &#39;ch are simple and easy to operate;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object of this invention is to provide nail clipperswhich are easily and conveniently stored for carriage;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A further object of this invention is to provide nail clippers in which the cover or lever member therefor is moved from a first position to a second position upon normal movement of the thumb when the nail clipper is placed upon the lingers of the hand of the user&#39;and is also conveniently and easily returned to its rst position, again with a normal movement of the thumb of the users hand; and   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A still further object of this invention is to provide nail clippers wherein the housing is of simple construction and in which the cover member of the clipper completes and complements the simple housing design to form a suitable uniform construction (without protrusions) for carriage by the user.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In one preferred embodiment of this invention the nail clipper is provided with a housing member within which is nestled a cover means. The cover means is positioned for movement such that when the nail clipper is placed on the fingers of the hand, movement of the thumb away from the user in a normal manner to apply pressure to the cover member causes sliding movement of the cover member to a closed position for carriage. Also, upon normal movement of the thumb to apply pressure to the front of the cover member, the cover member is slid rearwardly to an open operating position in which the rear of the cover swings upwardly with such movement being accommodated by the position of the hand in applying the opening pressure.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   These and other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent upon consideration of the detailed specification when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 1 is a plan view of the nail clipper embodying this invention;   </p>

                        <p>   FIG. 8 is another longitudinal section view of the nail clipper utilizing this invention showing the clipper in the open or operating position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring now more particularly to the drawings, the cutting device or nail clipper, illustrated generally by the numeral 1G, comprises a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> housing means 12</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> housing means 12</span> includes a pair <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">of upwa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">rdly extending parallel side walls 16 and 18</span></span> integrally connected together by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> horizontally extending base member 20</span>. For convenience of design and appearance, the corners of the housing member are rounded and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> side w<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">alls 16 and 18</span></span> are of progressively reduced height when proceeding from the forward end of the side wall to the rearward end thereof. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> base member 20</span> is of the same length as the side walls of the housing but is provided at the central portion of its rearward end with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> projecting tab 22</span> which is suitably pierced at 24 for the purpose of accommodating a key chain or similar device for carriage of the nail clipper.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> comprises a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> downwa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">rdly extending side walls 26 and 28</span></span> connected at their upper extremities by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> top member 30</span>. Also, the forward end of the cover means is provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> front wall 32</span> and the rearward end of the cover means is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> rear wall 34</span>. The dimensions of the cover means are slightly less than the dimensions of the housing means so that the cover means is conveniently accommodated between the side walls of the housing member and the lines of the cover member complement the lines of the housing member so that protrusions do not exist.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A cutting device indicated generally at 36 is carried by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> base member 20</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> housing means 12</span>. The cutting device includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> lower jaw member 38</span> and an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> upper jaw member 40</span> of generally similar configuration and which cooperate for performing the cutting operation. The lower cutting jaw is positioned on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> base member 20</span> with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> the upwardly projecting cutting surface 44</span> protruding slightly beyond an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43"> opening 43</span> the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45"> front surface 45</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> housing means 12</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> Iupper jaw member 40</span> is positioned on top of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> lower jaw member 38</span> and has<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> a downwardly projecting cutting surface 42</span> which cooperates with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> cutting surface 44</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> jaw members 38</span> and lil are of any general configuration and are here shown (FIG. 4) as including longitudinally extending blades with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> enlarged midsections 46</span>. The upper and lower jaw members differ slightly in configuration in that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> upper jaw member 40</span> is angularly deformed adjacent the rearward end thereof at 48 so that the forward end of the upper jaw member is displaced upwardly with respect to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> lower jaw member 38</span>. The jaw members are secured at their rearward end to each other and to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> base member 20</span> by a tack weld indicated at Si) so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> cutting surface 42</span> of the upper jaw mem-ber is suspended for resilient movement to and from its cooperating position with the lower jaw member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A pin S2 extends through the forward portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> upward<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">ly extending side walls 16 and 18</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> housing 12</span> (and is suitably secured thereto) and also through the forward portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> downwa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">rdly extending side walls 26 and 28</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> to mount the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> with respect to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> housing 12</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Means is provided to mount the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> for plurality of positions with respect to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> housing 12</span>. More particularly, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> side w<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">alls 26 and 28</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> are provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> elongated slots 54</span> which extend at an angle of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45"> approximately 45</span> with respect to the top surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> and in which is received the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> pin 52</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The height of the slots S4 is substantially similar in size to the diameter of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> pin 52</span> and the slots have<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> enlarged sections 56</span> at the forward ends thereof which provide an indexing means for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> pin 52</span>. Accordingly, it is apparent that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> may move longitudinally with respect to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> housing means 12</span> as the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> pin 52</span> moves from one end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> elongated slots 54</span> to the other end thereof.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Cam means is provided on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> in the form of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> downwardly projecting rib 58</span> which extends across the forward end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span>. Since the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> slots 54</span> extend at an angle with respect to the top of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span>, rearward movement of the cover means causes the pin to move forwardly in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> slot 54</span> tending to move the forward end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> downwardly. Downward movement of the forward end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> is accommodated by an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55"> opening 55</span> forming in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> front wall 32</span> of the cover means to enable the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> upper jaw member 40</span> to remain in its open position. During this movement, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> cam means 58</span> rides on top of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> upper jaw member 40</span> and forces the rearward end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> to an upright position extending angularly with respect to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> housing means 12</span> (see FIG. 8). At the limit of the rearward movement of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> the indexing means S6 of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> receives the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> pin 52</span> and forms a pivot point for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Thus, when the nail clipper is placed on the fingers of the hand and the thumb is pressed against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> upwardly extending cover means 14</span>, resultant movement of the ngers and the thumb toward each other causes the cam means to engage t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">he resiliently suspended upper jaw member 40</span> and press the same downwardly so that a fingernail or the like positioned between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">g surfaces 42 and 44</span></span> is suitably sheared. Upon release of the thumb pressure, the resiliency of the upper jaw member pivots the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> in a counterclockwise direction about the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> pin 52</span> so that the nail clipper is again ready to perform another cutting operation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   To move the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> to its forward position so that the nail clipper is of uniform compact construction for carriage, with the nail clipper placed on the fingers of the hand the thumb is moved forwardly in the normal cradle-like sliding motion along a serrated surface S9 provided on the forward portion of the cover means to slide the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> forwardly so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> pin 52</span> is located at the rear of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> elongated slots 54</span>. During such movement, since the slots are angularly placed with respect to the top of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span>, the forward end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> moves upwardly while the rearward end thereof pivots downwardly so that the rearward portion is positioned adjacent the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> base mem-ber 20</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> housing means 12</span>. This pivoted movement of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> is facilitated by the forward end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> upper jaw me<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">mber 40</span> (adjacent cutting surface 42</span>) engaging abutment means in the form of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> shoulders 60</span> provided by relieve portions adjacent the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55"> front wall opening 55</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span>. The resiliency of the upper jaw member tends to pivot the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cover means 14</span> in a clockwise direction about the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> pin 52</span> to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> bias cover means 14</span> to such a position insuring safe carriage.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   From the foregoing it is apparent that a nail clipper has been provided which is conveniently operated to place the nail clipper in its operating position or its compact carriage position without awkward pivoting of the cutting lever, which is common in conventional nail clippers and in a positive pleasing manner. Furthermore, a nail clipper has been provided which is of uniform compact construction, so that it is not subject to damage and is easily carried.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   While only a single embodiment of this invention has been shown and described, it is apparent that there may be changes in structure and operation without departing from the scope of this invention as defined by the appended claims.   </p>
