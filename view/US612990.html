                        <p>  SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 612,990, dated October 25, 1898.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Application filed May 11, 1898. Serial No. 680,352. (No model.)   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To @ZZ whom, t may concern,.-   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, GEORGE A. KIEEABER, a resident of Philadelphia, county of Philadelphia, and State of Pennsylvania, have invented an Improvement in a Combined Manicuring Device and Cigar-Cutter, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My invention has reference to a combined manicuring device and cigar-cutter; audit consists of certain improvements which are fully set forth in the following speciication and shown in the accompanying drawings, which form a part thereof.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My improvement comprehends a suitable mechanical construction of pocket novelty having combined certain details comprising elements suitable forjmanicuring and, if desired7 for cutting the ends of cigars.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In carrying out my invention I provide a U-shaped spring-bar having the free ends curved over to form nail-cutters, the said bar being provided with a hinged arm having at its hinged end a cam-shaped portion for operating the nail-cutters and having its other or free end provided with suitable file-surfaces and terminating in a nail-cleanin g point. Pivoted on the interior of the U-shaped bar is a cigar-cutter blade adapted to be moved over the inner edge of an aperture in the body of said U-shaped bar adapted to receive the end of the cigar. The U or yoked portion of the nail-cutter bar is fitted with a rearwardly-extending piece provided with a pivoted link adapted to receive the end ofv the file-arm to hold it closed, the spring action of the nail-cutter bar keeping the parts under tension to prevent accidental liberation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My invention comprehends various details of construction, all of which will be fully understood by reference to the accompanying drawings, in Which- Figure l is a perspective view showing my improved article enlarged. Fig. 2 is a longitudinal sectional elevation of same in position for use, and Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the cam-frame and file.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A B are two arms of the nail-cutter D. These arms A B are formed of one integral piece bent at C to form the U-shaped bar. The forward or cutting edge D is made curved, as shown, to correspond to the natural curve required in trimming the nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   E is a U-shaped bracket which is riveted at c to the lower arm A and is received in recesses at the sides of said bar A. The upper arm B is free to rise and fall upon the two arms of the bracket, the latterbeing received in recesses on each side of the arm B.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   F is an arm pivoted at f to the free ends of the bracket E and is provided with the camshoulder G, adapted to press upon the movable arm B. In the position shown in Fig. 2 it is only necessary to force the armFdownward to cause the cutting edgesD to approach each other for clipping the nails. The arm E is provided on the underside with a nailile I and also, if desired, upon the top with the match-lightingle J. The end K is made pointed, so as to act as a nail-cleaning blade. The cam G is located upon one side of the pivot f and the extension H is located upon the&#39;other, this latter acting as a means for holding the file-arm E in the position indicated in dotted lines in Fig. 2 when turned over into that location. The spring action of the arm B holds it in that position, so that the main portion of the article acts as a handle by which to operate the file.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   M is a block fitted in a slot b in the bent end O of the U-shaped bar comprising the arms A B, and this block has an extension m, which is received beyond the slot to prevent the bar oscillating or moving vertically. A pin O is driven in position through the block, so &#39;as to lock it within the U-shaped bar, as will be clearly understood.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   N is a ring by which the article may be at tached to a chain.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   L is a link pivoted to the block M and adapted to fasten over the free end of the arm F, as clearly shown in Fig. l, to hold the parts in a compact relation when not in use.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   P is anaperture through one of the arms A B, preferably the arm A, and is adapted to receive the end of a cigar.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   R is a pivoted cutterblade having a cutting edge adapted to move over the inner edge of the aperture P and also provided with the lateral projecting portions r, by which to withdraw or operate it. The rivet e acts as the pivot for the cigar-cutter R as well as the means for holding the bracket E to the arm A.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   While I prefer the construction as shown, it is evident that the minor details might be IOO modied Without departing from my invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   What I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is-   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1. In a combined manicuring article and cigar-cutter, the combination of a U-shaped springbar having the free ends formed into nail-cutters, a pivoted arm having a cam portion hinged in connection With one of the arms of the U-shaped bar and adapted to move the other arm thereof, a lock to hold the cam-arm in position close to the U -shaped bar, and a cigar-cutter carried upon one of the arms of the U-shaped bar.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2. In a combined manicuring article and cigar-cutter, the combination of a -U -shaped spring-bar having the free ends formed into nail-cutters land having a cigar-receiving aperture near the U-shaped or yoke portion, a pivoted arm having a cam portion hinged in connection with one of the arms of the U- shaped bar and adapted to move the other arm thereof, a lock to hold the cam-arm in position close to the U-shaped bar, and a cigar-cutter blade carried upon one of the arms of the Ueshaped bar and pivoted to one of the arms of the U-shaped bar near its free end and movable over the aperture aforesaid in the body of the said arm near the U-shaped&#39; or yoke portion.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  3. In a manicuring article, a U-shaped spring-bar having its free ends sharpened and directed toward each other to form nail-clip-` pers, a hinged arm havinga le or roughened` surface jointed to an extension from one part of said U-shaped bar and provided With a i cam adapted to operate upon the other end of the U-shaped bar to force the cutting edges together, a block iitted into a slot formed in the bent or U-shaped portion of the bar, a pin or key to hold said block firmly in position, and a pivoted link or catch hinged upon said block adapted to lock the free end of the file-arm when the latter is depressed.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   4. In a combined manicuring article and ci gar-cutter, the combination of the U -shaped bar having the arms A, B, terminated in the cutting edges D and in which the arm A is also provided With a cigar -aperture P, a bracket E carried by the arm A and having upwardly-extending portions, a pivoted arm F having the cam projection G and pivoted to the bracket E at f, a pivoted cigar-cutter blade R adapted to move over the inner surface of the arm A adjacent to the aperture P, and the rivet e passing through the bracket E the arm A and the cutter R to simultaneously perform the function of holding said parts together and acting as a pivot for the cutter.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   5. As an improved article of manufacture the U-shaped spring-bar having the free ends curved over and formed into cutters to constitute nail-clippers and having one of the arms perforated to receive the end of a cigar, with a cigar-cutter blade pivoted to the arm having the cigar aperture and adapted to slide 4over the inner face thereof.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In testimony of which invention I hereunto set my hand.   </p>
