                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> An illuminated nail clipper. The illustrated embodiment of the illuminated nail clipper includes a thumb lever including a tab and post attachment section. Additionally, the embodiment would have a bottom clipper portion, including a top blade and a bottom blade. There is also a rivet positioned through a first end of each of the top and bottom blades. A post may be positioned through a second end of each of the top and bottom blades. A cutting region would be formed between the top and bottom blades at the second end of each. Additionally, there is a lighting system that includes a power source and a light source. The light source would be electrically coupled to the power source. The light source would be positioned sufficiently high over a top surface of the thumb lever to project a beam of light over and around a top of the post to create a nail illumination region, which would be located just beyond the cutting area. </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0022]    For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated in the drawings, and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. Any alterations and further modifications of the inventive features illustrated herein, and any additional applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated herein, which would occur to one skilled in the relevant art and having possession of this disclosure, are to be considered within the scope of the invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]    Reference throughout this specification to “one embodiment,” “an embodiment,” or similar language means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, appearances of the phrases “one embodiment”, “an embodiment,” and similar language throughout this specification may, but do not necessarily, all refer to the same embodiment, different embodiments, or component parts of the same or different illustrated invention. Additionally, reference to the wording “an embodiment,” or the like, for two or more features, elements, etc. does not mean that the features are related, dissimilar, the same, etc. The use of the term “an embodiment,” or similar wording, is merely a convenient phrase to indicate optional features, which may or may not be part of the invention as claimed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    Each statement of an embodiment is to be considered independent of any other statement of an embodiment despite any use of similar or identical language characterizing each embodiment. Therefore, where one embodiment is identified as “another embodiment,” the identified embodiment is independent of any other embodiments characterized by the language “another embodiment.” The independent embodiments are considered to be able to be combined in whole or in part one with another as the claims and/or art may direct, either directly or indirectly, implicitly or explicitly.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]    Finally, the fact that the wording “an embodiment,” or the like, does not appear at the beginning of every sentence in the specification, such as is the practice of some practitioners, is merely a convenience for the reader&#39;s clarity. However, it is the intention of this application to incorporate by reference the phrasing “an embodiment,” and the like, at the beginning of every sentence herein where logically possible and appropriate.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]      FIG. 1  illustrates a prior art nail clipper design. Specifically, there is a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> , having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">bottom clipper portion  12</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">top thumb lever  14</span> . The bottom clipper portion includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">top blade  16</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">bottom blade  18</span> , which are held together with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">rivet  22</span>  at a first end, and held together by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">post  24</span>  on the other end. The top and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">bottom blades  16</span>  and  18  for a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutting region  20</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">thumb lever  14</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">tab  25</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">post attachment section  27</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]    One skilled in the art will easily understand the typical operation of the mechanical features of the illustrated embodiments. Specifically, a user will typically force the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">thumb lever  14</span>  downward toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">clipper portion  12</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">thumb lever  14</span>  wi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">ll pivot around post attachment section  27</span> , and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">tab  25</span>  is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">forced against top blade  16</span>  and moving it downward. The downward motion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">blade  16</span>  will eventually come into contact with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">blade  18</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">thus causing cutting section  20</span>  to cut a nail that is placed therein.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]      FIGS. 2 and 3  illustrate one embodiment of the invention in the form of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lighted nail clipper  10</span> . Specifically, in addition to what has already been discussed regarding  FIG. 1 , there is a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lighting system  26</span>  mounted to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">thumb lever  14</span> . In one embodiment, there is an attachment device, illustrated in the form of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">brackets  28</span>  that couple to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">thumb lever  14</span>  and hold the lighting system to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">lever  14</span> . There is also, in this embodiment, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">tang  29</span>  that is designed to specifically fit within the space created by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">tab  25</span>  because the tab is bent downward from the plane of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">lever  14</span> . The purpose of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">tang  29</span>  is to prevent the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lighting system  26</span>  from slipping away from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutting area  20</span> , because many thumb levers are often tapered and would cause the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lighting system  26</span>  to slip away from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">clipping area  20</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0029]    It is noted that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">light source  30</span>  is positioned sufficiently high over the top surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">thumb lever  14</span>  to project a beam of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">light  30</span>  over and around the top of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">post  24</span> . Thus, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">nail illumination region  36</span> , located just beyond the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutting area  20</span> , will be created sufficiently close to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutting region  20</span>  to assist the user to clearly see the nail during a nail cutting operation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0030]      FIG. 4  illustrates a front view of the lighting device removed from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">clipper  10</span> . Specifically, in one embodiment, the lighting system includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">light opening  31</span> , which may be in the form of a hole in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">housing  23</span> , or may be a cone formed from the housing material, for example. There is also a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">light source  33</span> , which may be in the form of a light bulb or light emitting diode (LED), for example. Additionally, there is a power source, illustrated as a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">battery  33</span>  that is located within the lighting system housing. One skilled in the art will easily understand that there is electrical connection (not illustrated) formed between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">power source  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">light  33</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0031]      FIG. 5  illustrates a perspective view of another embodiment of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">light nail clipper  10</span> . In addition to the invention shown in  FIG. 1 , this variation of the nail clipper includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lighting system  26</span>  that is fixably mounted in a groove on the top side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lighting system housing  21</span>  that is fixably attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">lever  14</span>  via a plurality of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">bolts or screws  19</span> . Additionally, there is a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">switch  15</span>  designed to allow users to activate or deactivate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lighting system  26</span> ; and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">cover  13</span>  concealing the power source in the form of a battery. Further, after using the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> , a user may invert the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">lever  14</span>  enabling the top side of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lighting system housing  21</span>  to rest in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">recessed surface  23</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0032]    It is understood that the above-described embodiments are only illustrative of the application of the principles of the present invention. The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiment is to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claim rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0033]    For example, although the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">attachment device  28</span>  is illustrated to be a pair of bendable legs, there are many other means of attaching the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lighting system  26</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">clippers  10</span> . Specifically, and by way of illustration only, it is possible to having the housing integral with the thumb lever, and made of the same unitary material. It is also conceivable to use double stick tape that will stick to both the lighting system, on the bottom, and to the thumb lever (on the top surface). Additionally, one skilled in the art will also understand that the two parts may be joined by welding, gluing, bonding, mechanically fastening, chemically bonding, etc.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0034]    Additionally, although the figures illustrate the lighting system as being roughly a box shape, one skilled in the art will realize that most any shape will be sufficient for the intended purpose of housing the light and power supply.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0035]    It is also envisioned that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">tang  29</span>  may or may not be needed, depending upon the type of nail clipper that is used. Therefore, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">tang  29</span>  may be an optional feature, or could be a removable feature. To make the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">tang  29</span>  removable, it could be attached in a known fashion that allows the user to simple bend and break it off of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">lighting housing  23</span> . Thus, the region immediately holding the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">tang  29</span>  to the housing could be made much thinner than the rest of the tang or housing to promote easy breakage if desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0036]    Finally, it is envisioned that the components of the device may be constructed of a variety of materials, such as plastic, metal, composite material, etc.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0037]    Thus, while the present invention has been fully described above with particularity and detail in connection with what is presently deemed to be the most practical and preferred embodiment of the invention, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that numerous modifications, including, but not limited to, variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use may be made, without departing from the principles and concepts of the invention as set forth in the claims. </p>
