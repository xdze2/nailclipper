                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A nail clipper has an operation grip part pressurizing a cutting edge that can be freely rotated with respect to the body and moved along the surface of the body, thereby allowing a user to clip his or her nails with ease. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> TECHNICAL FIELD  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The present invention relates to nail clippers, and more particularly, to nail clippers that are provided with an operation grip part pressurizing a cutting edge that can be freely rotated with respect to a body and moved along the surface of the body, thereby allowing a user to clip his or her nails with ease.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    BACKGROUND ART  </p>
                    
                        <p>    A nail clipper generally includes a body that has upper and lower steel plates connected on one end parts and opened on the other end parts on which are formed a cutting edge, and a pressurizing bar placed on one of the upper and lower steel plates of the body and thus connected with the body by virtue of a support shaft. In operation, if the pressurizing bar is depressed, the support shaft is pulled by the operation of the lever protrusion of the pressurizing bar, which allows the cutting edges to become in contact with each other so that the nail between the cutting edges can be clipped.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    However, since the conventional nail clippers work only in a manner that the pressurizing bar is positioned in a straight line against the body, a user should turn the body along his or her nails rounded in the arc shape at the time of nail-clipping, which of course makes him or her feel that it is inconvenient to use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    To solve the above-described problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide nail clippers that are provided with an operation grip part pressurizing a cutting edge that can be freely rotated with respect to a body and moved along the surface of the body, thereby allowing a user to clip his or her nails with ease.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    To accomplish this and other objects of the present invention, there is provided nail clippers that includes: a body provided with upper and lower steel plates that are spaced upward and downward at a predetermined distance, having an one end part on which cutting edges for clipping nails are formed, and forming through holes on the sides adjacent to the cutting edges; an operation grip part that has a pair of pressurizing bars, which are tightly disposed on the outer surfaces of the upper and lower steel plates for pressurizing the upper and lower steel plates to face the cutting edges, provided with coupling holes that correspond to the through holes of the upper and lower steel plates and a lever protrusion that is formed on one of the pair of pressurizing bars to correspond to any one surface of the upper and lower steel plates; and a support shaft that is passed through the through holes of the upper and lower steel plates and the coupling holes of the operation grip part that are in a line, for supporting the operation grip part to be axially rotated with respect to the body.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    According to the present invention, the upper and lower steel plates have one end parts that are in close contact with other such that another end parts on which the cutting edges are formed come elastically in contact with each other, in the state where they are opened, and the support shaft is adopted to be passed through the through holes of the upper and lower steel plates and the coupling holes of the operation grip part and coupled with the coupling hole of the one of the pair of pressurizing bars and forms a screw thread for adjusting the length thereof, on the outer peripheral surface thereof.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    According to the present invention, the upper and lower steel plates are supported in parallel relation to each other, by means of a spring, such that the cutting edges of the one end parts thereof face elastically to each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    According to the present invention, each of the upper and lower steel plates forms a guide rail that is extended from the through hole and is passed through the surface thereof, for moving the operation grip part, the guide rail forming a plurality of station holes to stop the operation grip part and rotate it to be perpendicular to the body so that it is compressively operated, on predetermined portions thereof, and the upper and lower steel plates of the body forming cutting edges on the sides corresponding to the plurality of station holes, the cutting edges on the sides facing each other for nail-clipping as the operation grip part is depressed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    According to the present invention, the outer peripheral surface of the support shaft is cut proper for the width of the guide rail such that when it reaches one of the station holes, along the guide rail, and is then rotated, it is fixedly supported in each of the station holes.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    According to the present invention, the cutting edges formed on the body have different curved shapes such that the shapes of the nails clipped are different from each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    According to the present invention, one of the upper and lower steel plates forms a bent portion that is adjacent to the one cutting edge on the sides of the body and bent toward the space portion between the upper and lower steel plates, the bent portion forming a coupling hole through which a coupling member is inserted, the coupling member connected with a stop bar on a front end thereof, for moving forwardly and backwardly in a width direction of the body corresponding to the length of the nail, thereby protecting the nail from coming in the space portion between the upper and lower steel plates.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    According to the present invention, the operation grip part forms on a rear end part thereof trimming lines that cover only the rough surface of the nail clipped to trim it.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    According to the present invention, the rear end part of the operation grip part on which the trimming lines are formed is attachable and detachable to/from the operation grip part.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    According to the present invention, the cutting edges of the body are attachable and detachable to/from the body.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    According to the present invention, the lower steel plate of the body forms a support part that is protruded upwardly on the outer peripheral portion of the through hole thereof, the support part stopping the descending of the upper steel plate when the upper steel plate is descended by the pressurizing of the operation grip part so that the cutting edges of the upper and lower steel plates are in sufficiently close contact with the nail to clip the nail, thereby protecting the cutting edges from being damaged.  </p>
                    
                        <p>  </p>
                    
                        <p>  </p>
                    
                        <p>     </p>

                        <p>    Now, an explanation of the preferred embodiment of the present invention will be made with reference to accompanying drawings.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    As shown in  FIGS. 1 and 1   a , a nail clipper according to the present invention includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span>  having upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower steel plates  10</span>   a  and  10   b , an operation grip part  12  disposed in close contact with the outsides of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower steel plates  10</span>   a  and  10   b , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  for supporting the operation grip part  12  such that the operation grip part  12  rotates with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower steel plates  10</span>   a  and  10   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span> , which are generally rectangular shaped members, are connected on one end parts and spaced by a predetermined distance on another end parts, each provided with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">cutting edges  10</span>   c . The end parts provided with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">cutting edge  10</span>   c  thereon come in contact with each other by the application of an external force and are elastically opened, then. The upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower steel plates  10</span>   a  and  10   b  are provided with a through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">hole  10</span>   d  that is formed in a line with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  on the surfaces of the steel plates corresponding to the sides adjacent to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">cutting edges  10</span>   c , such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  is passed through the through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">hole  10</span>   d.     </p>
                    
                        <p>    The upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower steel plates  10</span>   a  and  10   b  are also provided with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">guide rail  10</span>   e  that is passed through the surfaces thereof and extended from the through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">hole  10</span>   d , for moving the operation grip part  12  connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">guide rail  10</span>   e  forms a plurality of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">station holes  10</span>   f  in which the moving operation grip part  12  stops and rotates to be perpendicular to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span> , on predetermined portions thereof, and the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower steel plates  10</span>   a  and  10   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span>  form a plurality of cutting edges.  10   g  on the sides corresponding to the plurality of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">station holes  10</span>   f , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">cutting edges  10</span>   g  facing each other for nail-clipping as the operation grip part  12  is depressed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">guide rail  10</span>   e  is relatively a small passage enough to guide the outer peripheral surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  that is cut on the face thereof to have a generally small diameter, and when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  reaches one of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">station holes  10</span>   f , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">corresponding station hole  10</span>   f  serves to rotate the operation grip part  12  such that the outer peripheral surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  having a generally large diameter is located toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">guide rail  10</span>   e , thereby preventing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  from moving.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">cutting edges  10</span>   c  and log on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span>  have such the shape and strength that they clip a corresponding nail or toenail by the only one operation of the operation grip part  12 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    As shown in  FIG. 2 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">cutting edges  10</span>   h  on the front end part and the sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span>  are formed in various curved shapes such that the shapes of the nails clipped are different from each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  is formed passing through the coupling hole (not shown) of the operation grip part  12  and the through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">hole  10</span>   d  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span>  so that the operation grip part  12  is axially rotatable with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  is provided with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">screw thread  14</span>   a  on the outer peripheral surface thereof such that it is passed through a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">pressurizing bar  12</span>   a  of the operation grip part  12  on which a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lever protrusion  12</span>   c  is formed, and it is coupled with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">screw thread  14</span>   a  to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">pressurizing bar  12</span>   b  of the operation grip part  12  on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">which lever protrusion  12</span>   c  is not formed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    In this case, in order to prevent the gap between the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower steel plates  10</span>   a  and  10   b  from being substantially narrowed as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  moves to a rear end part of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span>  along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">guide rail  10</span>   e , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  is appropriately fastened and loosed such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">pressurizing bars  12</span>   a  and  12   b  can be tightly closed on each surface of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower steel plates  10</span>   a  and  10   b.     </p>
                    
                        <p>    The operation grip part  12  has the pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">pressurizing bars  12</span>   a  and  12   b  that are tightly disposed on the outer surfaces of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower steel plates  10</span>   a  and  10   b , the coupling holes (not shown) that are in a straight line with the through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">holes  10</span>   d  of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower steel plates  10</span>   a  and  10   b  on the front end parts thereof, and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lever protrusion  12</span>   c  that is formed on one of the pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">pressurizing bars  12</span>   a  and  12   b , so as to pull the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  upon operation of the operation grip part  12  and to face the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">cutting edges  10</span>   c  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span>  each other at the same time.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  is directly passed through the coupling hole of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">pressurizing bar  12</span>   a  on which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lever protrusion  12</span>   c  is formed, and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">screw thread  14</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  is coupled with the coupling hole of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">pressurizing bar  12</span>   b  on which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lever protrusion  12</span>   c  is not formed, which allows the length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  to be adjusted, while making the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">pressuring bars  12</span>   a  and  12   b  of the operation grip part  12  come in contact with the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower steel plates  10</span>   a  and  10   b.     </p>
                    
                        <p>    In the state that a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">cutting edge  22</span>  of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">body  20</span>  is separated from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">body  20</span> , as shown in  FIG. 3 , it can be attachable and detachable to/from the front end part of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">body  20</span> . This is achieved by forming a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">coupling groove  22</span>   a  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">cutting edge  22</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">coupling protrusion  20</span>   a  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">body  20</span> , so that they are attached and detached each other. At that time, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">coupling protrusion  20</span>   a  is in the shape of a regular triangle and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">coupling groove  22</span>   a  is in the shape of a reverse triangle, strongly engaged each other to prevent their separation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    As shown in  FIG. 4 , a rear end part of the opera<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">tion grip part  30  forms trimming line  30</span>   a  that takes a generally one fourth arc shape to cover only the rough surface of the nail clipped for trimming it.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    In case of trimming the cut face of the nail clipped, as shown in  FIG. 4   a , only the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">rear  200</span>  end part  34  of an operation grip part  32  on which a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">trimming line  30</span>   a  is formed is separated. That is, the rear end part  34  is attachable and detachable to/from the operation grip part  32 , such that the nail trimming is carried out with ease. In this case, the coupling of the rear end part  34  with the operation grip part  32  is achieved by means of a bonding part  36  such as a magnet that is provided on the surfaces corresponding to each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    On the other hand, the one end parts of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lower steel plates  10</span>   a  and  10   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span>  are connected in a welding manner and the another end parts thereof face each other by the elasticity of the steel plate and are then separated by a predetermined distance. Besides, as shown in  FIGS. 5 and 6 , upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">lower steel plates  40</span>   a  and  40   b  of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">body  40</span>  are disposed in parallel relation to each other and between the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">lower steel plates  40</span>   a  and  40   b  is provided with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">spring  42</span>  that enables a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">cutting edge  40</span>   c  to be elastically operated if an operation grip part  44  is depressed. In case of installing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">spring  42</span> , the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">lower steel plates  40</span>   a  and  40   b  are in parallel relation to each other such that when a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">support shaft  46</span>  is moved along a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">guide rail  40</span>   d  for using the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">cutting edges  40</span>   e  on the sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">body  40</span> , it does not need to be adjusted in length. In this case, therefore, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">support shaft  46</span>  with no screw thread thereon is desirably employed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    As shown in  FIG. 7 , an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">upper steel plate  53</span>  forms a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">bent portion  56</span>  that is adjacent to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">one cutting edge  52</span>  on the sides of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">lower steel plates  53</span>  and  54  of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">body  50</span>  and located toward the space portion between the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">lower steel plates  53</span>  and  54 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">bent portion  56</span>  forming a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">coupling hole  56</span>   a  through which a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">coupling member  58</span>  is inserted, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">coupling member  58</span>  connected with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">stop bar  59</span>  on a front end thereof, for moving forwardly and backwardly in a width direction of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">body  50</span>  corresponding to the length of the nail thereby protecting the nail from coming in the space portion between the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">lower steel plates  53</span>  and  54 . In this case, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">stop bar  59</span>  may be arranged corresponding to each of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">cutting edges  52</span> , or may be formed for only the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">single cutting edge  52</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    As shown in  FIGS. 8 and 8   a , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">lower steel plate  62</span>  of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">body  60</span>  forms a support part  66  that is protruded upwardly on the outer peripheral portion of a through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">hole  62</span>   a  thereof, the support part  66  stopping the descending of an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem63">upper steel plate  63</span>  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem63">upper steel plate  63</span>  is descended by the pressurizing of an operation grip part  64  so that the cutting edges are in sufficiently close contact with the nail to clip the nail, thereby protecting the cutting edges from being damaged.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Under the above-mentioned configurations of the nail clippers according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, in case of nail-clipping by using the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">cutting edges  10</span>   c  formed on the one end parts of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span> , the operation grip part  12  is in parallel relation to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span>  and as the operation grip part  12  is depressed, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">cutting edges  10</span>   c  face each other and clip the desired nail. In case of clipping the edge portions of the nail, the operation grip part  12  rotates to an appropriate position with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span> , without facing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span>  itself toward the edge portions of the nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    In case of using the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">cutting edges  10</span>   g  formed on the sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span> , the operation grip part  12  is in parallel relation to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span>  and then, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  is moved along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">guide rail  10</span>   e  to a position where the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">desired cutting edge  10</span>   g  is placed. When the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  reaches the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">corresponding station hole  10</span>   f , the operation grip part  12  is rotated and placed in a perpendicular line to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span> , and at this state, the clipping is achieved. While the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  is moved along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">guide rail  10</span>   e , the outer peripheral surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  having the relatively small diameter is moved toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">guide rail  10</span>   e , and on the contrary, if it reaches the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">corresponding station hole  10</span>   f , the outer peripheral surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  having the relatively large diameter is moved toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">guide rail  10</span>   e , such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support shaft  14</span>  is not moved to the side portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">station hole  10</span>   f.     </p>
                    
                        <p>    As the operation grip part  12  is moved along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">guide rail  10</span>   e  to a desired position, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">cutting edge  10</span>   g  corresponding to the desired position serves to clip the desired nail. And, since the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">cutting edges  22</span>  that are formed on the one end parts of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">body  20</span>  are attachable and detachable to/from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">body  20</span> , they can be exchanged into new ones any time, and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">trimming line  30</span>   a  that is formed on the rear end part of the operation grip part  3 D serves to trim the cut face of the nail clipped in an accurate manner.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY  </p>
