                        <p>  IMPROVEMENT IN SCISSORS.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Specification forming part of Letters Patent N0. `138,061, dated April 22, 1873; application filed October 9, 1872.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, AMos WHLTTEMORE, of Gambridgeport, in the county of Middlesex and State of Massachusetts, have invented Improvements in Right-and-Left-Hand Scissors and I do hereby declare that the followingis afull, clear, and exact description thereof, reference being had to the accompanying drawingmalring part of this speciication,iu which- Figure 1 is a side view of the scissors. Fig. 2 is a section through dotted line y. Fig. 3 is a section through dotted line x. y   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Similar letters of reference indicate corresponding parts in the several figures.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The object of my invention is to construct a pair of scissors so that they can be conveniently used in either the right or left hand, thus adapting them for trimming and cleaning finger-nails, as will be hereinafter explained.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The following description of my invention will enable others skilled in the art to understand it.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the accompanying drawing, A A represent the two limbs of the scissors, which are pivoted together at o and constructed with the usual cuttingedges b b forward ofthe pivot c. In addition to the cuttingedges b b there are two other cutting-edges, a af, in rear of the pivot c, which may be curved or straight, and which are so formed, relatively to the cutting edges b b&#39;, that when the scissors are used in.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  the left handv these edges a a will be pressed together in precisely the same manner as the cutting-edges b b will be when the scissors are used in the right hand.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In Fig. 1 of the drawing I have represented the scissors with points which are short, but in practice I prefer to have these points blunt, as a precaution again st injury to the person or clothes.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   For the purpose of adapting the scissors for cleaning linger nails, I construct the outer edges of the two rear blades with curved edges Mfor receiving the cushions ofthe fingers, terminating in points g g for cleaning the nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   For the purpose of preventing the rings of the blades. from crossing, a stop, d, may be used; or, if desirable, the finger rings may be bent so as to be in the same plane, which will answer just as well as the stop d.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  It will thus be seen that I have a pair of scissors which can be used just as well in the left hand as in the right, thereby adapting them for trimming the nger-nails of both hands.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having described my invention, whatI claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, 1s-   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1. The cutting-edges a a combined with the cutting-edges b b&#39;, substantially in the manner and for the purpose described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2. The curved edges c&#39;, terminating in cleaning-points g, substantially as described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Witnesses AMOS WHITTEMORE.   </p>
