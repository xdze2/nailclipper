                        <p>  SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 293,718, dated FebruarylQ, 1884.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  I Application filed May 19, 1883. (No model.)   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To aZZ whom it&#39;mcty concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, ALLISON N. CLARK, a citizen of the United States, residing at Plainville, in the county of Hartford and State of Connecticut, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Pocket Implements, of which the following is aspecification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My invention relates to an improvement in pocket implements; and the objects of my invention are to furnish a neat, cheap, and convenient set of tools, all in one implement, for carrying in the pocket, which tools will be hereinafter specifically described. I attain these objects by the construction illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which- Figure 1 is a side elevation of my improvement with the parts arranged in position for carrying in the pocket. Fig. 2 is a like view of the same with the parts represented in position ready for use in cleaning ones fingernails. Fig. 3 is a like View of the same imple ment with the parts adjusted for use as an earspoon. Fig. 4- is an edge view with the parts in the same position as in Fig. 3. Fig. 5 is a longitudinal section on line w 00 of Fig. 1, with the parts represented in the same position as in said Fig. 1. Fig. 6 is a plan view of the tweezer-blank. Fig. 7 is a detached plan view of the ear-spoon, file, and nail-cleaner. Fig.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  8 is a plan view of the sliding block employed,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  in connecting the parts, and Fig. 9 is a plan view of a slide bearing a knife upon its outer end instead of an ear-spoon. Figs. 6, 7,8, and 9 are represented upon a scale half as large as that employed in the preceding figures.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  I first blank out the body of the instrument and the tweezer-blades a in the form shown in Fig. 6,- after which I bend said blank near the middle of its length into the form represented in those figures which precede Fig. 6, leavinga sort of U-shaped bend at one end, and a pair of blades, a a, which form spring-tweezers at the opposite end. .The U-shaped end I bevel off by grinding or polishing, substantially as shown, so as to bring it to a cutting-edge at one side and form the nail-cutter b. The body of the implement is slotted, as shown at c c.- The slide A is formed with the ear-spoon d at oneIend, as shown in Fig. 7, with two points, 6, for a finger-nail cleaner at the other end, and with toothed or roughened edges f for a nail-file. It is also provided with a slot to re- &#39;parts in place and leave the slide A free to move back and forth the -whole length of the slots 0 c. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> block 9</span>, being thicker than the body of the slide Aand entering the slot 0 c,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  willhold said slide in longitudinal alignment with the rest of the implement.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   For placing in ones pocket, the slide is moved so as to bring the ear-spoon and nailcleaner into the position represented in Fig.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1, so that neither will protrude beyond the tweezer-blades or the body of the implement. The nail-cutter is free to be used at any time. By moving the slide Atoward the nail-cutter,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  the points of the nail-cleaner will project, as 1 shown in&#39; Fig. 2, ready for use. The springtweezers are ready for use when the slide A is in the position shown in Fig. 2, or when it is in the position represented in Figs. 1 and 5. By sliding the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> block 9</span> and parts attached thereto toward the end of thetweezer-blades, the caps h it close the ends of the blades upon the body of the slide A, while the ear-spoon projects, as shown &#39;in&#39; Figs. 3 and 4., thereby bringing the blades into such position as not to interfere with the convenient use of the earspoon. Then the ear-spoon is drawn in between the blades again, they spring open as be fore, ready for use.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   While I consider it preferable to construct both tweezer-blades and the nail-cutter all in one and the same piece of metal in the manner herein shown and described, they may be constructed of separate pieces and secured together, so as to form when completed an implement capable of all the uses of that herein shown and described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  If desired, instead of the slide A, having the ear-spoond and nail-cleaners e e, the slide shown in Fig. 9, having a knife-blade, a, of any desired form, may be substituted therefor to act in connection with the tweezer-blades, as hereinbefore described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   I am aware that a prior patent shows tweez ers having a knife or tool with a slotted shank,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  IOU   </p>
                    
                        <p>  which is arranged to slide longitudinally between the shanks of the twcczer-blades, so as to project the point of the tool from the shank of the tweezers, and Ihereby disclaim the same.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  I claim as my invention- 1. The herein-described pocket implement, consisting of the spring-tweezers, the nail-cutter, the nail-cleaner, file, and ear-spoon, arranged to slide between the body of the tweez ers, substantially as described,and for the purpose specified.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2. The combination of the spring-tweezers having slotted blades, the slide having a suitable tool at the end, which is adapted to be projected from the tweezer end of the blades, suitable projections rigidly connected to said slide and extending through the slotted blades, and caps at the ends of said proiections,whieh move with the slide and close the springblades upon the slide when said slide is pro jected, substantially as described, and for the purpose specified.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   3. The combination of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">tweezer-blades (1</span>, having longitudinal slot 0, the ear-spoon (Z, and nail-cleaner 0, arranged to slide between the slotted blades, substantially as described, and for the purpose specified.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   4. The spring-tweezers having a U-shaped portion at one end, sharpened upon the edge to form a nail-cutter, substantially as described, and for the purpose specified.   </p>
