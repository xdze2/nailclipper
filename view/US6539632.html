                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates to toe nail clippers and more particularly to a new and improved long handled toenail clipper for allowing a person to cut their toenails without need to bend over or stand. Many elderly, overweight, and physically disabled individuals have extreme difficulty in trimming their toe nails with conventional forms of toenail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Description of the Prior Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The use of toe nail clippers is known in the prior art. Toe nail clippers heretofore devised and utilized are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements. Known prior art toe nail clippers include U.S. Pat. No. 4,847,994 to DunnJr.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,893,406 to Larson; U.S. Pat. No. 5,357,677 to West; U.S. Pat. No. 5,546,658 to Macleod; U.S. Pat. No. 5,775,340 to Rains.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      While these devices fulfill their respective, particular requirements, the limitations of the prior art is that it requires the user to bend over or stand to operate the devices. As the prior art in long handle toenail clippers was intended for use by the elderly, overweight, and physically challenged, lack of balance, the necessity of and standing to use the prior art becomes challenging to the user. Instead of an assisting aid, the aforementioned patents do not disclose a new long handle toenail clipper. The device of the instant invention includes a conventional sided nail clipper having a cutting portion and an actuating lever; a plunger rod coupled to the actuating lever of the nail clipper; a stabilizing arm coupled to a tubular housing; and a magnifying glass coupled to the tubular housing.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In these respects, the long handle toenail clipper according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of allowing a person to cut their toenails without needing to bend over or stand.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of Long Handle Toe Nail Clippers now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new Long Handle Toe Nail Clipper which has all the advantages of the prior art toe nail clippers and none of the disadvantages by allowing a person to cut their toenails without needing to bend over or stand.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new long handle toenail clipper apparatus and method which has many of the advantages of the toe nail clippers mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new long handle toenail clipper which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art toe nail clippers, either alone or in any combination thereof.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To attain this, the present invention generally comprises a conventional nail clipper having a cutting portion and an actuating lever; a cylindrical tubular housing which encloses a plunger rod; a stabilizing arm pivotally coupled to the housing; and a locking knob extending through the top portion of the stabilizing arm connector and the housing for selectively locking the stabilizing arm to allow pivotal rotation. A magnifying lens is coupled with respect to the lower portion of the tubular housing disposed above the nail clipper. The magnifying lens has an open end clasp portion slidably receiving the lower portion of the tubular housing. A locking knob extends through the outer end and lower portion of the clasp for selectively locking the magnifying lens with respect to the lower portion to preclude sliding of the lens.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawing. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways.

At the bottom of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">elongated body  20</span>  is a leaf spring type toenail clipper having a pair of parall<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">el spaced spring steel cutting portions  26</span>  and  34  which are connected by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">pin  50</span>  which allows the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">cutting portions  26</span>  and  34  to be moved together and apart. An <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">actuating lever  32</span>  is connected in conventional fashion to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">pin  50</span>  for the purpose of trimming the toenail. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">sided flange  24</span>  on each side of the clipper retains nail clippings. When <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">plunger rod  28</span>  is pushed downwardly, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">clipper cutting jaws  26</span>  and  34  are forced together cutting a nail placed between the jaws, in a manner well known in the art.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Pivotally mounted adjacent the rear end of the clipper is a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">stabilizing arm  30</span>  connected and secured with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">lock knob  36</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">magnifying glass  22</span>  may be slidably mounted on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">elongated body  20</span>  to provide a magnified image of the toe and clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIG. 2 is a top plan view of the nail clipper illustrating the wrap-around feature of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">magnifying glass  22</span>  secured with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">lock knob  44</span>  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">elongated body  20</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIG. 3 is a schematic top view of the nail clipper apparatus showing the pivotal aspect of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">stabilizing arm  30</span>  attached to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">elongated body  20</span>  with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">lock knob  36</span> .  </p>
