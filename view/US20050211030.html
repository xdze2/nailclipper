                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> Provided herein is an illuminating nail clipper for clipping the nails of an animal such as a dog, cat, bird, or the like which allows for the clipping of an individual nail at the desired length to prevent injury or improper length cutting for the animal. The device includes a hand-actuated clipping blade used in conjunction with an adjustable in size nail holder which includes a cutting hole and which allows the nail to be clipped to be firmly held at a particular position relative to the nail cutting blade. Using an appropriate diameter aperture of the cutting hole, the animal nail may be inserted in an aperture of size sufficient to permit the nail to penetrate a particular distance based on the diameter size of the nail, which is tapered. A light source disposed on a flexible arm or conduit can be provided to illuminate an animal&#39;s nail to make it translucent, allowing the operator to see the capillaries within the nail and thus to avoid cutting to the live portion of the nail. In addition, the invention includes a comfortable, ergonomic grip which allows the handles to rest more comfortably and securely in the operator&#39;s hand. </p>

                        <p> TECHNICAL FIELD   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]     This invention relates to instruments useful in the grooming and maintenance of animals. More particularly, it relates to an improved nail clipper useful in controlling the length of keratinous growths, including without limitation nails and claws on dogs and cats, and talons of various birds.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]     Professional quality animal nail clippers used by both veterinarians and animal owners in trimming the nails of animals, such as those of dogs and cats, have been successfully made and sold for over forty years under the trademark ‚ÄúRESCO‚Äù by Tecla Company, Incorporated of Walled Lake, Mich. Such clippers were initially made in accordance with the principles and features of the Laing U.S. Pat. No. 2,955,354 and later pursuant to the improvements of the Clark U.S. Pat. No. 3,838,507, both incorporated herein by reference. More recently a nail clipper of this type has been successfully modified for use in clipping human artificial fingernails by employing the principles and features of the Reiswig U.S. Pat. No. 4,856,190, also incorporated herein by reference. Other prior art patents of general interest directed to guillotine-type cutters and clippers are disclosed in the following U.S. patents, the entirety of all of which are herein incorporated by reference: U.S. Pat. Nos. 165,402; 205,088; 1,347,651; 1,927,234; 2,820,292; 2,955,354; 3,101,535; 3,299,505; 3,430,340; 3,838,507; 3,845,553; 3,855,699; 3,903,596; 4,228,585; 4,449,297; 4,856,190; 5,065,513; 5,101,563; 5,123,430; and 5,533,363 all of which are herein incorporated by reference.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]     During the course of the use of a nail clipper of the prior art, the groomer typically locates the cutting jaws, blades or other cutting means about the nail which is desired to be trimmed, and actuates the cutting mechanism of the clipper, often by squeezing the handles on the clipper device. However, the nail includes not only the dead portion which is desired to be trimmed off of the animal, but also includes a live root portion from which the nail grows, which root portion includes various tissues, including blood vessels and nerves. Owing to the variability across species of the amount which the root protrudes from the limb of the animal, it is not uncommon during a nail trimming procedure for the groomer to inadvertently cut into the root portion, causing pain to the animal, in addition to bleeding and the possibility of infection of the wound so created, which is an inherent disadvantage in the prior art. Nails, claws and talons are examples of keratinous growths.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]     Thus, it is an object of the present invention to alleviate and eliminate the cutting into the root or the ‚Äúquick‚Äù of a nail during a nail trimming procedure, with the ‚Äúquick‚Äù being the nerve bundle and blood supply capillaries. It is a further object of the invention to provide a nail clipping tool through the use of which it is possible to alleviate and eliminate the cutting into the root of a nail during a nail trimming procedure. It is also an object of the invention to provide a nail clipper meeting the aforesaid objects, which is ergonomical to the user. These and other objects satisfied by the present invention shall become apparent from the disclosure which follows.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0005]     The present invention provides a device useful for cutting items needing to be trimmed, including nails, claws and talons of various animal and bird species. A device according to one form of the invention comprises an upper handle means and a lower handle means, wherein the upper handle means and the lower handle means are pivotally connected to one another.

                        <p>          [0018]     In  FIG. 4  is shown a side section view of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">nail clipper  20</span>  according to an alternate form of the present invention. In this figure, are shown the respective positions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutting tang  30</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">flexible conduit  10</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lamp head  12</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">upper handle means  44</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">lower handle means  42</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">handle grips  40</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">lamp means  51</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">wire  53</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">handle grips  40</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">battery  18</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">lever tang  59</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">spring  16</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">blade means  55</span> , and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">link  57</span> . This embodiment shows how the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">upper handle means  44</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">lower handle means  42</span>  cooperatively function to cause the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">blade means  55</span>  to move laterally about the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">hole  14</span>  to shear an item to be cut which is disposed through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">hole  14</span> . By squeezing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">handle means  44</span>  and  42  together, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">lever tang  59</span>  moves the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">blade means  55</span>  across the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">cutting hole  14</span>  by virtue of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">lever tang  59</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">blade means  55</span>  se being connected to one another by means of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">link  57</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">Spring  16</span>  has a first end portion which is anchored to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">lower handle means  42</span>  and a second end portion which is in contact with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">lever tang  59</span> , so that when the handle means are released, the spring pulls back on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">lever tang  59</span>  to cause the handles to open up with respect to one another while simultaneously pulling the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">blade means  55</span>  back to its original position, and such mechanisms are generally known in the art.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]     In  FIG. 4  is also shown the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">battery  18</span>  in effective electrical contact with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">lamp me<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">ans  51</span>  via wire  53</span> , which is disposed through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">flexible conduit  10</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">wire  53</span>  may be single conductor, or multiple conductor, and in one embodiment of the invention the chassis of the device is fabricated from a metallic material such as steel which enables the chassis to function as one of the wires of contact between the battery and the lamp means, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">thus permitting wire  53</span>  to be a single conductor. There is an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem69">electrical switch means  69</span>  disposed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lamp head  12</span>  whose function is to enable the user to selectively complete and disrupt the circuit, as desired, to turn the lamp on or off; however, the switch mea<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem69">ns (either single pole or double pole)  69</span>  may be disposed anywhere on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">device  20</span> . In a preferred embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">lamp means  51</span>  is an incandescent lamp, operating at a voltage of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> about 1</span>.5 volts or less, and the most preferred battery is a AA size dry cell battery. In an alternate form of the invention, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">battery  18</span>  is a rechargeable battery selected from the group consisting of: nickel metal hydride batteries, nickel cadmium batteries, lithium batteries, and lithium ion batteries; however, any re-chargeable cell is suitable for use in the present invention.

                        <p>          [0020]      FIG. 5  shows a side cutaway view of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">nail clipper  20</span>  according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention in which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">battery means  61</span>  is a compact battery such as the type used in wrist watches and other consume devices requiring a compact source of electricity. In this embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">battery  61</span>  is disposed in the lamp head itself. Thus, it is seen that the present invention uses an electrical storage means (battery) to power the lamp means. In one preferred form of the invention, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">battery  18</span>  is affixed to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">upper handle means  44</span> . In an alternate form of the invention, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">battery  18</span>  may be affixed to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">lower handle means  42</span> . In either of these embodiments, the handle portion itself may be configured during fabrication to contain a space into which the battery may be housed. In another alternative form of the invention, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">battery  61</span>  may be of compact size and may be contained within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lamp head  12</span>  itself. In this  FIG. 5  are also shown the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">flexible conduit  10</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">upper handle means  44</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">lower h<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">andle means  42</span>  handle grips  40</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">spring  16</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">blade means  55</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">lever tang  59</span> , and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">link  57</span> , which is a tiny rod or stiff wire. In this embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">handle grips  40</span>  are shown to be contoured to match the contours of certain people&#39;s hands.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">flexible conduit means  10</span>  may be comprised of any material which is rigid enough to maintain the lamp head in any position selected by the user, so as to enable the direction of the light emitted from the lamp head to be oriented in any desired direction. However, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">flexible conduit means  10</span>  must also be flexible enough to be bent, straightened, and otherwise shaped as desired. Towards such end, the flexible conduit used by Black &amp; Decker company in the manufacture of its SNAKELIGHT‚Ñ¢ flashlight is but one example of a type of conduit means suitable for use in the present invention. Another suitable material useful as the conduit means is a plastic coated metallic tubing which is comprised of a plurality of interlocking annular elements which are reminiscent of scales. The conduit means in one form of the invention is hollow, to enable passage of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">wire  53</span>  therethrough. In other embodiments, such as where the battery means is contained within the lamp head, the flexible conduit does not necessarily need to be provided with a hollow interior space through which a wire can be housed. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">flexible conduit means  10</span>  may be as simple as comprising a hollow tube or wire. In addition, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lamp head  12</span>  may include one or more lenses useful for adjustably focusing the light beam emitted from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">lamp means  51</span> , to focus the light beam at a point at a desired distance from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lamp head  12</span> , as the use of such a lens or lenses for this purpose is known in the art, one example of which is the MAG-LILTE¬Æ flashlight available from MAG INSTRUMENT of Ontario, Calif.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]     A clipping device according to the invention may be comprised of any material, including various metals, polymers, composites, etc. and may also further include features which enable the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">blade means  55</span>  to be changed or removed from the device, as the use of removable and switchable blades are known in the art.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]     Consideration must be given to the fact that although this invention has been described and disclosed in relation to certain preferred embodiments, obvious equivalent modifications and alterations thereof will become apparent to one of ordinary skill in this art upon reading and understanding this specification and the claims appended hereto.
