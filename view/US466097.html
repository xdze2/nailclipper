                        <p>  Application filed October 31, 1891.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern.-   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, CARL H. GUESS, a citizen of the United States, residing in Buffalo, in the county of Erie and State of New York, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Corn-Extractors, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My invention consists in a new and improved device for extracting corns,and will be fully and clearlyhereinafter described and claimed, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a front elevation of the combined cutting and scraping device, showing a side elevation of the handle. Fig. 2 is a detached top view of the combined cutting and scraping device. Fig. 3 is a side elevation of the cutting and scraping device, showing also the round or convex side of the handle. Fig. 4 is a similar view of the cutting and scraping device, showing also the rough or emery face of the handle.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring to the drawings,1 represents the round or convex side of the handle. It is preferably made of wood, but may be made of any other suitable material.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> One side 2</span> of this handle is made flat and is covered with emery, pulverized quartz, or other suitable material that presents a good cutting-surface. The object of this roughened side of the han- Serial No. 410,416. (No model.)   </p>
                    
                        <p>  dle is to provide a convenient means in the same instrument for smoothing over the&#39;rough places after the corn has been extracted.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The combined cutter and scraper is formed of tempered steel in a loop shape and secured to the handle by driving the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> shank 3</span> into it, substantially as shown. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> front edge 4</span> is slightly curved, substantially as shown, and made very sharp. At the rear is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> sharppointed picker 5</span>. The edges, it will-be seen, 40 incline slightly from the bottom upward, so as not to be inclined to dig down into the foot or toe while being used. Its object is to provide the means for picking up or starting the corn, and the object of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> curved cuttingedge 4</span> is to assist in extracting the corn and trimming off the rougher portions, after which the emery-covered portion of the handle is used to smooth the portions left after taking the corn out or trimming it down.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  I claim as my invention A corn-extractor consisting of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> loop-shaped steel cutter 4</span>, having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> pointed picker 5</span> at the rear of the cutter, the whole formed in one piece and secured to a handle, substantially as described.   </p>
