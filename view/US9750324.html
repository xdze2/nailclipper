                        <p>      This application claims the priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/116,153 filed on Feb. 13, 2015, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.  </p>

                        <p>      FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates to a nail clipper having a ring member (in particular, a thumb ring) mounted to a lever member of the nail clipper, in which the ring member is configured to allow a user to insert its thumb thereto, and thus, facilitating easy and firm holding of the clipper with the thumb and other fingers of the user.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Nail clippers typically include first and second plate members that are joined together at one end, and having a pair of jaw portions at the opposite end thereof, and an operating lever coupled to the plate members for moving the jaws from an open position to a nail cutting position. The first and second plate members of such conventional nail clippers are made of polished metal materials, and usually have narrow tip portions onto which the thumb and other fingers are to be properly placed to cut finger nails or toe nails of the user. As the metallic tip portions of the plate members are often slippery, and it is burdensome and uncomfortable for the user to securely hold the nail clipper at the narrow and slippery tip portions thereof. As such, the user must operate the nail clipper with care in order not to get an accidental injury when nail cutting.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In an attempt to overcome such shortcomings or inconvenience in the conventional nail clippers, U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,960 to Tottenham proposed a nail clipper structure (see  FIG. 8 ) with a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ring members  24</span>  and  38  attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> . More specifically, in this nail clipper design, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">first ring  24</span>  is attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">operation lever  20</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">second ring  38</span>  is attached to the clipper body (i.e., the combination of  12  and  14 ) for facilitating easy grasping the nail clipper. One advantage of this nail clipper is that the use may grasp the nail clipper more securely as the thumb and another finger (generally, the index finger) are inserted into the two ring members, and thus, the nail clipper can hardly escape from the hand of the user, and reducing the risk of injury to the user. However, since this nail clipper allows only one finger (e.g., the index finger) to the bottom ring member, it is not ideal and causes inconvenience or discomfort to the user. This is at least because the pressure that is put solely on one finger (e.g., index finger) can cause discomfort on the finger. Moreover, as each of the rings is formed with one ring member, the contact areas for the fingers (namely, the contact area at the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">connection pin  16</span>  to which the rings are attached) are limited in space (see  FIG. 8 ). Thus, this nail clipper can produce excessive pressure onto the respective contacting fingers (i.e., the thumb and the index finger) that are respectively inserted to the two ring members for operation. In addition, as two fingers (i.e., the thumb and the index finger) of the user&#39;s hand are required to be inserted to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">two rings  24</span>  and  38 , the gripping posture for grasping the nail clipper is limited by this restriction, and thus, this causes inconvenience to the user.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problems or shortcomings occurring in the prior art nail clippers, and the present invention is contemplated to provide a nail clipper which is simple in design, and reliable and durable in structure, while also allowing the user to safely and comfortably operate the device. For this, the nail clipper of the present invention utilizes only one ring member, namely, a thumb ring with double ring structure, to provide secured hold of the nail clipper with the thumb inserted in the thumb ring, while allowing the clipper body to be firmly held with two or more fingers, such as the index finger, the middle finger, and others. In this manner, the nail clipper can be firmly held in more natural and comfortable way since two or more fingers are used to firmly support and grasp the bottom side of the nail clipper in cooperation with the thumb which is securely inserted to the double thumb ring attached to the operation lever. Thus, this design can provide more control in operation and comfort since multiple fingers are used for firmly grasping the clipper body member that can distribute pressure among the multiple fingers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Moreover, the thumb ring of the present invention has a double ring structure with two rings in parallel relation with each other, and with a connection plate having a predetermined width for connecting to bridge between the lower portions of the two ring members, a wider and planar contact area onto which the thumb of the user applies pressure can be provided in the connection plate. Accordingly, the nail clipper of the present invention can be used without discomfort to the user, especially elderly persons, women, and children. Furthermore, the thumb ring of the present invention is freely rotatable with respect to the lever member to which the thumb ring is attached, and thus, the nail clipper can be positioned on the user&#39;s hand and fingers in various different gripping postureâ€”see  FIGS. 7A, 7B, and 7C , for example. Thus, this provides further comfort and more control for the user&#39;s benefits.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Moreover, the operating lever unit (that is, the combination of the operation lever and the thumb ring) of the present invention is designed to have a standardized lever thickness (e.g., 1-2 mm), and the distal tip area (including the hook opening) of the lever is also sized to have standardized dimensions to enable the users to replace, without difficulty, the operation levers of their existing nail clippers with the operation lever units of the present invention. Moreover, the ring member is also designed to be easily replaced with a new one when desired, utilizing the re-attachable fasteners coupling the ring member to the lever. Thus, the users can also have a high degree of freedom in selection, in addition to the convenience and comfort in operation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      According to one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the nail clipper comprises: a clipper body formed with first and second clipper body members, said first and second clipper body members each having a matching jaw portion at a distal portion thereof for clipping operation; a lever member configured to move said match jaw portions from an opened position to a cutting position for cutting a nail inserted between said matching jaw portions; a thumb ring member rotatably mounted to a proximal end of the lever member, the thumb ring member including first and second ring members, said first and second ring members each having a generally circular, elliptical or oval ring shape with an inner opening through which a thumb of a user can be introduced for clipping operation, the first and second ring members disposed in parallel relation to each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The thumb ring member further comprises a connection plate member of a predetermined width and length, said connection plate member formed unitarily with the first and second ring members into one piece, and thereby connecting and bridging between a lower portion of the first and second ring members, the connection plate member having a planar upper surface and including a bore formed vertically through the connection plate member, and a fastener coupled to the bore of the connection plate member and allowing the thumb ring member to freely rotate relative to the lever member.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to the drawings, the nail clippers of the present invention are described herein in detail in association with exemplary or currently preferred embodiments thereof. However, the following descriptions of such embodiments are intended primarily for illustrating the principles and exemplary constructions of the nail clippers of the present invention, and the present invention is not specifically limited to these exemplary embodiments. Thus, one skilled in the art can appreciate or recognize that various modifications and substitutions can be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Throughout the disclosure, the same or similar elements and portions thereof are referred and described with the same reference characters for the simplicity and illustrative purposes.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      With reference to  FIGS. 1 and 2 , the nail clipper according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention is described herein below. As depicted in the drawings, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipper  100</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">first clipper body member  102</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">second clipper body member  104</span>  coupled together at a first end by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">pin member  106</span>  or by other known coupling elements, such as rivets, coupling screws, and the like. Each of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">body members  102</span>  and  104  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">cutting jaw  108</span>  at a second end opposing to the first end, and is configured to cut nails upon operation. These members are configured such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">cutting jaws  108</span>  are normally in a spaced apart relationship, and can be moved into a cutting position as the user operates the nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      For clipping operation, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipper  100</span>  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">operating lever  110</span>  connected to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">pin or hook member  112</span>  which extends through a set of bores formed at the second end of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">second clipper body members  102</span>  and  104 . A distal tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">operating lever  110</span>  is coupled to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">hook member  112</span>  so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  can be rotated between the operating position (shown in  FIGS. 1 and 2 ) and the retracted or storing position (shown in  FIG. 5 ). The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">hook member  112</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">hooking groove  114</span> , and a distal tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  (where a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">hook opening  116</span>  is located) is engaged to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">hooking groove  114</span> . In the operating position, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  contacts the upper surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">first body member  102</span>  to provide a leverage effect, and is capable of causing the jaw portions to move towards each other to cut or trim an object (e.g., finger nails or toe nails) inserted between the jaw portions.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipper  100</span>  further includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">ring member  120</span>  which is rotatably mounted to a proximal tip portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">operating lever  110</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">ring member  120</span>  preferably has a double ring structure composed with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">first ring  122</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem124">second ring  124</span>  disposed in parallel relation to each other, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">each ring  122</span>  and  124  having a generally circular ring shape, defining a generally circular, oval, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem125">elliptical or similarly-shaped opening  125</span>  with a dimension suitable for the thumbs of users to be introduced without having much clearance. It is noted that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">ring member  120</span>  can be provided in different ring sizes (e.g., small, medium, and large sizes) to meet the size of the thumb of the particular user.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">two rings  122</span>  and  124  are displaced to have a predetermined gap there-between, and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">connection plate  126</span>  with the same width as that of the parallel gap is unitarily connected to bridge the lower sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">two parallel rings  122</span>  and  124 . For this, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">each ring  122</span>  and  124  preferably includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem127">relatively linear region  127</span>  in addition to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem129">generally circular region  129</span> , as shown in  FIG. 3 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The upper surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">connection plate  126</span>  can provide a suitably-sized planar surface area to which a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">fastener  140</span>  of relatively wide and planar contact surface is to be coupled as shown in  FIGS. 1, 2 and 4A , in which the contact surface of the fastener is used for the thumb of the user to apply pressure toward the c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">lipper body ( 102</span>  and  104 ) for the clipping operation. Thus, the user can cut its nails comfortably owing to the wide and relatively planar contact surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">fastener  140</span> . As will be described below in detail in connection with  FIG. 4B , the head portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">fastener  140</span>  can be received in a counter bore formed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">connection plate  126</span>  to provide an enlarged contact surface on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">connection plate  126</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In order to mount the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">ring member  120</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">connection plate  126</span>  comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">bore or hole  126</span>   a  (shown in  FIG. 4A ) to which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">fastener  140</span>  passes through for coupling thereto. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">fastener  140</span>  preferably includes a m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">ale fastener member (or screw)  140</span>   a  with a planar head portion as discussed above, and a f<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">emale fastener member (or nut)  140</span>   b  configured to pass through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">bore  126</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">connection plate  126</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">corresponding bore  110</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  in order to securely fasten to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">male fastener  140</span>   a.     </p>
                    
                        <p>      According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention as shown in  FIG. 4B , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">connection plate  126</span>  is modified to include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">counter bore  126</span>   b  at an upper side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">coupling hole  126</span>   a , and the head portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">male fastener  140</span>   a  is completely inserted to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">counter bore  126</span>   b  with its upper surface flush with the upper surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">connection plate  126</span> , and thereby, provides a wider and planar contact surface for the thumb of the user to be more comfortably contacted thereto to pressurize the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  for the clipping operation. This embodiment may be more advantageous as the combination of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">connection plate  126</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">fastener  140</span>  provides a more spacious horizontal contact surface than that of the nail clipper of  FIG. 4A , thus, removing concentrated pressure in use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      According to another embodiment of the present invention as shown in  FIG. 4C , the fastener member can be in the form of a rivet (e.g., solid rivet, tubular or semi-tubular rivet, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem141">split or reusable/re-attachable rivet  141</span>  (as shown in  FIG. 4C ), and other types of rivets), or it can be other types of fasteners known in the art. In the embodiment shown, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem141">rivet  141</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem141">head portion  141</span>   a  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem141">body portion  141</span>   b , and the body portion preferably includes <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem141">two or more leg portions  141</span>   c  with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem141">splits  141</span>   d  formed between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem141">leg portions  141</span>   c . Here, the body portion is formed of elastic or spring materials, and thus, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem141">leg portions  141</span>   c  can be elastically deformed between a contracted position (enabling the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem141">rivet  141</span>  to be inserted through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">holes  126</span>   a  and  110   a  formed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">connection plate  126</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span> ), and an expanded position restoring its original shape after assembly (as shown in  FIG. 4C ). In this embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem141">head portion  141</span>   a  of the rivet is shown to be exposed outside. However, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">connection plate  126</span>  can be modified to include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">counter bore  126</span>   b  (as shown in  FIG. 4B ), and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem141">head portion  141</span>   a  can be inserted in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">counter bore  126</span>   b  to provide a wider planar contact surface.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      According to one preferred embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">connection plate  126</span>  has a length (in direction parallel to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">rings  122</span>  and  124 ) in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> range about 12</span> to 22 mm, a width in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> range about 10</span> to 18 mm, and a thickness in a range about 0.2 to 0.6 mm. In order to provide suitable support space, the proximal tip portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">operating lever  110</span>  on which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">ring member  120</span>  is attached, has a width about the same or a bit larger than the width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">ring member  120</span> , as illustrated in  FIG. 6 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126"> </p>
                    
                        <p>      Each bore  126</span>   a  and  110   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">connection plate  126</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  has a diameter the same as or a little larger than the corresponding body diameter of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">fastening members  140</span>  and  141 . As a result, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">double ring member  120</span>  is free to rotate relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">operating lever  110</span> , and thus, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">ring member  120</span>  can be positioned at any desired operation positions according to the intents of the user. The operation positions can include, without limitations thereto, a first operating position (as shown in  FIG. 1 ) with the two rings aligned in parallel relation with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span> , and thus, enabling the thumb of the user to be placed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  at right angle (as shown in  FIG. 7A ), and a second operating position (as shown in  FIG. 2 ) with the two rings aligned in perpendicular orientation with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span> , and thus, enabling the thumb of the user to be placed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  in alignment to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  (as shown in  FIG. 7B ), and a third operating position having the thumb of the user inserted through the rings while the nail clipper is held diagonally on the palm with the last three fingers on the operation lever to apply pressure (as shown in  FIG. 7C ). As illustrated, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipper  100</span>  of the present invention can be comfortably placed on the multiple fingers, including the index finger, the middle finger, and others, while the thumb is securely inserted through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">two parallel rings  122</span>  and  124 . Thus, this design can provide more control in the clipping operation and comfort since multiple fingers are used for firmly grasping the clipper body that can distribute pressure among the multiple fingers. As such, the design of the nail clipper of the present invention is more ergonomically satisfactory for the benefits of the users, such as individuals using the clippers for their own personal use, and commercial service providers (e.g., commercial nail care service provides) using the nail clippers routinely and more frequently for their services.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">ring member  120</span>  (including the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">double rings  122</span>  and  124  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">connection plate  126</span> ) can be formed of various structural materials, for example, such as metallic materials, rubber, and plastics or polymer materials. In one preferred embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">double rings  122</span> ,  124 , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">connection plate  126</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">ringer member  120</span>  are formed into one unitary piece with a mold utilizing plastic and/or rubber molding processes known in the art. In another embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">double rings  122</span> ,  124 , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem126">connection plate  126</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">ringer member  120</span>  are made of metallic materials (such as steel, aluminum, and bronze) and formed into one unitary piece utilizing conventional metal work processes including machining, metallurgy processes, and others.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        FIG. 5  illustrates the nail clipper of the present invention, with the lever and the ring member in a storing position. In the storing position, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  is turned over to overlap the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">second clipper body members  102</span>  and  104 , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">two rings  122</span>  and  124  of the double ring member are respectively positioned laterally outside of the proximal tip portion of the clipper body. This allows the nail clipper to assume a compact configuration for storage. If desired, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">two rings  122</span>  and  124  may be positioned in an alternative position (not shown), with the proximal tip portion of the clipper body inserted to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem125">openings  125</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">two rings  122</span>  and  124  formed of flexible materials such as rubber or resilient plastics.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      With reference to  FIG. 6 , it is further noted that the combination of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">lever  110</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">ring member  120</span>  (that is, an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103">operating lever unit  103</span>  as shown) can be sold or distributed independently of the nail clipper of the present invention, and people who have their own nail clippers can replace their existing lever members with the operation lever units of the present invention. For this, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103">operating lever unit  103</span>  of the present invention is designed to have a standardized lever thickness (e.g., 1-2 mm), and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">hook opening  116</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105">distal tip area  105</span>  of the lever is also sized to have standardized dimensions to enable the replacement without difficulty. Moreover, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">ring member  120</span>  is also designed to be easily replaced with a new one when desired, utilizing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">re-attachable fasteners  140</span>  and  141  ( FIGS. 4A-4C ). Thus, the users can have a high degree of freedom in selection, as well as the enhanced convenience and comfortability in use as explained above.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As described above in connection with several exemplary embodiments thereof, the present invention is contemplated to provide a nail clipper which is simple in design, and reliable and durable in structure, while also allowing the user to safely and comfortably operate the nail clipper without the fears of accidental damage to the persons receiving the nail cut services.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The above disclosed embodiments of the invention are representatives of a presently preferred form of the invention, but are intended to be illustrative rather than definitive thereof. Accordingly, those skilled in the art will appreciate or recognize that various modifications and substitutions can be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as set forth in the appended claims. </p>
