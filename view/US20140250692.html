                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> An improved apparatus for use with nails or claws comprising an adjustable pressure activated clipper, which effectively closes upon successful capture and engagement of a nail or claw due to pressure realized on the surface of the clipper&amp;#39;s articulating trigger by the nail or claw. In operation, as pressure is applied to the internal surface portion of the trigger by the user, the trigger automatically articulates and releases the refracted blade to cut the nail or claw at the desired length. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0002]    The present invention is in the technical field of clippers. More particularly, the present invention is in the technical field of clippers that are used for cutting nails or claws of animals.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    2. Description of Related Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    In order to clip the nails or claws of an animal with typical clipping instruments, a user typically holds a clipping tool in one hand and maintains control and proper positioning of the animal with the other hand. The user is then required to keep the clipper tool prepared until successful capture and engagement of the animal&#39;s nail or claw by the clipping tool. Once successful capture and engagement of the animal&#39;s nail or claw occurs, the user can then utilize the clipping tool by applying pressure on the clipper&#39;s cutting mechanism, enabling it to cut the nail or claw. In such a setting, the user may be limited as to what nails or claws may be successfully captured and engaged because of the need to retain the use of a single hand in order to maintain readiness of the clipper for successful capture, engagement and cutting of the nail or claw. In such a setting, the user may also be limited as to what consistent length the nail or claw would be cut because of a typical clipper&#39;s design, which requires that the user maintain close proximity and contact with the clipper to manipulate the cutting mechanism for successful capture and engagement of the nail or claw. The cumbersome, slow and inconsistent operation of typical clipping instruments presents a risk of substantial injury to the quick of an animal&#39;s nail or claw during the cutting process. Thus, there remains a considerable need for devices that facilitate the successful capture, engagement and consistent cutting of a nail or claw to a desired adjustable length.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0005]    The present invention is directed at a clipper for use with animal nails or claws and features a mechanical design that enables the clipper to be easily preset in a ready position through an articulating motion and rapidly utilized through a pressure motion. The clipper is designed to remain in a preset position until the receptacle makes appropriate contact with its intended target. The present invention provides a pressure activated clipper mechanism that easily and rapidly activates upon successful capture and engagement of a targeted nail or claw due to appropriate directional pressure realized on, or other contact made with the receptacle portion of the invention by a nail or claw. The present invention substantially decreases the time required and effort to successfully capture, engage and cut a nail or claw to a desired adjustable length.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    The present invention utilizes a cutting mechanism with an articulating lever that can be easily manipulated in such a way as to prepare the trigger to activate the cutting mechanism. Once the trigger is prepared, it remains ready until the invention makes appropriate contact with the intended nail or claw target so as to activate the cutting mechanism. The present invention enables this appropriate contact to be made on the inside of the receptacle portion through a pushing or hitting motion. In either form of intended contact, contact made with a nail or claw activates the invention&#39;s preset trigger, which quickly activates the cutting mechanism and easily cuts the engaged nail or claw inside the receptacle, substantially reducing the risk of injury to the quick of the animal&#39;s nail or claw. The invention also facilitates the repetitive and laborious steps required to cut all of an animal&#39;s nails or claws to a consistent length. Embodiments of the present invention include utilizing a user-adjustable positioning mechanism within the receptacle, which enables a user to easily preset a desired nail or claw cutting length. The present invention is also useful for livestock, where the unpredictable movement of livestock animals often presents substantial difficulties for engaging nails or claws into a cutting receptacle. Larger-sized embodiments of the present invention can be utilized and mounted on poles or beams, enabling vertical up-grabs, horizontal grabs, angular grabs or other positioning to secure a nail or claw.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    The mass of the unit surrounding the cutting receptacle of the invention provides stability that permits one-handed securing of the invention&#39;s receptacle to a nail or claw. In other embodiments of the invention, some or all of the individual parts that comprise the assembly may be combined, reducing the number of parts, and made of materials including but not limited to aluminum, stainless steel or combinations thereof. In other embodiments of the invention, some or all of the individual parts that comprise the assembly may be made of plastic materials to save weight or reduce cost.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    The pressure activated clipper may have a variety of configurations, shapes, or sizes depending on the size and type of a nail or claw and necessary loading requirements. For instance, a larger or longer nail or claw would use a wider or deeper receptacle to enable successful engagement. A nail or claw necessitating a higher loading level would use a larger, heavier pressure activated clipper to enable successful capture, engagement, and secure retention of the nail or claw for clipping. A thicker nail or claw would also utilize a blade capable of higher loads to enable successful and consistent results when cutting.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    The present invention introduces such refinements. In its preferred embodiments, the present invention has several aspects or facets that can be used independently, although they are preferably employed together to optimize their benefits. All of the foregoing operational principles and advantages of the present invention will be more fully appreciated upon consideration of the following detailed description, with reference to the appended drawings.  </p>

                        <p>        [0136]    The Stopper Assembly consists of a Stopper  0700  that enables the Blade Spring  0535  to be compressed and functions to hold the Blade Holder Assembly in a loaded state. A Stopper Pivot Pin  0710  that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem700">mounts Stopper  700</span>  in the Joint Stopper Holder  0560  is received by a Stopper Pivot Pin Hole  0720 . A Stopper Spring  0730  serves as a force that makes the Stopper  0700  rotate upwards and around the Stopper Pivot Pin  0710 . A Stopper Spring Screw  0740  serves as a container for the Stopper Spring  0730 . The Stopper Assembly also consists of a Stopper Stop Pin  0750  that positions the Stopper  0700  by stopping it in a precise location after its movement upwards. The Stopper Stop Pin  0750  is received by a Stopper Stop Pin Hole  0760  receptacle and fits into a Stopper Stop Pin Notch  0765 , which serves as a resting wall for the Stopper Stop Pin  0750  and provides stability for the Stopper Assembly.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        Trigger Assembly  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0137]    The Trigger Assembly consists of a Trigger Main Body  0800  that functions as a holder for the Trigger Assembly components, Trigger Sub Assembly components, and functions to both cock the clipper and initiate a cutting action by releasing the Blade Holder Assembly from its cocked position. The Trigger Main Body  0800  also contains a Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  that serves as a counter-force for the Stopper  0700  and makes releasing the Blade Holder Assembly from its cocked position effortless. The Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  is positioned in the Trigger Main Body  0800  by a Trigger Ball Bearing Pin  0820  that extends through Trigger Ball Bearing Pin Holes  0830 . A Trigger Pivot Pin  0840  that allows the Trigger Assembly to rotate and positions the Trigger Assembly in the Clipper Main Body  0050 , by being mounted in the Clipper Main Body Trigger Pivot Pin Holes  0090 , is received by Trigger Pivot Pin Holes  0850 . The Trigger Spring Hole  0860  serves as a housing for the Trigger Spring  0870  that has a Trigger Bearing Ball  0880  on each end of it. The Trigger Spring  0870  serves as force that turns and keeps the Trigger Assembly in an upright position. The Trigger Spring  0870  also provides friction and holding force for the Depth Adjustment Screw  0910 . The Trigger Main Body  0800  has Trigger Bottom Plate Screw Receptacles  0890 , which receive Trigger Bottom Plate Screws  0950 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>        Trigger Sub Assembly  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0138]    The Trigger Sub Assembly consists of a Depth Adjuster  0900  that dictates what length of the nail or the claw is allowed into the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060  and acts as a striking element for activating the Trigger Assembly. A Depth Adjustment Screw  0910  regulates the position of the Depth Adjuster  0900 . The Trigger Sub Assembly is stabilized and prevented from torsional rotation by a Depth Adjuster Spin Preventer Pin  0920  which prevents the Depth Adjuster  0900  from spinning while the Depth Adjustment Screw  0910  is being spun around it, causing the Depth Adjuster  0900  to be forced up or down based upon the spinning direction of the Depth Adjustment Screw  0910 . The Trigger Sub Assembly is anchored and secured by a Trigger Bottom Plate  0930  containing Trigger Bottom Plate Screw Holes  0940 , each of which is intended to receive a Trigger Bottom Plate Screw  0950 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>        Clipper Motion  </p>
                    
                        <p>      General Overview  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Initial Preparation of the Clipper:  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0139]    Turning the Hook  0260  to the Middle Indent  0300  permits the Handle Body  0100  to go all the way open. The Handle Return Spring  0440  serves to push the Pushing Link  0460 . The Pushing Link  0460  will then swing the handle open. During this process, the Stopper  0700  travels under the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  (See  FIG. 9 ) until it passes the Trigger Ban Bearing  0810  (See  FIG. 10 ). Now the Stopper Spring  0730  pushes the Stopper  0700  up until the Stopper Stop Pin  0750  hits the Stopper Stop Pin Notch  0765 . At the same time, the Trigger Spring  0870  swings the Trigger Assembly clockwise (See  FIG. 10 ). The front of the Trigger Assembly is now stopped against the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060  area (See  FIGS. 10 ,  11 , and  12 ), Now the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  and Stopper  0700  are facing each other (head to head). The Depth Adjuster  0900  and Trigger Main Body  0800  are designed to have an adjustable configuration that is achieved by spinning the Depth. Adjustment Screw  0910 . By spinning the Depth Adjustment Screw  0910  either clockwise or counterclockwise, the Depth Adjuster  0900  travels either up or down within the Trigger Main Body  0800 , and as a result, creates a varying amount of space between the top of the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060  and the top of the Depth Adjuster  0900 . This space dictates how much of the nail or claw can be inserted into the Cover Plate Nail Engagement Receptacle  0040  and further into the Clipper Main Body Nail Receptacle  0060 . Once the Depth Adjustment Screw  0910  is adjusted by the user to the desired position, the Depth Adjuster  0900  and Trigger Main Body  0800  function as a solid unit to cut the nail or claw to a desired length. Adjusting the depth can be done during this initial preparation process, before attempting to cut a nail or claw. This depth adjustment process can also easily be repeated before cutting each individual nail or claw if achieving different lengths of cuts is desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        Loading (Cocking) the Clipper:  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0140]    The initial geometry of the Trigger Pivot Pin  0840 , Trigger Ball Bearing Pin  0820 , and Stopper Pivot Pin  0710  is crucial to facilitate initial movement of the clipper mechanism, such that if you draw a straight line between the centers of the Trigger Pivot Pin  0840  and Stopper Pivot Pin  0710 , the center of the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  will be slightly above that line (See  FIG. 9 ). The subsequent geometry of the Trigger Pivot Pin  0840 , Trigger Ball Bearing Pin  0820 , and Stopper Pivot Pin  0710  is similarly crucial to facilitate continued movement of the clipper mechanism, such that if you draw a straight line between centers of the Trigger Pivot Pin  0840  and Stopper Pivot Pin  0710 , the center of the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  will be slightly below that line (See  FIGS. 10 ,  11 , and  12 ). This subsequent unique geometry means that if you apply pressure between the Stopper  0700  and Trigger Ball Bearing  0810 , that pressure will force the Trigger Assembly into a clockwise motion that forces the Trigger Assembly into remaining pressed against the Clipper Main Body  0050 . This same pressure also forces the Stopper  0700  to remain in an up position. By enabling the Handle Body  0100  to swing open, the Blade Holder Assembly is retracted backwards. As a result, the Blade  0600  then allows access for the nail or claw to be inserted into the Cover Plate Nail Engagement Receptacle  0040  and into the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060 . Squeezing the Handle Body  0100  causes the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  and Stopper  0700  to come into contact against each other. As a result, the Blade Holder Assembly cannot be moved forward, but the Blade Spring  0535  can be compressed by squeezing the Handle Body  0100 . Squeezing the Handle Body  0100  causes the Pushing Link  0460  to go forward while the Blade Holder Assembly remains stationary. The Pushing Rod  0510  slides inside the Pushing Link Rod Receptacle  0490 . As a result, the Blade Spring  0535  is compressed (See  FIGS. 11 and 12 ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0141]    Squeezing the Handle Body  0100  even farther causes the pressure to mount between the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  and the face of the Stopper  0700 . To maintain an inline position between the Trigger Pivot Pin  0840 , Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  and Stopper Pivot Pin  0710 , the angle of the face of the Stopper  0700  must be machined so that it is 90 degrees to a line drawn between the Trigger Pivot Pin  0840 , Trigger Ball Bearing pin  0820  and Stopper Pivot Pin  0710 . This configuration guarantees that no matter how high the pressure is between the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  and Stopper  0700 , the Trigger Assembly and the Stopper Assembly will remain in this configuration until the Handle Body  0100  is fully squeezed and the Blade Spring  0535  is compressed. However, at a 90-degrees configuration during cocking, the Trigger Assembly becomes very sensitive, so much that a mere tap against anything could torque the Trigger Assembly counter clockwise, activating it and causing the Blade Holder Assembly to shoot forward prematurely. In order to reduce the sensitivity of the Trigger Assembly and ensure that the Trigger Assembly and the Stopper  0700  remain in proper configuration when the Trigger Pivot Pin  0840 , Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  and Stopper Pivot Pin  0710  are in line while the spring is being compressed, the Stopper  0700  face angle measured from the bottom must be increased slightly. By increasing the Stopper  0700  face angle slightly as measured from the bottom, the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  is forced to migrate downwards and Stopper  0700  is forced upwards. Those forces also cause the Trigger Assembly and Stopper  0700  to rotate clockwise resulting in the Trigger Assembly being pressed against the Clipper Main Body  0050 , and the Stopper Stop Pin  0750  being pressed against the Joint Stopper Holder  0560 . The clockwise forces of the Trigger Assembly and Stopper  0700  are related to the size of the Stopper  0700  face angle. The higher the Stopper  0700  face angle, the stronger the resulting clockwise force is. A higher angle results in a larger clockwise force, making the Trigger Assembly more difficult to activate. The optimum range of Stopper  0700  face angles for proper device function is 1 to 4 degrees, past the neutral 90-degree angle. A 4-degree angle past a neutral 90-degree angle results in the highest Trigger tension with the lowest activation sensitivity, while a 1-degree angle past a neutral 90-degree angle results in the Trigger having higher sensitivity to being activated. The clipper can be configured for different animal sizes and situations by installing the Stopper  0700  with different face angles.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        Cutting Nails:  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0142]    By inserting a nail or claw into the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060 , it makes contact with the Depth Adjuster  0900 . Pressure against the Depth Adjuster  0900  causes the Trigger Assembly to rotate counter clockwise (See  FIG. 13 ). The Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  travels up until it finds itself above the Stopper  0700  (See  FIG. 14 ). Now the loaded Blade Holder Assembly shoots forward (See  FIGS. 14 and 15 ) and the nail is cut, such that the nail is contained inside the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060  between the Depth Adjuster  0900  and the Blade  0600 . Once fired, the Return Spring  0440  allows the Handle Body  0100  to retract, and the Blade Holder Assembly retracts, The cut nail or claw can be removed from the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060  through rapid inversion of the entire apparatus. The entire apparatus is then ready for another cycle. This cycle can be repeated very quickly (at<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> about 2</span> second increments if necessary).  </p>

                        <p>        [0143]    In the closed and locked position as shown in  FIG. 3  and  FIG. 4 , the Handle Body  0100  is secured to the Clipper Main Body  0050  by a Hook  0260 , visible in  FIG. 16  and  FIG. 17 , contained within the Clipper Latch Assembly that engages into and secures the Hook Receptacle  0080 , which is visible in  FIG. 1 . The Hook  0260  serves as a device that holds the handle assembly for storage and marketing appearance. The Hook  0260  also serves as a safety device, as it can only be inserted into Hook Receptacle  0080  if the Blade Holder Assembly is moved forward to the position when the Blade  0600  is covering the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060  and the Pushing Rod Assembly is in a released position, with Blade Spring  0535  in the relaxed phase. As shown in  FIG. 7  and  FIG. 8 , the Blade  0600  is in a non-retracted position, completely blocking the Cover Plate Nail Engagement Receptacle  0040  from receiving a nail or claw further into the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060 . The Sphere  0310  on the Handle Body  0100  enables a user to use a fingernail to reach the retracted Hook  0260 , as shown in  FIG. 18C  and articulate the Hook  0260  with a continuous pulling motion as depicted in  FIG. 18B , where the Hook  0260  is in the Middle Indent  0300  position, into a ready and fully extended position as depicted in  FIG. 18A . The Hook  0260  is received and secured by the Hook Receptacle  0080  when articulating the Handle Body  0100 , putting the device into a first or closed position.  </p>

                        <p>      Details of Motion  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0144]    In the open or ready position as shown in  FIG. 1 , the user has already separated the Handle Body  0100  from the Clipper Main Body  0050  by disengaging the Hook  0260  visible in  FIG. 16  and  FIG. 17 , from the Hook Receptacle  0080  in the Clipper Main Body  0050  visible in  FIG. 1 . The Sphere  0310  on the Handle Body  0100  enables a user to use a fingernail to reach the extended and secured Hook  0080  and articulate the Hook  0260  to disengage it from the Hook Receptacle  0080 . When the Hook  0260  is disengaged from the Hook Receptacle  0080 , permitting the Handle Body  0100  to articulate away from the Clipper Main Body  0050 , the device enters the Second or Ready Position as shown in  FIG. 1 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0145]    The user is able to articulate the Hook  0260  between the extended position in  FIG. 18A  with a continuous pushing motion which articulates the Hook  0260  as depicted in  FIG. 18B . The user is able to store the Hook  0260  in a retracted position as depicted in  FIG. 18C  and  FIG. 1 , wherein the Hook  0260  is completely refracted underneath the Hook Cover Plate  0280  and aligned flush so as not to extend past the vertical boundary of the Handle Body  0100 , as depicted in  FIG. 18C  and  FIG. 1 . The Hook  0260  can be manipulated from an extended position to a refracted position through the articulating motion of the Hook  0260  around the axis of the Shaft  0230 . The Indents  0300  as depicted in  FIG. 17  are small spherical indentations in the underside of the Hook  0260 , which receive a Ball Bearing  0250 . When a user articulates the Hook  0260  from an extended position to a retracted position and vice-versa, this Ball Bearing  0250  moves from one indent to the other to secure and maintain the Hook  0260  in the position desired by the user. This Hook  0260  articulation process is depicted in  FIG. 18A  (extended),  FIG. 18B  (partially-retracted) and  FIG. 18C  (fully-retracted).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0146]    As shown in  FIG. 7  and  FIG. 8 , the Blade  0600  is in a non-retracted position, completely blocking the Cover Plate Nail Engagement Receptacle  0040  from receiving a nail or claw even further into the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0147]    As shown in  FIG. 7  and  FIG. 8 , the Blade Holder  0570  is in the non-retracted position and the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  is resting upon the Stopper  0700  in the initial position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0148]    As shown in  FIG. 7  and  FIG. 8 , the upper round portion of the Depth Adjuster  0900  is in a resting position on top of the Trigger Main Body  0800 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>        3) First-Intermediate Position as the User Allows the Clipper Handle to Swing Open: Details of Motion  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0149]    The First-Intermediate Position is attained as the user enables articulation of the Handle Body  0100  around the axis of the Handle Pivot Pin  0140 . Articulation is achieved by Handle Return Spring  0440  force. As shown in  FIG. 9 , the Blade  0600  is in a partially-retracted position, partially blocking the Cover Plate Nail Engagement Receptacle  0040  from receiving a nail or claw further into the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0150]    As shown in  FIG. 9 , the Blade Holder  0570  is in a partially-retracted position and Stopper  0700  has moved under the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0151]    During this process, the Handle Return Spring  0440  is pushing the Rushing Link  0460 . The Pushing Link  0460  begins to swing the Handle Body  0100  open. During this process, the Stopper  0700  begins to travel under the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  (See  FIG. 9 ) until it will pass the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  (See  FIG. 10 ). The Stopper Spring  0730  will then be able to push the Stopper  0700  up until the Stopper Stop Pin  0750  hits the Stopper Stop Pin Notch  0765 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0152]    At the same time, the Trigger Spring  0870  begins to swing the Trigger Assembly clockwise (See  FIG. 10 ) until the front of the Trigger Assembly would stop against the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060  area (See  FIGS. 10 ,  11 , and  12 ). At that point, the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  and Stopper  0700  would be facing each other (head to head).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0153]    As shown in  FIG. 9 , the geometry of the Trigger Pivot Pin  0840 , Trigger Ball Bearing Pin  0820 , and Stopper Pivot Pin  0710  are crucial to facilitate movement of the clipper to the First-Intermediate Position, such that if a straight line was drawn between the centers of the Trigger Pivot Pin  0840  and Stopper Pivot Pin  0710 , the center of the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  would be slightly above that drawn straight line. This unique geometry means that if pressure was applied between the Stopper and Trigger Ball Bearing, that pressure would force the Trigger Assembly into a clockwise motion that forces the Trigger into remaining pressed against the Clipper Main Body  0050 . This same pressure also would force the Stopper  0700  to remain in an up position. By enabling the Handle Body  0100  to swing open, the Blade Holder Assembly is actually retracted backwards. The Blade  0600  then would allow access for the nail to be inserted through the Cover Plate Nail Engagement Receptacle  0040  and into the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0154]    With the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  and Stopper  0700  against each other, the Blade Holder Assembly cannot be moved forward, but the Blade Spring  0535  can be compressed by squeezing the Handle Body  0100 . Squeezing the Handle Body  0100  will cause the Pushing Link  0460  to go forward while the Blade Holder Assembly remains stationary. The Pushing Rod  0510  would slide inside the Pushing Link Rod Receptacle  0490 . As a result, the Blade Spring  0535  would be compressed (See  FIGS. 11 and 12 ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>        4) Second Intermediate Position:  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Details of Motion  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0155]    The Second-Intermediate Position is attained as the user pulls and applies further sufficient rotational force for additional separation and articulation of the Handle Body  0100  around the axis of the Handle Pivot Pin  0140 . As a result and as shown in  FIG. 10 , the Blade  0600  has moved to a completely retracted position, permitting the Cover Plate Nail Engagement Receptacle  0040  to receive a nail or claw completely into the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0156]    As shown in  FIG. 10 , the Blade Holder  0570  is in the completely-retracted position and the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  is off the Stopper  0700 . As a result, the Stopper is able to rotate to a first position around the axis of the Stopper Pivot Pin  0710  as shown in  FIG. 10 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0157]    As shown in  FIG. 10 , the Depth Adjuster  0900  has moved upwards to a ready position resulting in a space cavity underneath between it and the top of the Trigger Main Body  0800  within the Clipper Main Body Receptacle, permitting downward movement of the Depth Adjuster  0700 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0158]    The Handle Return Spring  0440  continues to push the Pushing Link  0460 . The Pushing Link  0460  continues to swing the handle open. During this process, the Stopper  0700  continues to travel under the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  (See  FIG. 9 ) until it passes the Trigger Bali Bearing  0810  (See  FIG. 10 ). The Stopper Spring  0730  can then push the Stopper  0700  up until the Stopper Stop Pin  0750  hits the Stopper Stop Pin Notch  0765 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0159]    At the same time, the Trigger Spring  0870  continues to swing the Trigger Assembly clockwise (See  FIG. 10 ) until the front of the Trigger Assembly would stop against the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060  area (See  FIGS. 10 ,  11 , and  12 ). At that point, the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  and Stopper  0700  would be facing each other (head to head).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0160]    As shown in  FIG. 10 , the geometry of the Trigger Pivot Pin  0840 , Trigger Ball Bearing Pin  0820 , and Stopper Pivot Pin  0710  are crucial to facilitate movement of the clipper to the Second-Intermediate Position, such that if a straight line was drawn between the centers of the Trigger Pivot Pin  0840  and Stopper Pivot Pin  0710 , the center of the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  would be slightly below that drawn straight line. This unique geometry means that if pressure was applied between the Stopper  0700  and Trigger Ball Bearing  0810 , that pressure would force the Trigger Assembly into a clockwise motion that forces the Trigger Main Body  0800  into remaining pressed against the Clipper Main Body  0050 . This same pressure also would force the Stopper  0700  to remain in an up position. By enabling the Handle Body  0100  to swing open, the Blade Holder Assembly is actually retracted backwards. The Blade  0600  then would allow access for the nail to be inserted to the Cover Plate Nail Engagement Receptacle  0040  and further into the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0161]    With the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  and Stopper  0700  against each other, the Blade Holder Assembly cannot be moved forward, but the Blade Spring  0535  can be compressed by squeezing the Handle Body  0100 . Squeezing the handle will cause the Pushing Link  0460  to go forward while the Blade Holder Assembly remains stationary. The Pushing Rod  0510  would slide inside the Pushing Link Rod Receptacle  0490 . As a result, the Blade Spring  0535  is further compressed (See  FIGS. 11 and 12 ).  </p>

                        <p>        [0162]    The Third-Intermediate Position is attained when the Handle Body  0100  is in the fully swung open position about the axis of the Handle Pivot Pin  0140 . As shown in  FIG. 11 , the Blade  0600  is in a completely retracted position, permitting the Cover Plate Nail Engagement Receptacle  0040  to receive a nail or claw completely into the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0163]    As shown in  FIG. 11 , the Blade Holder  0570  is in the completely-refracted position and the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  is off the Stopper  0700 .

At that point, the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  and Stopper  0700  would be facing each other (head to head).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0167]    As shown in  FIG. 11 , the geometry of the Trigger Pivot Pin  0840 , Trigger Ball Bearing Pin  0820 , and Stopper Pivot Pin  0710  are crucial to facilitate movement of the clipper to the Third-Intermediate Position, such that if a straight line was drawn between the centers of the Trigger Pivot Pin  0840  and Stopper Pivot Pin  0710 , the center of the Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  would be slightly below that drawn straight line.

                        <p>          [0186]    The insertion of a nail or claw into the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060 , to a sufficient depth based on the adjustable setting of the Depth Adjustment Screw  0910 , causes the nail or claw to make contact with the Depth Adjuster  0900 . Pressure against the Depth Adjuster  0900  causes the Trigger Assembly to rotate counter clockwise (See  FIG. 13 ). The Trigger Ball Bearing  0810  travels up until it finds itself above the Stopper  0700  (See  FIG. 14 ). Now, the loaded. Blade Holder Assembly shoots forward (See  FIGS. 14 and 15 ) and the Blade  0600  cuts the nail.  </p>

                        <p>          [0190]    After the loaded Blade Holder Assembly shoots forward (See  FIGS. 14 and 15 ) and the nail or claw is cut, the nail or claw is contained inside the Nail Engagement Receptacle between the Depth Adjuster  0900  and the Blade  0600 . Once fired, the Handle Return Spring  0440  allows the handle to retract, and the Blade Holder Assembly retracts. The cut nail or claw can be removed from the Clipper Main Body Nail Engagement Receptacle  0060  through inversion of the entire apparatus. The apparatus is then ready for another cycle that can be repeated very quickly (at<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> about 2</span> second increments if necessary), or the user may adjust the desired cutting length by rotating the Depth Adjustment Screw  0910  as necessary before repetition.  </p>
