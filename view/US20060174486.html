                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A nail clipper includes a pincer forming multiple opposed sections. A first opposed section includes a first jaw spaced from a second jaw of a second opposed section. The nail clipper also includes a transverse assembling pin mounted between the opposed sections of the pincer. At least one handle is provided. The at least one handle includes a short portion and a long portion. The short portion is mounted to the transverse assembling pin such that a fulcrum point of the handle on the transverse assembling pin remains at substantially a cross-sectional center of the transverse assembling pin when the at least one handle is rotated relative to the pincer. </p>

                        <p>        [0002]     1. Field of the Disclosure   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]     The present disclosure relates to nail clippers. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to nail clippers that distribute cutting force at cutting edges.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]     2. Background Information   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]     U.S. Pat. No. 6,173,497 is directed to a nail clipper which includes a central symmetrical resilient pincer member with cutting edges at an open end. The nail clipper also includes a transverse pin with hooked ends that pass through opposed and aligned bores on the jaws of the pincer member near the open end. Twin lateral handles are connected at the hooked end of the transverse pin, and remain aligned at all positions. The configuration of U.S. Pat. No. 6,173,497 allows a user to change a relative angle between the pincer member and the twin lateral handles. A cutting stroke can be performed at practically any angle between the pincer member and the lateral handles.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]     The configuration of U.S. Pat. No. 6,173,497 provides both an increased mechanical advantage and improved ergonomic characteristics for the nail clippers disclosed therein. However, according to the configuration of U.S. Pat. No. 6,173,497, when the handles are angled with respect to a pincer member, e.g., at 90 degrees, a resistance point is positioned near the lateral edge of the pincer members. As a result, an opposed pressing force is applied to the handles during the cutting stroke, and the cutting stroke is not evenly distributed.  </p>

As described and shown with respect to  FIG. 3 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">bore  11</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">transverse assembling pin  7</span>  is aligned with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">bores  16</span> ,  17  of the U-shaped short section of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">handle  13</span> . Further, although not shown in  FIG. 3 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">bore  10</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">transverse assembling pin  7</span>  is aligned with the corresponding bores of the U-shaped short section of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handle  12</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0056]      FIG. 5  also shows that a center of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">symmetrical bores  10</span> ,  111  is offset from a center of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">transverse assembling pin  7</span> . This arrangement is also shown in the top view of  FIG. 3  by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">bore  11</span> . On the other hand, a line segment that connects the center of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">protrusions  20</span> ,  21  on the U-shaped short section of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">handle  13</span>  passes through a cross-sectional center of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">transverse assembling pin  7</span> . As a result, regardless of the rotation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handles  12</span> ,  13  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">transverse assembling pin  7</span> , a central fulcrum point of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handles  12</span> ,  13  is placed at or near the center of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">assembling pin  7</span> . Accordingly, a cutting force of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">cutting edges  5</span> ,  6  is more evenly distributed along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">cutting edges  5</span> ,  6  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handles  12</span> ,  13  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">transverse assembling pin  7</span>  are rotated and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handles  12</span> ,  13  are squeezed together. This distribution of the cutting force is improved in comparison to when the fulcrum upon which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handles  12</span> ,  13  are levered is placed near the edge of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">pincer  2</span>  by rotation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handles  12</span> ,  13  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">transverse assembling pin  7</span> . Of course, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handles  12</span> ,  13  may be leveraged by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">more than two protrusions  20</span> ,  21  on each U-shaped short section of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handles  12</span> ,  13 , in which the fulcrum will depend on the relative placement of the protrusions.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0057]      FIG. 6  shows an end view of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">assembling pin  7</span>  in isolation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0058]      FIG. 7  is a view of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">small diameter steel wire or rod  19</span> , and  FIG. 8  is an end view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">small diameter steel wire or rod  19</span>  (which is the same as the corresponding small diamete<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">r steel wire or rod provided for handle  12</span> ). The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">small diameter steel wire or rod  19</span>  through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">bores  16</span> ,  11 ,  17  serves as an axle on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">which handle  13</span>  is rotatably mounted. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">corresponding small diameter steel wire  18</span>  through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">corresponding bores  14</span> ,  10 ,  15  serves as an axle on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">which handle  12</span>  is rotatably mounted.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0059]      FIG. 9  is a side elevation view of a second embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">nail clipper  22</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">central pincer member  23</span>  composed of two substantially equal and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">opposed jaw members  24</span> ,  25 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">jaw members  24</span> ,  25  are rigidly connected at a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">closed end  26</span> . The connection of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">jaw members  24</span> ,  25  may be accomplished in any suitable manner, e.g., by welding or rivets. As shown, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">central pincer member  23</span>  is generally formed in a V-shape, with an open end of the “V” partially closed by the opposed sections of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">sharp cutting edges  5</span> ,  6 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">sharp cutting edges  5</span> ,  6  may have any suitable shape to perform a cutting function.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0060]      FIGS. 10A and 10B  are a front elevation view and a top elevation view of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">nail clipper  22</span>  according to the second embodiment. As shown, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">nail clipper  22</span>  includes <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handles  12</span> ,  13  deployed at a 90 degree angle with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">jaws pincer  2</span> ,  23 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">Small protrusions  20</span> ,  21  make contact with the lateral jaws along the prolongation line of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">pin  7</span> . As shown in the top elevation view of  FIG. 10B , the fulcrum along the line segment between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">small protrusions  20</span> ,  21  is consistently centered at or near the cross sectional center of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">transverse assembling pin  7</span>  even when the handles and the transverse assembling pin are rotated by 90 degrees. This allows a more even distribution of the squeezing force of the jaws, which in turn permits a more even distribution of the cutting force along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">cutting edges  5</span> ,  6 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0061]      FIGS. 11-14  show a third embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail clipper  1</span>  is similar to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail clipper  1</span>  in the first embodiment. However, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail clipper  1</span>  in  FIGS. 11-14  is not provided with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">the cam-like semi-spherical protrusions  20</span> ,  21  of the first embodiment. Rather, in the third embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">fulcrum point  28</span> ,  29  is determined by the bending angles of the short and long portions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handles  12</span> ,  13 . As shown, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">fulcrum point  28</span> ,  29  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail clipper  1</span>  of the third embodiment is placed and maintained at or near the center of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">transverse assembling pin  7</span> . This arrangement permits a substantially even distribution of the cutting force at the cutting edges even when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handles  12</span> ,  13  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">transverse assembling pin  7</span>  are rotated.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0062]     As described above, a nail clipper as disclosed herein includes a handle that is mounted to a transverse assembling pin such that a fulcrum point of the handle on the transverse assembling pin remains at or near (substantially at) a cross-sectional center of the transverse assembling pin when the handle is rotated relative to a pincer of the nail clipper. This permits an even application of a cutting force compared to when a fulcrum point of the handle on the transverse assembling pin is positioned near the edge of a pincer member, such as when the handles and a transverse assembling pin are rotated relative to the pincer member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0063]     The illustrations of the embodiments described herein are intended to provide a general understanding of the structure of the various embodiments.
