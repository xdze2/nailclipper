                        <p>    BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The present invention relates generally to personal care products, and more specifically to illuminated implements for use by a caregiver when providing personal care to its charge.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Personal care products and tools have evolved and been developed for attending to personal hygiene of a human body. The evolution and development of these products and tools has largely been to enhance products for use by an individual in performance of their own personal care. When only a single person is involved, and that person controls the timing, urgency, and manner of performance of the product or tool, different parameters of the product or tool are optimized, created, emphasized and/or implemented.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    However, when providing personal care for another person, particularly to a very young child or senior adult, the caregiver does not always control the timing, urgency, and manner of performance. Specifically, the caregiver may desire to provide various personal care procedures at times or locations that are not otherwise optimal. One common environmental factor that may not be able to be optimized in such situations is a level of ambient light in the vicinity of the procedure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Besides these concerns, when providing personal care for another person, particularly to a very young child or senior adult, many caregivers prefer to enhance the level of care provided, including greater attention to safety procedures and use of safer tools. This is true even in situations where the caregiver may control some of the timing, urgency, and manner of performance, such as to increase a general level of ambient light. For this example, the caregiver may desire to precisely increase a level of illumination for use of personal care tool when a very young child or senior adult is involved.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Beyond these concerns, factors for acceptability and adoption of personal care procedures include ease of use, convenience, efficiency, and effectiveness. Portable illumination components (e.g., flashlights) have existed separate and distinct from tools so conventional systems either require coordination of the light source and a tool, or various forms of integration have been developed to mate a light to a tool. Some of the integration are simple physical connections that keep the tool and the light source together while others actually try to achieve a more synergistic combination. Maintaining ease of use, convenience, efficiency, and effectiveness becomes more challenging as multiple diverse functions are merged together. In the example of personal care applied to a young child or senior adult, enabling single-handed use and operation while providing the multiple diverse functions becomes increasingly difficult yet even more challenging. A caregiver often must use one hand for the tool and the other to interact with the young child or senior adult.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    It should not be missed that improvements to procedures and tools that aid a care giver when attending to young children and senior adults may in many cases also assist in self-administration and self-care. Thus, it is a consideration that improvements to procedures and tools for administration to others not degrade or adversely affect self-administration.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    One consequence of these factors is that some personal care products and tools are sometimes equipped with lights. Such conventional personal care products and tools have ON-OFF switches to control the light source independent from operation. The light for these devices is thus not always active and useful when the user operates the device. In some cases, operation of the device is delayed or interrupted while the light is manually illuminated. In other cases, the light is left on beyond the time of use because the switch was not manually returned to the off position, decreasing the longtime usefulness of the product or tool. Caregivers would prefer to have a product or tool that does not delay or interrupt their use, and one that does not have a premature end to its anticipated usefulness.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Today&#39;s consumer is inundated with offers to sell many different products and services, some of which may actually be of interest to the potential consumer. In some instances, interactive packaging (also sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúTry Me‚Äù packaging) may enhance an appeal of a product. For such products, it is advantageous to provide appropriate ‚ÄúTry Me‚Äù packaging. However, the state of the art does not permit a priori knowledge as to which products would be benefited from being packaged in an interactive format. Developing a superior product does not always equate with increased sales, at least until the market knows and understands the new product. There are many consumer products that incorporate microprocessors and microcontrollers that may include ‚ÄúTry Me‚Äù routines or programs that effectively address some of the concerns of ‚ÄúTry Me‚Äù packaging. However, for articles of manufacture that do not include electronic controllers, designing a product and its packaging to implement ‚ÄúTry Me‚Äù retailing is more challenging. Some conventional products have developed use of momentary switches or special multi-function switches so that a ‚Äúcontinuous on‚Äù mode of the switch may be disabled by the packaging while providing access to an ‚ÄúOn while pressed‚Äù mode of the switch.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    What is needed are personal care products, tools, and procedures that address and overcome the deficiencies of the current products and tools; specifically what is needed are products, tools, and procedures for simply and efficiently increasing a level of illumination at the operational point of personal care products, tools, and procedures. Additionally, designing such products, tools, and procedures so that they include features or functions that may be emphasized in suitable interactive packaging is also beneficial.  </p>

This implement, as shown, is configured for human fingernails but as well-known, other configurations for the plates, shaft, and lever may be adapted to cut other nails, for example toenails and nails of non-humans. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> </p>
                    
                        <p>    Clipper  100</span>  includes, in addition to the components of the nail-cutting implement, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem125">molded thumb pad  125</span>  and an illumination subsystem that includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">housing  150</span> , and an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">illumination boom  155</span>  moveably coupled (e.g., rotationally) to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">housing  150</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">Housing  150</span>  contains a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem160">battery  160</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem165">switch  165</span>  for controlling an illumination source (such as a white LED shown in  FIG. 3 ) and encloses a back end of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105">plate  105</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">plate  110</span> . In the closed configuration shown in  FIG. 1 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">clipper  100</span>  has <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">illumination boom  155</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">lev<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">er  120</span>  folded against housing  150</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIG. 2  is the lateral view of the illuminated clipper of  FIG. 1  in an open mode with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">lever  120</span>  lifted and rotated into an operational position. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">preferred embodiment shown for clipper  100</span>  permits operation without activating the illumination subsystem and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">deploying illumination boom  155</span>  when illumination is not necessary or desired. In the open mode, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">clipper  100</span>  operates in conventional fashion in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">which lever  120</span>  cooperates with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">shaft  115</span>  to springingly engage and disengage cooperating cutting edges disposed on ends of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105">plate  105</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">plate  110</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem125">Thumb pad  125</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">housing<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">  150</span> /boom  155</span>  provide for grips so that the cutting edges are easily manipulated by squeezing and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">relaxing lever  120</span>  relative to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">housing  150</span> . In the preferred embodiments, the grips are adapted to enhance the clipping experience, which may include widening, lengthening, conforming, and other modifications to the grip dimensions, as well as material selection (e.g., cushioning) to enhance operation of the clipping subsystem.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIG. 3  is the lateral view of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">illuminated clipper  100</span>  of  FIG. 2  in the open mode with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">illumination boom  155</span>  in an operational mode. Engaging an operational mode of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">illumination boom  155</span>  exposes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">illumination source  300</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">positions source  300</span>  at a position between a user and the cutting edges to illuminate a field-of-view that includes the cutting edges and some appropriate distance in front. In the preferred embodiment, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">source  300</span>  is powered by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem160">battery  160</span>  and an ON/OFF status of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">source  300</span>  is controlled by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem165">switch  165</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem165">Switch  165</span>  is coupled to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">illumination boom  155</span>  so movement of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">boom  155</span>  between the operational mode and the stowed mode controls switch operation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    As shown in this preferred embodiment, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">boom  155</span>  rotates greater than one hundred eighty degrees relative to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">housing  150</span>  when moving between the stowed and the operation modes and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem165">switch  165</span>  is coupled to a pivot point so the rotation controls operation of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem165">switch  165</span> . In the most preferred embodiment, as explained below, the configuration of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem165">switch  165</span>  in relation to ON/OFF switching responsive to rotation is established so that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">source  300</span>  is off except for the last few degrees (e.g., about five degrees) of a range of rotation, though implementations and embodiments may vary.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    A threshold for determining the ON/OFF responsiveness of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem165">switch  165</span>  varies in different embodiments and implementations, however the preferred embodiment more easily permits use of a package-enhancing features during marketing, such as a ‚ÄúTry Me‚Äù package. Thus the features of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem165">incorpor<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">ating switch  165</span>  into clippers  100</span>  in a manner that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">source  300</span>  is responsive to operational deployment and establishing thresholds for ON/OFF responsiveness so that a desired feature (in this case illumination) is enabled during a small end-portion of boom-deploying rotation, combines to produce in this imp<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">lementation characteristics for clipper  100</span>  that enable consumer-level retail ‚ÄúTry Me‚Äù packaging. (Such as, for example, providing packaging that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">lightly biases illumination boom  155</span>  into a rotational position close to the threshold, but with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">source  300</span>  inactive.) The packaging, in permitting a prospective customer to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">move boom  155</span>  past the threshold to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">activate source  300</span>  interactively presents the illumination feature, but <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">returns source  300</span>  to the inactive status when the prospective customer is done interacting with the packaging. Providing the boom close to the threshold, near the extreme end of range of movement, and using a lever arm, permits the biasing mechanism in the packaging to be implemented efficiently and inexpensively. For example, foam may be adhered to appropriate portions of a package in contact with the actuating handle. Other biasing systems, e.g., metal springs and the like, may also be used. This configuration permits light force, short distance biasing systems to be used that are often quite simple, effective, virtually error-free, and inexpensive.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIG. 4  is a top view of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">illuminated clipper  100</span>  shown in  FIG. 3 . As shown, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">clipper  100</span>  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">aperture  400</span>  in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">boom  155</span>  that permits the ends of the plates to pass through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">boom  155</span>  as it is moved to the operational mode from the stowed mode and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">permits lever  120</span>  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">control cutting action while boom  155</span>  is located generally between a user and the cooperating cutting edges. Additionally,  FIG. 4  illustrates an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem405">electrically conductive path  405</span>  that forms an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem160">electrical circuit for battery  160</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem165">switch  165</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">source  300</span> . Current in this electrical circuit is controlled by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem165">switch  165</span> , and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem165">switch  165</span>  is controlled in turn by a positional rotation of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">illumination boom  155</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    In operation, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">user opens clipper  100</span>  by lifting and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">rotating lever  120</span>  to permit clipping operations. In the event that the user desires or requires illumination of a clipping zone that includes the cutting edges and some appropriate distance in front of the cutting edges determined by the application, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">user rotates boom  155</span>  from the stowed position to the operational position. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem165">Switch  165</span> , sometime during this rotation of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">boom  155</span>  as determined by design considerations specific to an embodiment and implementation, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem405">closes conductive path  405</span>  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem160">cause battery  160</span>  to produce an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">electrical potential across source  300</span>  so that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">source  300</span>  illuminates the clipping zone. When clipping is complete, or illumination is no longer needed or desired in the clipping zone, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">user rotates boom  155</span>  from the operational mode to the stowed mode, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem405">opening path  405</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">extinguishing source  300</span> . When <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">boom  155</span>  is in the stowed mode, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">boom  155</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">housing<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">  150</span>  protect source  300</span>  and help to keep it clean.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Other variations and modifications are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, some of these variations and modifications are described above, Other variations and modifications include changes to battery location and a location/operation of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">boom  155</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">Boom  155</span>  variations may include differences in stowage/operational locations (e.g., illuminating from a location near a rear of the housing and the like), as well as a manner of transitioning between these modes besides or in addition to rotating (e.g., sliding, shifting, expanding, traversing, and the like). Further, in the preferred embodiment, a synergistic combination of the illumination boom and the housing is achieved by providing for the stowage mode to be ‚Äúbeneath‚Äù the housing. The synergy is that this configuration permits the light source and ‚Äúunderside‚Äù of the illumination boom to be protected by the housing when illumination is not desired. Thus to position the light source for such a boom into a desired location of shining ‚Äúdown‚Äù on the cutting edges, the illumination boom rotates greater than one hundred eighty degrees relative to the housing when swinging out from under the housing. However, in other configurations, implementations, and embodiments, such as when boom is stowed on top of the housing, the boom rotates between about ninety and about one hundred degrees relative to the housing. In such a case, a different protection mechanism is necessary. This is relative movement as a user may alternatively hold the boom stationary and move the housing, or some combination of movement of both components.  </p>
