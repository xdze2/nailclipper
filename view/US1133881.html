                        <p>   MM/humus To all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, EDWARD K. OSTNESS, a citizen of the United States, residing at Beloit, in the county of Rock and State of Wisconsin, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Corn-Extractors, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My invention is directed to improvements in corn treating instruments, and its primary object is the provision of an instrument of this kind by the use of which the whole or a portion of the corn may be taken away without removing the surrounding callous flesh so as to utilize such flesh as a protector for the part treated.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A further object of the invention is the provision of a corn treating instrument wherein the scraping blade is so housed as to protect it from germs, dust and other foreign matter.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A still further object of the invention is the provision of a corn treating instrument with means adapted tocenter the scraping blade over the corn and to prevent the blade from acting upon the surrounding callous flesh.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   With the above and other objects in view, the invention consists in the construction, combination and arrangement of parts hereinafter fully described and claimed and illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 1 is a view in side elevation on an enlarged scale of a corn treating instrument constructed in accordance with my inven tion, and Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken on a plane extending vertically and centrally through the instrument.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring to the drawing by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> reference numerals 1</span> designates the body of my improved corn treating instrument. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> body 1</span> is of hollow cylindrical formation, is fully open at its ends, and is constructed of metal or any other material suitable for the purpose. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> guide 2</span> is secured within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> body 1</span> at a point near the lower end thereof, and it is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> cylindrical passage 3</span> which tapers outwardly at its lower end, as at 4. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> guide 2</span> is secured in position by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> screws 5</span>. The upper end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> body 1</span> is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> cap 6</span> having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> central opening 7</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> upper wall 8</span> thereof, and the lower end of the body is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> removable closure 9</span>, the cap and closure haging screwthreaded engagement with the b0 y.   </p>

                        <p>   Application filed Ma a, 1914. Serial No. 837,321.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> rod 10</span>, which has its lower end flattened to provide a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> blade 11</span>, and is provided at its upper end with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> knurled operating head 12</span>, is slidably and rotatably mounted within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> body 1</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> rod 10</span> works in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> passage 3</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> guide 2</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> blade 11</span> is provided with two u<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">pwardly inclined diverging scraping edges 13</span>, and it is adapted to be held normally retracted within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> body 1</span> by means of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem141"> coiled expansion spring 141</span>, which surrounds the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> rod 10</span> and which is located between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> guide 2</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> pin 15</span> fastened to the rod. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> flared portion 4</span>: of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> passage 3</span>, which is adapted to be engaged by the inclined side walls of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> blade 11</span>, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> upper wall 8</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> cap 6</span> which is adapted to be engaged by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> pin 15</span>, form stops adapted to limit the upward movement of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> rod 10</span> under the influence of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> spring 14</span>:. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> rod 10</span> projects through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> opening 7</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> cap 6</span> positioning its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> operating head 12</span> exteriorly of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> body 1</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> blade 11</span> is preferably of thin flat formation having upwardly and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> inwardly inclined side edges 16</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> divergent scraping edges 13</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   When it is desired to use the instrument, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> closure 9</span> is first removed, after which the lower end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> body 1</span> is positioned to inclose the corn. Pressure is then applied to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> head 12</span> to bring the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> point 17</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> blade 11</span> in contact with the center of the corn, after which a rotary movement is imparted to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> blade 11</span> to cause the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> edges 13</span> to scrape away the corn. The upper end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> body 1</span> centers the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> blade 11</span> and prevents it from removing any part of the callous flesh surrounding the corn. By removing the corn in this manner there is left a protector formed by callous flesh surrounding the corn. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> point 17</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> blade 11</span> is in axial alinement with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> rod 10</span>, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> scraping edges 13</span> extend upwardly and outwardly from the point. The lower end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> tube 1</span> also provides means by which the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> point 17</span> may be placed in the center of the corn and held in such position during the rotation of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> blade 11</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   From the foregoing description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawing, it should be apparent that I provide a corn treating instrument which is simple, durable and eflicient and which may be manufactured and sold at a comparatively low cost. It should also be apparent that the instrument involves a construction which will prevent the scraping edges of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> blade 11</span> from becoming damaged and which will prevent the accumulation of germs, dust&#39;and&#39; other foreign matter on the blade. As the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> spring 14</span> supports the cutting edges of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> .lade 11</span> above the lower end of the body ;1, the blade may be brought into contact with the corn with just sufiicient pressure to enable the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> scraping edges 13</span> to cut away the corn. 7   </p>
                    
                        <p>   WVhile in the foregoing there has been shown and described the preferred embodiment of this invention it is to be understood that such changes in the combination and arrangement of parts as may fall within the scope of the claims may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having thus described the invention what is claimed as new, is:   </p>
