                        <p>        [0002]    Technical Field  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    This invention relates generally to a combination tool and system, and to methods of use thereof and, more particularly, to a combination nail care or pedicure tool having a foldable housing.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    State of the Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    A manicure is a treatment to improve the appearance and health of the hands and fingernails. The treatment can include cutting, shaping, and often painting of the nails, removal of the cuticles, and massage of the hand or softening of the skin. Other nail treatments may include the application of artificial nail gels, tips, or acrylics, some of which are referred to as French manicures. Some manicures can also include the painting of pictures or designs on the nails or applying small decals or imitation jewels. When applied to the toenails and feet, this treatment is referred to as a pedicure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    A variety of tools are required to cut, shape, paint or otherwise care for or repair finger and toe nails including without limitation finger or toe nail nippers/scissors, cuticle nippers/scissors, nail clippers, tweezers, nail files, cuticle pushers, cuticle knives, nail cleaner, and hoof sticks. As a result, a manicure or pedicure set typically includes multiple tools, each of which can perform one or two of the functions necessary to perform a manicure or pedicure. Transporting or storing multiple tools for manicures and pedicures, such as when traveling, can therefore be awkward and cumbersome because of the plurality of tools required as well as the fact that they are typically elongated or very sharp tools that must be safely and carefully stored when not in use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    Combination, multi-function tools and tool kits are well known. In typical multi-function tools, a plurality of tools such as pliers, screwdrivers, knife blades, files, scissors and the like are provided in a single tool or unit The tools typically fold over and are received in channel-shaped handles or other types of housings in such tools. However, each of these technologies suffers from one or more of the following disadvantages:  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    1. the handle or other storage arrangement is usually not capable of containing or safely storing more than one or two tools or types of tools at a time;  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    2. the handle or handles are awkward to use or difficult to grip when a tool is in use;  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    3. the method of use can be somewhat slow or cumbersome in that, in order to deploy an individual tool, a series of steps is usually required (such as, for example, multi-function tool handle must first be opened, then an individual tool selected and opened, and the multi-function tool handles closed before the selected tool can be used); and  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    4. the size, arrangement or number of tools included in the combination tool or tool kit can make it difficult or impossible to use a particular tool.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    These and other disadvantages in the currently available combination tool technologies can be particularly problematic with respect to fabricating a combination manicure or pedicure tool because of, for example, the size, dimensions, number, and sharpness of the tools required.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]    Thus there is a need in the hand and foot care industry for a combination manicure or pedicure set/kit having a sufficient number of tools that can be easily and quickly deployed for use, as well as means to safely store or transport the tools when they are not in use.  </p>

                        <p>          [0029]    As used herein, the term “tool” is intended to mean a handheld device or system that aids in accomplishing a task.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0030]    The invention disclosed herein includes without limitation combination multifunctional apparatuses and system as well as methods of use for same and, in particular, combination apparatuses, methods and systems for manicures and pedicures.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0031]    One aspect of the invention is a multi-function nail care tool that includes at least two hand tools suitable for nail care, including without limitation tools for cutting, shaping or painting nails. The tools can be housed in a retractable or folding housing or case that can substantially or completely cover the tools when the tools are not in use, such as when they need to be transported or stored. In one embodiment, the housing can be a flat oval shape on the bottom with a flat oval piece on the top that fits into the oval shaped bottom section, including without limitation as a click in device. In this embodiment, either the top or bottom side of the case could be opened to provide access to one or more tools. In another embodiment, an oval shaped case may be used where each oval shaped side of the case can be split into two halves, such one half of both sides of the cover open to provide access. In yet another embodiment, the housing can have a square box or other shape on the top for the click in device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0032]    In another aspect, the housing may contain one or more internal compartments that may accommodate one or more tools that can be accessed by opening the housing. In one embodiment, the housing can include a first compartment for a tool that is integrated into the pivot mechanism used to open the housing. In another embodiment, the housing can include a second internal compartment for housing one or more tools including without limitation a cuticle pusher, a cuticle nipper and a nail file. In a further embodiment, the housing may include both such compartments. In yet another embodiment, one or more of the tools can be substantially or completely covered by the housing when not in use. In another embodiment, the housing may include one or more storage compartments on the outside of the housing.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0033]    In another aspect, the housing may contain one or more storage compartments that are external or which can provide external access to additional tools even when the housing is closed. In one embodiment, an external storage compartment can be integrated into the housing such that the compartment spans both sides of the housing, is shaped to accommodate a particular tool including without limitation a nail clipper, and can include an open, external portion or port providing ready access to the compartment whether the housing is open or closed. In another embodiment, the size, shape, or dimensions of the tool, storage compartment, housing or combination thereof can be modified in order to secure/anchor the tool to the housing when not in use. In yet another embodiment, the handle of the tool can be modified such that the tool can lock in place when stored.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0034]    In one non-limiting example of an external storage compartment, a tool and a portion of the housing or compartment therein can be fabricated such that, when the tool is placed in the housing or compartment, a tongue-in-groove member on the tool can connect with/engage a complementary tongue-in-groove member in the storage compartment or on the housing, such that the position of the tool in the housing or compartment can be temporarily secured. In one embodiment, a first surface on a handle on a tool and a second surface on a compartment in or on the housing can each be provided with complementary U-shaped grooves which, when the tool is seated in the compartment, are opposite each other, and also respective tongues immovably seated in or near the grooves in the first and second surfaces respectively, and projecting above the same so as to be capable of entering and of occupying the other groove in the opposite surface when the two surfaces are juxtaposed. Any suitable process of engagement can be employed to achieve this type of connection/engagement, including without limitation downward pressure on, sliding or extension of the tool. Any suitable mechanism or structure can be used to achieve the connection, including without limitation a pin-and-groove or tongue-and-groove mechanism or mechanism or structure. In a further embodiment, placement of a tool in the compartment, or removing it from the compartment, can be guided by a mechanism in the housing or compartment, including without limitation a pin and slide mechanism.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0035]    In another embodiment, the handle of the clippers may include one or more inverse ridge structures which can improve the grip of a user, including without limitation a human hand or mechanical gripping device or system. A ribbed or other type of raised surface on at least one portion of the top of the nail clipper handle can therefore be used to facilitate removal of the nail clipper tool as well as to enhance a user&#39;s grip when using the nail clippers as a stand-alone tool. That same surface, either alone or in combination with the housing, can also be used to improve the grip of a user when one of the other tools is in use or otherwise exposed, including without limitation cuticle nippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0036]    In one embodiment, the tool can be a nail clipper which can be released from an external storage compartment by performing one or more of the following actions. First pushing down on the handle of the clipper to disengage the connection between the tongue-in-groove member in the handle of the clipper and the complementary-shaped tongue-in-groove member in the housing/storage compartment that it locks into. One can then use a guide pin in the nail clipper to guide the clipper along a slide in the compartment until the pin meets a latch, notch or other suitable type of stop at the end of the slide, at which point one can optionally push down on the handle of the clipper a second time to fully release it from the housing. Pressure can be applied for this purpose using any suitable means, including without limitation one or more fingers or suitable mechanical means.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0037]    The nail clipper can later be replaced (put back into the combination tool) by reversing that process and thereby pushing the clipper far enough into the compartment to secure it such as, for example, by re-engaging the tongue-in-groove member on the tool with the complementary shaped tongue-in-groove member in the storage compartment located in the housing or, optionally, elsewhere in or on the housing.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0038]    In another embodiment, a port in the housing providing external access for an internal storage compartment can be covered. The storage compartment can be positioned within the housing and accessed via a tab or button at one end of the compartment, for example, a tab or button that can be accessible from the exterior surface of the housing, and which can effectively seal the compartment off from the exterior of the housing. Any suitable mechanism can be used to provide access to this type of compartment, including without limitation a spring-loaded push button mechanism. The surface of the external cover or button can be fabricated in any suitable shape or dimensions, including without limitation a cover or button that is flat or shaped to accommodate the human finger or hand, so as to be easily depressed or pushed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0039]    There are several ways the combination tool can be used depending upon which instrument or hand tool contained in the housing is chosen and how that tool is accessed or used; several non-limiting examples of use and of apparatuses and systems according to the invention are included herein as Examples.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">  </p>

                        <p>          [0043]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">tweezers  2</span>  in this embodiment are located in another <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">storage compartment  16</span>  accessible from the outside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">housing  7</span>  via a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cap or cover  20</span>  as illustrated in  FIG. 3 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">tweezers  2</span>  in that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">storage compartment  16</span>  can be manually removed from or placed into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">compartment  16</span>  when the housing is either open or closed; removal can be facilitated by using a suitable mechanism, including without limitation a spring-loaded, push-push mechanism. The tweezers can therefore have a pop in and pop out (push-push) device in them to secure the tweezers from falling out. Push it once for example, and it pops out, then push it a second time to click back into the hard shell/cover (housing) of the embodiment.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0044]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">nail file  6</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cuticle pusher  4</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cuticle scissors  4</span>  are all located in another compartment and connected at a single pivot point in this embodiment; these tools can thus flip out and lock into place when they are horizontal for easy use and any suitable locking mechanism can be used for this purpose, including without limitation locking mechanisms on or in the housing. The size, dimensions and shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">housing  7</span>  can be chosen to fit the natural contours of a gripping member, including without limitation a human hand, such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">housing  7</span>  can be used to enhance the grip of a subject when using these tools; and that grip, as well as the ability to manipulate the tool, can be further enhanced by the presence of suitably textured surfaces on the housing such as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">inverse ribbing  17</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">nail clippers  3</span>  illustrated in  FIG. 1B  and  FIG. 2 .  </p>

                        <p>        [0055]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">nail clipper  3</span>  illustrated in  FIGS. 1B-2  can slide in and out of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">housing  7</span>  along a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">slide member  21</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">storage compartment  11</span>  and, after sliding into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">storage compartment  11</span> , can lock into place using a curved, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">U-shaped groove  13</span>  at the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handle  12</span> . The sliding motion can be facilitated by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">pin  14</span>  on the nail clipper and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">slide  21</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">storage compartment  11</span> . The curved U-shaped groove in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">tongue-in-groove member  13</span>  at the back end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">nail clipper handle  12</span> , where one&#39;s fingers usually go when the tool is in use, can interact with a complementary U-shaped groove in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">tongue-in-groove member  15</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">storage compartment  11</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">housing  7</span>  such that the tool can be locked into place by pushing down on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">nail clipper  3</span> , positioning the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">tongue-in-groove member  13</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">nail clipper  3</span>  underneath the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">tongue-in-groove member  15</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">housing  7</span> , and then releasing the pressure on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">clipper  3</span> , thereby allowing the compl<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">imentary shaped tongue-in-groove member  13</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">clipper  3</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">the complementary tong-in-groove member  15</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">storage compartment  11</span>  to juxtapose or otherwise come into contact and engage. The inherently springy nature of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">nail clipper  3</span>  that facilitates this process arises when two or more metal parts are stamped together during fabrication of the tool.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0056]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">nail clipper  3</span>  in this embodiment can be released from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">storage compartment  11</span>  by pushing down on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handle  12</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">clipper  3</span>  to disengage the connection between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">tongue-in-groove member  13</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handle  12</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">clipper  3</span>  and the compl<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">ementary-shaped tongue-in-groove member  15</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">storage compartment  11</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">housing  7</span>  that it locks into. One can then use the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">pin  14</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">nail clipper  3</span>  to guide the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">clipper  3</span>  along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">slide  21</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">storage compartment  11</span>  until the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">pin  14</span>  meets a latch, notch or other suitable type of stop at the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">slide  21</span> , at which point one can push down on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">handle  12</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">clipper  3</span>  a second time to fully release it from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">storage compartment  11</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">housing  7</span> .<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">  </p>

                        <p>        [0057]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">housing  7</span>  illustrated in  FIG. 1  can be opened by taking the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">two oval housing pieces  7</span>   a  and  7   b  and unfolding them to expose the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">cuticle nippers  1</span>  inside. Placing ones hands on both sides of the oval shaped members in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">housing  7</span>   a  and  7   b,  one can then, with one hand, bring the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">two housing pieces  7</span>   a  and  7   b  close together in order to connect them and thereby form a configuration like a pair of scissors, as illustrated in  FIG. 5 . Using this method, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">cuticle nippers  1</span>  can fold at two pivot points and lock into place when they are facing out, such that one is better able to use them. The shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">housing  7</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">spring  22</span>  inside the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">cuticle nippers  1</span> , when configured correctly, can further enhance the strength or durability of the locked tool. The circular ends of the cuticle nippers having the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">pivot points  8</span>   a  and  8   b,  for example, can be fanned out to prevent the two sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">housing  7</span>   a  and  7   b  from pressing into each other. The shape of one or both of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">half ovals  7</span>   a  and  7   b  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">housing  7</span>  behind the cuticle nippers can, when configured correctly, also stop the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">cuticle nippers  1</span>  from extending too far, which can further enhance the strength and durability of the tool.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">  </p>

                        <p>        [0058]    To use the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">tweezers  2</span> , one can use a push-push mechanism to remove them from their <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">compartment  16</span>  and then secure them in place again when done using the same mechanism. In this embodiment, a push-push mechanism can be included in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">housing  7</span>  as illustrated in  FIG. 3 . In one embodiment, a push-push mechanism can include an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">angled rod  18</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">spring  19</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">button  20</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">rod  18</span>  can be spring-loaded or otherwise coupled to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">spring  19</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">button  20</span>  in order to facilitate injection and ejection of the tool. The push-push mechanism illustrated in  FIG. 3  uses a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">diagonal rod  18</span>  in order to be able to fit into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">tweezers compartment  16</span>  such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">tweezers  2</span>  do not slip; this type of rod configuration can also help lock the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">spring  19</span>  because the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">rod  18</span>  is in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">side compartment  16</span>  holding the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">tweezers  2</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">spring  19</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">rod  18</span>  are preferably small enough to fit into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">compartment  16</span>  on one side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">tweezers  2</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">spring  19</span>  can have a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">pin  23</span>  connected to it such that, when pressure is applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">diagonal rod  18</span> , the spring can push the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">pin  23</span>  down, thereby locking the tweezers into place. To use the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">tweezers  2</span> , one can click on a button, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">box or other equivalent component  20</span>  on top of the housing and it can pop out ready for use. Alternatively, a more typical spring-loaded mechanism can be used. In one embodiment, the angle of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90"> rod can range from 90</span> to 180 degrees. In another embodiment, the angle of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90"> rod can range from 90</span> to 120 degrees. In yet another embodiment, the angle of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110"> rod can range from 110</span> to 150 degrees.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">  </p>

                        <p>        [0059]    For the other tools contained in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">housing  7</span> , including without limitation the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cuticle scissors  4</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">nail file  5</span> , and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">cuticle pusher  6</span>  illustrated in  FIG. 1B  and  FIG. 4 , one can open the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">housing  7</span> , locate the tool one wants to use and then rotate it about the pivot connecting the tool to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">housing  7</span>  in order to provide an optimal position for use. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">housing  7</span>  can then be closed before use in order to enhance a subject&#39;s/user&#39;s grip when the tool is being used. These tools can thus flip out and lock into place when they are horizontal for easy use; any suitable locking mechanism can be used for this purpose, including without limitation locking mechanisms on or in the housing or the tool. Any suitable gripping device can be used for this purpose, including without limitation a hand or mechanical gripping device.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">  </p>

                        <p>        [0060]    In one embodiment, an apparatus according to the invention can be fabricated by drilling holes in the bottom and top of at least one tool, including without limitation hand tools such as <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">cuticle nippers  1</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">tweezers  2</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">nail clippers  3</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cuticle scissors  4</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">cuticle pusher  5</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">nail file  6</span> . One c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">an also take two molded housing members  7</span>   a  and  7   b,  each of which can form a half oval shape, and drill holes in the bottom and top of each member at or near a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">pivot point  9</span> . A hole in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">first housing member  7</span>   a  can then be aligned with a hole in a first tool includ<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">ing without limitation cuticle scissors  4</span>  and adding tools sequentially in the desired order, including without limitation, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">cuticle pusher  5</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">nail file  6</span> . The tools can thereby be placed where one wants or needs them, or as dictated by the size, shape or dimensions of the tool or tools desired, by aligning the holes in the first housing member with the hole in the bottom of each tool as it is added as illustrated in  FIG. 1C . After the last tool is added, one can align a hole in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">second housing member  7</span>   b  with a hole in the last tool added, thereby forming a housing which can substantially envelope or otherwise cover the tools. One can also place a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">small rod  9</span>  in the holes connecting the two half oval housing members to those tools and to each other, thereby securing the position of the stacked tools at a single pivot point, with respect to each other and to the housing. In some embodiments, there can be one or more additional single or multi-tool compartments with ports on the exterior of the housing, including without limitation compartments for tweezers or nail clippers.  </p>
