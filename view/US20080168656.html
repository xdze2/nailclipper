                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A double ended clipper, comprising a double clipper body having two opposite cutting members with a pair of cutting blades, in a planar or a stacked position. The cutting members can have clip covers covering both lateral sides of the cutting members with the clip cover leaving the cutting blades exposed. The double ended clipper is operated by a lever arm attached to the clip cover or by a handle attached to the cutting members in a similar manner as the conventional nail cutters. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> [0001]    This invention relates to a device having two cutting members in a planar or stacked arrangement.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    The double ended clipper will be applied here for beauty implements, for example, nail and cuticle cutters which would require different types of blades. In current practice, one carries or uses multiple nail cutters also known as nail clippers, one for cutting the toe nails and one for cutting the finger nails. Toe nails are the nails of the foot and finger nails are the nails of the hand. The nail cutter for the toe nails, herein referred to as toe nail cutter, usually have bigger blades than the nail cutter for the fingers, herein referred to as finger nail cutter. Also, the toe nails are usually thicker than the finger nails, necessitating two types of nail cutters. Further, nail cutters can have two kinds of blades, a straight shaped blade and a curved shaped blade. The straight shaped blades are usually placed on the toe nail cutters because the toe nails have a tendency to penetrate into the skin if cut with a curved blade which can result into an inflammation. Straight shaped blade for finger nails are usually used when the person prefers the finger nails to have a straight tip. It is also hygienic to separate the cutting members. For example, the toes are more likely to harbor microorganisms because the feet are most of the time enclosed inside a shoe for long period of hours in contrast with the finger nails which are exposed to the atmosphere most of the time. Further, using toe nail cutters to cut the finger nails does not allow one to easily and properly cut the finger nails to the desired shape and at times have caused accidental clipping of the skin around the finger nails because of the size and/or shape of the blade compared to that of the finger nails. For the reasons stated above, one usually have or carries at least two nail cutters, one for the toe nails and one for the finger nails. Carrying two nail cutters is not only bulkier but also inconvenient. A cuticle trimmer, like the other cutters, requires a different pair of cutting blades. This is usually carried as a separate device. The same can be said for the other types of cutting members having different types of blades other than the ones used here as example.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a double ended clipper or cutter having two cutting members with different types of blades of varying sizes and shapes.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    It is also an object of this invention to provide a multiple cutting device in a single portable piece.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    It is also a further object of this invention to provide a two in one type of cutting device that is easier to manufacture and at a cost lower than manufacturing separate cutting devices.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    It is also still a further object of the invention to manufacture multiple cutting members with less amount of raw materials thereby conserving on the usage of these materials.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0007]    This invention is directed to a double ended clipper, comprising a double clipper body having two opposite cutting members on each end, each with a pair of cutting blades, in a planar position; a clip cover on each cutting member covering both lateral sides of the cutting members, the clip cover leaving the cutting blades exposed; a lever arm attached to each clip cover for operating the cutting members; means for attaching the lever arm to the clip cover; and, means for attaching the double clipper body to the clip cover. The cutting members have different types of cutting blades. One design has the cutting members fused together at a mid location while another design attaches two separate cutters together at a mid section of the double ended clipper. One means for attaching the double clipper body to the clip cover of the cutting members is a tubular rivet introduced through aligned openings of the clip covers and a central opening aligned with the aligned openings of the clip covers on the double clipper body. The lever arm has a first end and a second end, the first end having a prong on each side inserting into a pair of matching openings on the clip cover and a clipper pressing end section opposite a raised platform, the raised platform located at the second end of the lever arm. Examples of matching openings are circular or a slit with a circular end. The double ended clipper can have a raised plate at an inside surface of the double clipper body. The raised plate provides a resting platform for the prongs of the lever arm when the clipper pressing end section press on the double clipper body of the double ended clipper. The lever arm swings from a keeping position to a working position as the prongs pivot around the matching openings on the clip cover. The lever arm in the working position has a raised platform higher than a raised platform of the lever arm in the keeping position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    Another design is to stack the cutting members on top of each other. This double ended clipper, comprises an assembled clipper body having two cutting members, a top cutting member stacked on top of a bottom cutting member, each cutting member opposite each other having a pair of cutting blades; a first handle for the top cutting member and a second handle for the bottom cutting member; means for assembling the clipper body; and, means for connecting the first handle to the top cutting member and the second handle to the bottom cutting member. The cutting members can have different types of cutting blades. The assembled clipper body has a first clipper plate, a common clipper plate, and a second clipper plate. The first and second clipper plates have one of the pair of cutting blades on one end and a non-bladed end opposite the cutting blade. The cutting blade of the first clipper plate is at a position opposite the cutting blade of the second clipper plate. The common clipper plate has a cutting blade at both ends of the plate, with one cutting blade pairing with the cutting blade on the first clipper plate and the other cutting blade pairing with the cutting blade of the second clipper plate. One way for assembling the clipper body is a first rivet having one end inserted into an opening at a non-bladed end of the first clipper plate and the other end inserted into an opening on one end of the common clipper plate at the same side of the opening at the non-bladed end of the first clipper plate and a second rivet having one end inserted into an opening at the common clipper plate and the other end inserted on an opening at a non-bladed end of the second clipper plate at the same side of the opening at the common clipper plate, the first and second rivets press punched to form a lip around the rim of the openings thereby connecting the first and second clipper plates with the common clipper plate. The connection between the first and second clipper plates with the common clipper plate can be reinforced by angular flanges engaging with angular notches. One way of connecting the handles to the top and bottom cutting members are by lever pins. The stacked double ended clipper can also have a clip cover for each cutting member. One example are side bars extending upwards from both lateral sides of the common clipper plate for the top cutting member and side bars extending downwards from both lateral sides of the common clipper plate for the bottom cutting member. Like the double ended clipper in a planar position, the stacked double ended clipper can also use a lever arm attached to the clip cover to operate the double ended clipper instead of the handles. The method of attaching the lever arm to the clip cover has been amply described for the planar double ended clipper and will not be reiterated for the stacked double ended clipper.  </p>

                        <p>          [0027]      FIG. 1  is a perspective view of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">double ended clipper  100</span>  in a planar orientation, hereinafter planar double ended clipper, having one type of clipper, usually a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">finger nail cutter  1</span>  shown better in  FIG. 2 , on one end and another type of clipper, usually a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">toe nail cutter  2</span> , on the other end. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">cuticle trimmer  3</span>  instead of a nail cutter can be combined with the other nail cutter in either a planar or stacked position as shown in  FIG. 1B . The above cutters will be used as examples to describe the design and construction of the double ended clipper but it should be understood that other cutters can also be constructed similarly.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]    Since there are a few types of clippers, there are also several cutting members that can be used depending upon the desired application, for example, shown here are cutting members having a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">cutting blades  11</span>  for the finger nail cutter,  12  for the toe nail cutter and  13  for the cuticle trimmer. Other cutting members not shown here may also be constructed in the planar or stacked position. The planar double ended clipper may be constructed from two clippers or cutting members fused together at a mid location or it may be assembled from two separate pieces of clippers attached together at a mid section.  FIG. 2  shows the components of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">planar double ended clipper  100</span>  with two cutting members fused together as a single piece or body at a mid location, also referred to herein as planar double clipper body. The components of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">double ended clipper  100</span>  shown in  FIG. 2  comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">first clip cover  14</span>  for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">cutting member  11</span>  of a first nail cutter and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">second clip cover  15</span>  for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">cutting member  12</span>  of a second nail cutter. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">clip cover  14</span>  is placed on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">one end  16</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">planar double clipper body  17</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lateral sides  18</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">clip cover  14</span>  covering the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">lateral sides  19</span>  on one end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">double clipper body  17</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">second clip cover  15</span>  is placed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">other end  20</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">planar double clipper body  17</span>  in the same manner as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">clip cover  14</span> , with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lateral sides  21</span>  of the second clip cover covering the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lateral sides  22</span>  on the other end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">double clipper body  17</span> . The clip cover leaves the top side of the cutting member it covers exposed, consequently, the pair of cutting blades. Each clip cover has an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">opening  23</span>  on one end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">clip cover base  24</span> . These openings on the respective clip covers are aligned with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">central opening  25</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">planar double clipper body  17</span> . After aligning the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">openings  23</span>  and  25 , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">tubular rivet  26</span>  is introduced into these openings to hold the clip covers and the double clipper body together. Other fastening means are known in the art. The cutting members at opposite ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">double ended body  17</span>  as shown in  FIG. 2  are normally open at an angle to allow the nails to be cut to go through. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">lever arm  27</span>  is attached to each clip covers,  14  and  15  for the operation of the cutting members and consequently, the cutters, as shown in  FIGS. 1 ,  3  and  4 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">lever arms  27</span>  as shown are usually in opposite orientation and spatial location to keep them from interfering with each other and to keep the length of the device as short as possible. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">Each lever arm  27</span>  has two ends, a first end and a second end. The lever arms are identical to each other. The first end of the lever arm has two prongs or a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">protrusions  28</span> , hereinafter also referred to simply as prongs, for insertion into a matching pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">openings  29</span>  on the lateral side of the clip cover. Instead of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">circular opening  29</span>   a  as shown here, this may be a pair of slits cutting into the front edge of the lateral sides of the clip covers with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">circular end  29</span>   b  through which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">two prongs  28</span>  inserts into.  FIG. 4A  shows a circular opening while  FIG. 2A  shows the slit with a circular end. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">Openings  29</span>   a  and  29   b  are hereinafter collectively referred to simply as <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">openings  29</span> . These openings are recommended to be circular at the area where the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">prongs  28</span>  pivot around when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">lever arm  27</span>  swings from a keeping position as shown in  FIGS. 1 and 3  to a working position as shown in  FIG. 4  by one of the lever arms.  FIG. 5  shows a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">lever arm  27</span>  at an intermediate swinging position prior to positioning into the working position shown in  FIG. 4 . Each lever arm has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">clipper pressing end section  30</span>  opposite a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">raised platform  31</span>  located at the second end of the lever arm. When the lever arm is in the working position, the front tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">pressing end section  30</span>  abuts on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">top surface  32</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">the exposed planar double clipper body  17</span>  with the raised platform of the lever arm in the working position higher than the raised platform of the lever arm in the keeping position as shown in  FIGS. 2A and 4A . To cut the nails or trim a cuticle, the fingers except the thumb are positioned at the bottom surface of the double ended clipper with the thumb positioned on top of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">raised platform  31</span> . The thumb presses on the raised platform which consequently translates this motion to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">pressing end section  30</span> . The pressing end section then presses on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">exposed surface  32</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">clipper body  17</span>  to cause the cutting member or pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">cutting blades  11</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">or  12<<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">/span>  or  13</span>  to come together and consequently cut any object in between the pair of cutting blades. Note that the top surface of the raised platform at the keeping position becomes the bottom surface after swinging the lever arm to the working position. Note also as shown in  FIGS. 4 and 4A  that the raised platform of the lever arm at the working position, hereinafter the working lever arm, is way on top of the other raised platform of the lever arm at the keeping position, hereinafter the keeping lever arm, thereby allowing the raised platform of the working lever arm to move up or down during the cutting operation without obstruction from the raised platform of the keeping lever arm. In using the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">double ended clipper  100</span> , one of the lever arms is usually at the working position while the other lever arm is at the keeping position, although it is also possible to operate the device with both lever arms in the working position. As shown, the raised platform can also have a curve outer surface to accommodate and allow the thumb to comfortably press on the said surface. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">raised plate  33</span>  can be placed at an inside surface of the double clipper body where the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">prongs  28</span>  can rest on when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">pressing end section  30</span>  presses on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">double clipper body  17</span>  as shown in  FIG. 6 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0029]    The planar double ended clipper has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">double ended clipper body  17</span>  that does not have the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">usual pin  34</span>  situated between the top and bottom blades of the cutting members as shown in  FIG. 7 . Consequently, it is easy for the loose cut nails or cuticles to exit the clipper and temporarily lodge inside the clip cover before being discarded after the cutting operation. The absence of the pin also makes the construction and operation of the clipper simpler.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0030]    Instead of the double ended clipper in a planar position, the cutting members can also be stacked on top of each other as shown in  FIG. 1A . As in the planar double ended clipper, the cutting members can have a variety of cutting blades of different shapes to suit a particular usage or the kind of object to be cut.  FIG. 8  shows the components of an example of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">stacked double ended clipper  100</span> . There are <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">two identical handles  35</span> , one for the bottom,  35   a,  and one for the top,  35   b,  of the stacked cutting members, herein also referred to as the assembled clipper body of the stacked double ended clipper. The assembled clipper body is made up of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">first clipper plate  36</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">common clipper plate  37</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">second clipper plate  38</span> . The first and second clipper plates have one of the pair of cutting blades on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">one edge or end  39</span>  with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">non-bladed end  40</span>  opposite the cutting blade. The cutting blade on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">first clipper plate  36</span>  is at a position opposite the cutting blade on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">second clipper plate  38</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">common clipper plate  37</span>  has a cutting blade on both ends or edges of the plate, one pairing with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">cutting blade  41</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">first clipper plate  36</span>  and the other pairing with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">cutting blade  42</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">second clipper plate  38</span> .  FIG. 9  shows how the two clippers or cutting members are assembled. One end of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">first tubular rivet  43</span>  is inserted into an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">opening  44</span>  on the non-bladed end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">first clipper plate  36</span>  and the other end is inserted into an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">opening  45</span>  on one end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">common clipper plate  37</span>  at the same side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">opening  44</span> . After insertion, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">rivet  43</span>  is press punched to form a lip as shown in  FIG. 10  around the rim of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">opening  44</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">opening  45</span> , thereby connecting the first clipper plate with the common clipper plate. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">second tubular rivet  46</span>  is used to connect the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">common clipper plate  37</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">second clipper plate  38</span> . As with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">first rivet  43</span> , one end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">second rivet  46</span>  is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">inserted into opening  47</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">common clipper plate  37</span>  and the other end is inserted on an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">opening  48</span>  at the non-bladed end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">second clipper plate  38</span>  at the same side of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">opening  47</span> . This <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">rivet  46</span>  is also press punched to connect the common clipper plate with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">second clipper plate  38</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0031]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">inter-connected plate  52</span>  is shown at the right of the arrow of  FIG. 9 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem49">Angular flanges  49</span>  engaging with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">angular notches  50</span>  on both sides of the plates reinforces the connections of the common clipper plate with the first and second clipper plates. This <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">assembled clipper body  52</span>  of the stacked double ended clipper is connected to the top and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">bottom handles  35</span>   a  and  35   b  by inserting a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">lever pin  53</span>  on one end through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">openings  54</span> ,  55 , and  56 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">lever pin  53</span>  connects the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">assembled clipper body  52</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">bottom handle  35</span>   a  while the another <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">lever pin  57</span>  connects the assembled clipper body to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">top handle  35</span>   b.  To keep the connections with the handles permanent, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">pin key  58</span>  is inserted into a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">pin hole  59</span>  of one handle, through a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">bored-through pin key hole  60</span>  at a location near one end of a lever pin and then through another <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">pin hole  61</span>  of the same handle opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">pin hole  59</span> . Further, the lever pin has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">head  62</span>  opposite the end having the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">pin key hole  60</span>  to reinforce the connection. As shown in  FIGS. 8 and 11 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">head  62</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">each lever pin  53</span>  and  57  situates on the surface of the first and second clipper plates while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem65">opposite end  65</span>  having the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">pin key hole  60</span>  situates in an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem63">etched out section  63</span>  at a front end of the handles. This connection is the same for both top and bottom handle. This connection allows the respective handles to switch from a keeping position as shown in  FIGS. 1A ,  1 B, and  11  to a working position by turning the handles around the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">lever p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180">in  57</span>  approximately  180</span>  degrees and flipping the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">handles  35</span>  over to a working position as shown in  FIG. 7  in the same way as the handle of a conventional nail cutter is positioned to a working position. For differentiation, the stacked double ended clipper identifies the lever arm for operating the cutting members as <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">handles  35</span>  while the planar double ended clipper identifies this as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">lever arm  27</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0032]    It is recommended for the stacked double ended clipper to have a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">clip cover  64</span>  on each cutting member. Examples of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">clip covers  64</span>  shown in  FIG. 11  are side bars extending upwards from the sides of the common clipper plate for the top cutting member while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">other clip cover  64</span>   a  are side bars extending downwards from the other side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">common clipper plate  37</span>  for the bottom cutting member. These <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">clip covers  64</span>  and  64   a,  like the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">clip covers  14</span>  and  15  on the planar double ended clipper, temporarily catches loose cut nails or cuticles as they are cut before being discarded after the cutting operation. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">lever arm  27</span>  as described in the planar double ended clipper can also be adopted to operate the stacked double ended clipper by attaching to the clip cover and doing away with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">handles  35</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">lever pins  57</span> . The description and the manner of switching the lever arm from the keeping position to the working position is similar and will not be reiterated here.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0033]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">handles  35</span>  are recommended to be made of a plastic material, preferably those that are non-rigid, to provide a softer touch to the fingers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0034]    The use of the term “connect”, “attach”, “assemble”, “mount”, “install” include direct or indirect connections with or without intervening or intermediary devices or other means that can couple or attach or fix the parts together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0035]    While the embodiments of the present invention have been described, it should be understood that various changes, adaptations, and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the claims. </p>
