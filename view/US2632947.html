                        <p>   A pa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">ir of cu</span>tting jaws 28 made of spring steel, or the l<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">ike, and having </span>cutting edges 34 for trimming toenails or fing<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">ernails, are prov</span>ided which are adapted to be swivelly mounted on the pin 22. The cutting jaws 28 have apertures 32 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">and 34 </span>there<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">in as can best b</span>e see<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">n in Fi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">gs. 3 and 4. </span></span>As there shown, these apertures are circular in shape so that the jaws can move axially as well as rotatably on the pin 22.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The upper jaw of the cutting jaws <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">28 has </span>a depressed portion 36 int<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">o which the enla</span>rged h<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">ead 24 of the pin 22 </span>is received and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> the lower jaw me</span>mber ha<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">s a rai</span>sed portion 38 for receiving the lug 40 on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">the support bracke</span>t IS. The lug 40 h<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">as a se</span>rrate surface so as to friction<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">ally re</span>sist rotation of the cutting jaws 28. The pin 22 is retained in pla<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">ce on the suppor</span>t bra<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">cket i8</span> by the lever arm 42 which has a rectangular aperture <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">44 at its one</span> end. The en<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">d portion 46 of the leve</span>r arm 42 is placed i<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">n the slot 26 w</span>hich ex<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">tends transve</span>rsely in the pin <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">22, and </span>when it is desired to actuate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">jaws 28</span>, the lever arm 42 is pivoted about an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">axis co-</span>exten<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">sive with sai</span>d slot &#39;26 to the position shown in solid lines in Fig. 2. The cutting jaws 28 are closed when the lever arm&<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">#39;42 and the c</span>asing II! are moved together by a pinching action. As is believed understood, the lever arm 42 will then pivot about the fulcrum<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> point IBA on</span> the bracket i8. This causes the pin 22 to be partially lowered through the ape<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">rture 2</span>0 in the support bracket 18 resultin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">g in the enl</span>arged h<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">ead 24 of the pin 2</span>2 forcing the upp<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">er jaw of the cut</span>ting ja<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">ws 28 d</span>ownwardly into engagement wit<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">h the lower jaw.</span> When pressure on the lever arm 42 is released, the jaws will return<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> to their nor</span>mally open position by virtue of the resilient properties of the spring steel of which they are made.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   vAs is believed readily understood from the above description, the cutting jaws 28 can be turned in any desired p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">osition with res</span>pect to the support bracket 18 by virtue of the swivel mou<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">nting provided. The</span> lever arm 42 and the casing I will always reta<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">in their rela</span>tive position with respect to one another by virtue of the mounting construction of the pin 22 and the lever arm 42, since neither the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> pin 22</span> or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">lever arm 42 </span>can be rotated abou<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">t the a</span>xis of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">the pin 22.  </span> </p>
                    
                        <p>   The lever arm 42 functions not onl<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">y to ac</span>tuate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> cutting jaws</span> 28, but also can be used as a nai<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">l file. The conc</span>ave surface of the lever arm 4-2 is cut in the conventional manner to provide a file 42A, and when the lever arm 42 is pivoted to the position shown <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">in phantom in</span> Fig. 2, it can be used for this purpose. The lever arm 42 is suitably curved at 48 to provi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">de the desire</span>d curvature for providing the optimum results in filing the nails. g   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The position ofthe lever arm 42 shown in phantom i<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">n Fig 2 is the normal positi</span>on of the latter when housed within the casing 10, and it is also the normal position <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">when being</span> used to file or clean the nails. The outer tip of the lever arm 42 is pointed in the conventional ma<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">nner to provi</span>de for cleaning fingernails and the like. In order to provide a relatively sturdy nail file for these latter purposes, a wedging device is provided so that the lever arm 42 will be held rather rigidly when <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">in the positi</span>on shown in phantom in Fig. 2. This wedging action results when the end portion 46 of the lever arm 42 is pivoted <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">into the angula</span>r slot <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">provided in t</span>he support bracket at 52, Fig. 3. As is believed readily understood, when the lever arm 42 is pivoted to the position shown <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">in phantom in</span> Fig. 2, the outer end portion 46 will be wedged into the a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">ngular slot 52 to pro</span>vide a rigid extension o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">f support bracke</span>t l8.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A modified form of the invention is shown in Figs. 5 and 6. This modification of the invention is substantially the same as that shown in Figs. 1-4 with the exception of the cutting jaws 54 which are pivotally connected <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">as at 5B, and th</span>e coil spring 53 which serves to bias the cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">g jaws 54 apart</span>. In all other respects, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">this nail clippe</span>r is the same as that shown in Figs. 14.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   From the above description, it is believed to be readily clear that the present invention provides a nail clipper which has no sharp edges or snags when it is carried in the closed position shown in Fig. 1. Further, it has swivelly mounted cutting jaws so that the user thereof can turn the jaws to the position which enables him to trim the fingernails or toenails with the greatest ease and facility. Also a rather simple mechanism has been provided for actuating the jaws so that a firm and positive grip can always be had when actuating said jaws, and further, this actuating mechanism can be enclosed within the casing of the nail clipper merely by being pivoted to a position forming an extension of the supporting structure. In addition, this nail clipper can be constructed from relatively few and simple parts permitting production thereof at low cost and it can be made with a majority of the elements being made of plastics or the like.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having thus described our invention, we claim: I i. In a nail clipper, a support bracket, a pin mounted against rotation on said bracket, cutting jaws mounted on said pin for swivel movement above said bracket, a lever arm pivotally connected to the lower end of said pin and in engageemnt with a fulcrum point on the lower side of said bracket, said pin extending through the bracket and each of said jaws and having anenlarged head above the upper jaw whereby when said lever arm is pivoted about said fulcrum point the pin will be axially moved with respect to said bracket to open or close said jaws.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2. In a nail clipper as claimed in claim 1, wherein said cutting jaws comprise a U-shaped spring steel member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   3. In a nai1 clipper as claimed in claim 1, wherein said cuttingjaws comprise a pair of oppositely disposed jaws pivotally connected together and a compression spring is positioned therebetween for biasing said cutting jaws apart.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   4. In a nail clipper, the combination of a support bracket having a substantially rectangular aperture therein and a fulcrum point on its lower side, a pin extending upwardly through said aperture and axially sl&#39;idable therein, said piii being substantially rectangular in cross section to prevent rotation in saidaperture, a pair of cutting jaws positioned on the upper side of saidbracket and having round holes therein through which said pin extends whereby the jaws may be swiveled on said bracket, the upper end of said pin having an enlarged head, the lower end of said pin having a transverse slot therein, and a lever arm having its one end extending into said transverse slot and another portion in engagement with said fulcrum point for moving said pin axially on pivotal movement of the lever arm about the fulcrum point so that said jaws will be closed on lowering of said said pin with respect to said support bracket.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   5. In a nail clipper, the combination as claimed in claim 4 wherein said cutting jaws comprise a U-shaped spring steel member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   6. In a nail clipper, the combination as claimed in claim 4 wherein said cutting jaws comprise a pair of opposite disposed jaws pivotally connected together, and a compression spring is positioned therebetween for biasing said cutting jaws apart.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   7. In a manicuring device, the combination of a support bracket having an aperture therein, a pin extending upwardly through said aperture and axially slidable therein, a pair of cutting jaws positioned on the upper side of said bracket and having apertures therein through which said pin extends, the upper end of said pin having an enlarged head, the lower end of said pin having a transverse slot in one side thereof, a fulcrum point on the lower side of said bracket and on the opposite side of said pin from its slot, a lever arm having a transverse pivot member at its one end in pivotal position in said slot for actuating said jaws when said arm is pivoted on the fulcrum and for forming an extension of said bracket when said arm is pivoted to another position, and an angular slot formed in said bracket for receiving a portion of said transverse pivot member in wedging relation when said arm is pivoted to the other position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   8. A nail clipper comprising a tubular memher, a reversible closure member on one end of the tubular member carrying a support bracket, a pin extending through said support bracket, cutting jaws mounted on said pin, a lever arm pivotally connected to one end of said pin and in engagement with a fulcrum point on said bracket, said pin extending through said jaws and having an enlarged portion at its other end so that when said lever arm is pivoted in one direction about said fulcrum point the pin will be moved to open or close said jaws and when the lever is pivoted in an opposite direction to a position forming an extension of the bracket the cutting jaws, lever arm and pin can be housed within the tubular member.   </p>
