Jurena, 5430 W. Forest Home Ave., Milwaukee, Wis. 53220 Filed June 10, 1968, Ser. No. 735,830 Int. Cl.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> A45d 29</span>/02 US. CI. 3028 7 &#34;Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Fingernail and toenail clippers are conventionally made in a variety of sizes with an opening between the cutting edges of the clipper to accommodate nails of various thicknesses and shapes. In particular, it is desirable to have a clipper for every application which has an opening between the cutting edges just a tiny fraction of an inch more than the nail to be cut, regardless of the thickness or shape of the nail. In this manner the nail is cut more efiiciently, and skin next to the nail is readily excluded from the opening or space between the blades or cutting edges.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention disclosed herein provides a conventional clipper which is arranged to be adjusted by the user to accommodate fingernails or toenails, whereby a single clipper can be used to fulfill all clipping needs. More particularly, the clipper includes a pair of spring leaves joined at one end and having curved sharpened complementary edges at the other end with an adjustable actuating assembly connected to compress the spring leaves and to adjust the distance between the sharpened edges. The distance between the cutting edges on the leaf springs is adjustable to receive fingernails or toenails of various configurations, whether or not they are smooth, and regardless of their thickness. The spring leaves are constructed heavily enough to be capable of clipping either fingernails or toenails. Although only two embodiments of the invention are shown and described, other embodiments are present without departing from the scope of my invention, which is defined by the claims.   </p>

                        <p>  DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Although the disclosure hereof is detailed and exact to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, the physical embodiments herein disclosed merely exemplify the invention which may be embodied in other specific structure. The scope of the invention is defined in the claims appended hereto.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   3,555,675. Patented Jan. 19, 1971 As shown in the drawing the clipper of my invention comprises a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> heavy <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">spring leaves 10 and 12</span></span> joined at one end by means of an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> eyelet 14</span> to form a normally open tongs. The free end of each spring leaf is bent toward the other spring leaf to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> form flanges 14</span> which are curved to conform to the shape of the edge of a fingernail or toenail. :Each of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> flanges 14</span> terminates in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> beveled cutting edge 16</span> which is so sharpened that when the leaves are compressed to bring the cutting edges together the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> sharpened edges 16</span> meet along their entire length.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> leaves<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> 10 and 12</span></span> are moved into cuttingengagement to cut a fingernail or toenail by means of an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> adjustable actuating assembly 15</span> which includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lever 18</span> pivotally connected to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> spring<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> leaves 10 and 12</span></span> by means of an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> adjustable cylindrical stud 20</span>. More specifically, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> spring<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> leaves 10 and 12</span></span> are provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> aligned holes 22</span> centered laterally of the leaves and located just behind the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> curved flanges 14</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> cylindrical stud 20</span> extends through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> holes 22</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> spring<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> leaves 10 and 12</span></span> with one end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> stud 20</span> connected to one of the spring leaves. In a conventional clipper this would be accomplished by putting a head on the other end of the cylindrical stud. This connection is modified in accordance with my invention to provide a stud having a variable height so that the distance between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cutting edges 16</span> may be adjusted. As shown in FIG. 3 the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> stud 20</span> consists of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> lower portion or member 28</span> having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> tapped bore 29</span> to receive a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> threaded shank 30</span> provided on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> upper portion or member 32</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> lower member 28</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> conventional head 34</span> to apply reaction force to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> lower spring leaf 12</span> when the clipper is to be closed. Because of the threaded connection between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> upper member 32</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> lower member 28</span> of the stud, the len th of the stud may be changed simply by rotating the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> upper member 32</span> of the stud relative to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> lower member 28</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> actuating lever 18</span> is provided with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> opening 36</span> to receive the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> upper member 32</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> stud 20</span> with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> bar 26</span> across the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> opening 36</span> to engage a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> slot 24</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> upper member 32</span>. An<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> upset portion 38</span> is provided immediately adjacent the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> opening 36</span> to engage the surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> spring leaf 10</span> adjacent to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> hole 22</span>. The remaining portion or free end of the actuating lever is adapted to be pressed by the user to cause the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> upset portion 38</span> to bear on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> spring leaf 10</span> and compress the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> spring<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> leaves 10 and 12</span></span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Adjustment of the distance between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cutting edges 16</span> is accomplished by rotating the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> actuating lever 18</span> about the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> stud 20</span> to turn the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> upper member 32</span> relative to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> lower member 28</span>. Depending on the direction of rotation of the actuating lever, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> upper member 32</span> will be screwed into or out of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> lower member 28</span>. Although the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> lower member 28</span> of the stud is shown round, it can be made in a shape other than round, i.e., square, with a correspondingly shaped hole to hold the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> lower member 28</span> fixed when the upper member is rotated. This adjustment of the length of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> stud 20</span> makes it possible to vary the distance between the cutting edges to correctly fit thin, thick or irregular shaped toenails or fingernails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In FIG. 4 a modified stud is shown in which the lower member is in the form of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> boss 50</span> welded to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> spring leaf 12</span> in alignment with the location of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> hole 22</span> in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> spring leaf 10</span>.
