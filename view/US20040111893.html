                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A nail clipper of the invention comprises a nail clipper body having a rigidity and a suitable length to grip, and a lever mounted on an upper side of the body and a nail cutter mounted on a lower side of the body through a supporting shaft passing through a supporting shaft hole formed in one side end of the body. When a user grips the cutter, and rotates the cutter centering around the supporting shaft according to using direction, the cutter is rotated at a time within a range of 360° without interference of an obstacle to cut the nail at the desired angle. </p>

                        <p> TECHNICAL FIELD   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0001]    This invention relates to a nail cutter and a nail clipper using the nail cutter for cutting finger nails and/or toenails, and more particularly to a nail clipper comprising a nail clipper body having a rigidity, and a lever mounted on an upper side of the body and a nail cutter mounted on a lower side of the body through a supporting shaft passing through a supporting shaft hole formed in one side end of the body. The supporting shaft directly grips a lower end of the nail cutter while allowing for easily rotating the cutter relative to the body according to using direction, but preventing the cutter from rotating together with the lever upon rotating the lever, and preventing the cutter from freely rotating in use. The rotatable cutter allows for cutting nails at a desired angle by rotating right and left the cutter according to discrete steps, for rotating the cutter by each step of the rotation angle using means for increasing the rigidity and the cutter according to the flexible elastic motion of the cutter. A thin metal plate provides a simple assembling structure of the supporting shaft and the lever, and for removing separation defects of the supporting shaft.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          BACKGROUND ART   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0002]    The prior arts to which a nail clipper of the invention is directed are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,173,497, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. (Hei) 11-169227 (Jun. 29, 1999), U.S. Pat. No. 796,389, U.S. Pat. No. 806,037, U.S. Pat. No. 5,488,772, Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Publication No. (Sho) 57-27204 (Feb. 12, 1998), International Publication No.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> WO 02</span>/067720, and International Publication No.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> WO 02</span>/39844 (counterpart application: Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2002-142853).   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0003]    U.S. Pat. No. 6,173,497, which is related a rotation operating structure of a nail cutter applied to the invention, discloses a constitution that a jaw is connected to handles through hooked ends, and the jaw is rotated from the handles. However, according to the nail clipper of that invention, there is an inconvenience in that the two handles should be folded and unfolded upon use. Further, since the nail clipper has no structure for setting an angle of the cutter, there is no means for preventing the cutter from easily and freely being rotated upon using. Furthermore, in case that the jaw is made of a single piece construction, there is no means for making a flexible elasticity or for reinforcing rigidity. Also, since both levers are constituted to face each other at both sides when closing the jaw up and down, there has been an inconvenience for manipulating the rotation of the jaw.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0004]    A first embodiment of Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. (Hei) 11-169227 discloses a cutter or a jaw constituted to be rotated by a desired angle. However, since the cutter is inserted between an upper plate and a lower plate of a supporting member or a body, there has been an inconvenience that, upon rotating the cutter, a user pushes the cutter from the body using a finger, and then manipulates again the cutter to adjust to a desired revolution angle. Meanwhile, according to a second embodiment, since a lower part of the cutter is opened, the cutter can be directly rotated. However, since a rear end of the cutter is coupled to the body by a rivet, the rotation movement is not easily made. Further, if a user uses the nail clipper with the cutter rotated, since the user presses the lever with the body and the lever crossed each other, there have been drawbacks that the pressing motion is unnatural, and a force for cutting a nail is deflected.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0005]    U.S. Pat. No. 796,389 and U.S. Pat. No. 806,037 commonly comprise a cutter and a lever for manipulating the cutter. According to a structure of the cutter, since the cutter is made by simply bending a plate and forming a cutting blade of a front end thereof, a rigid structure of the cutter or an elastic flexible operation structure of the cutter is not disclosed. In such a case, there have been problems as follows.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0006]    In case of biting motion (motion for cutting a nail) of both blades by manipulating a lever, since the cutter is very thin, and thus has a weak rigidity, the cutter is bent, whereby the cutting force is weakly transferred. To prevent this, a plate thickness of the cutter should be increased. However, in such a case, since a center portion of the bent part becomes rigid, and thus a motion for pressing the cutter is not smooth, and a manipulation of the lever becomes difficult. Therefore, if the force for pressing the cutter is directly transferred to a blade portion, and acts as a shearing force, means for having opposite properties that the cutter should have a rigidity and a flexible elastic force is requested.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0007]    According to U.S. Pat. No. 5,488,772, a cutter has a sidewall projected from one side thereof. However, since this constitution is only for supporting a pin of a lever, and it is not for a reinforcing structure, the above problems discussed above with reference to U.S. Pat. No. 796,389 and U.S. Pat. No. 806,037 still remains.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0008]    According to Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Publication No. (Sho) 57-27204, upper and lower cutters have sidewalls at both sides thereof for the purpose of preventing a cut nail from scattering, respectively. However, since this constitution does not suggest a means for providing flexible elasticity, it is not practically used.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0009]    Further, International Publication No.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> WO 02</span>/067720 discloses a nail clipper having a cutter, and a lever for manipulating the cutter, but this constitution is not for rotating the cutter. Meanwhile, the cutter comprises an elastic part constituted by penetrating a circle hole in a center of a bent plate member, and a rigid part having a wide width and a slightly bent shape. However, in such a case, there have been problems as follows. In the process of manufacturing a nail clipper, a cutter has a high hardiness through a heat treatment process for endurance of a blade after a press process. In case of forming the upper and lower cutters by bending a center portion of the cutter, which is made of the material described above, having a short length, a stress pressing repeatedly upon using is concentrated upon the center portion of the bent part, specifically, the narrowest portion of the center portion. Thus, a breakage is easily generated, whereby the nail clipper cannot be used. According to the claims of that invention, number and size of hole requested for a proper resilience may be adjusted. Thus, this means that a proper resilience is provided. However, since the method for widely dispersing the repeated stress is not suggested, the breakage of the cutter due to the stress concentration phenomenon cannot be prevented. Further, in order to maintain a rigid section, a resilient section is extremely limited on the center portion of the bent part by forming a reinforcing rib between the center portion of the bent part and a wide end section. Thus, since a stress for making a biting motion (motion for cutting a nail) by folding the upper and lower cutters is concentrated upon a remaining portion of the minimum width centering around a hole of the bent part, there has been a problem that the expected life span of the cutter is considerably reduced.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0010]    Meanwhile, the prior art to which a hinge structure of a lever applied to the nail clipper of the invention is directed is disclosed in International Publication No.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> WO 02</span>/39844. According to the nail clipper disclosed in International Publication No.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> WO 02</span>/39844, oppositely disposed projections are a concave part formed with both side arms of the lever, a supporting shaft has a hooking groove formed by cutting off a part of both sides of an upper end of a cylinder, and the both projections serves to pulling the supporting shaft through leverage by assembling into the hooking grooves of the upper end of the cylinder. In such a case, a tension applied to the supporting shaft and the projection of the lever by leverage of the lever acts as a lateral force for biasing the projection toward the arm part, both arm parts are widened relative to each other, and thus there is a concern that they will be separated from the supporting shaft. Further, since the supporting shaft has the hooking groove formed by cutting off a part of both sides of an upper end of a cylinder, since, in case of enlarging the hooking groove, a remaining thickness of the cylinder should be reduced, the hooking groove cannot be enlarged, and thus the hooking part becomes considerably more fragile. In such a case, the projection of the lever can be separated from the supporting shaft even with some breakage or wear. This concern is greater when the lever is made of a plastic material.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION   </p>

                        <p>          [0064]    Here, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">supporting shaft  44</span>  connects both ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">projection shaft  43</span> , and has a smaller area than the cross area of the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">projection shaft  43</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0065]    Referring to FIGS. 2 a  and  3   a , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">supporting shaft  30</span>  connects and supports the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">lever  40</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span>  by being co-axially inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">supporting holes  11</span> ,  23  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span> . Thus, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">supporting shaft  30</span>  serves to transfer leverage force of the lever to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0066]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">supporting shaft  30</span>  comprises a head part  31 , which has a spherical shape, having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">hole  31</span>   a  in one end thereof for coupling with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">supporting shaft  43</span>  of the lever, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">divided surfaces  32</span>  formed by being divided and longitudinally extended from a center of the head part  31  for allowing fitting of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">supporting shaft  43</span> , a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">wedge hooking projections  33</span>  oppositely formed on internal surfaces of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">divided surfaces  32</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">hooking jaw  34</span>  formed at an end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">divided surfaces  32</span>  for hooking to a bottom surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">supporting shaft hole  23</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">wedge  35</span>  having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">hooking hole  35</span>   a  for engaging with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">wedge hooking projection  33</span>  by being fitted between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">divided surfaces  32</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0067]    Here, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">wedge  35</span>  has a shorter length than that of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">divided surface  32</span>  not to hinder the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">projection shaft  43</span>  from positioning in the head part  31  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">supporting shaft  30</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0068]    A method for assembling the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">supporting shaft  30</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">lever  40</span>  will be given herein below.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0069]    To begin with, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">supporting shaft  30</span>  is fitted to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">projection shaft  43</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">lever  40</span> . At this time, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">projection shaft  43</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">lever  40</span>  is inserted between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">divided surfaces  32</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">supporting shaft  30</span> , and then positioned within the head part  31 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0070]    Then, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">supporting shaft  30</span>  engaged with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">lever  40</span>  is inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">supporting shaft hole  11</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">supporting shaft hole  23</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span> . At this time, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span>  is assembled with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">click projection  25</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">upper cutter  25</span>  positioned in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">click groove  13</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">projecting site  14</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span> . By doing so, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">hooking jaw  34</span>  of the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">supporting shaft  30</span>  is exposed from the bottom surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lower cutter  26</span> . Then, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">wedge  35</span>  is inserted between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">divided surfaces  32</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">supporting shaft  30</span> , whereby the assembly is finished. At this time, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">hooking projection  33</span>  is engaged into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">hooking hole  35</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">wedge  35</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">hooking jaw  34</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">supporting shaft  30</span>  is widened, whereby the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">supporting shaft  30</span>  is not separated by being hooked from the bottom surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lower cutter  26</span>  in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0071]    Therefore, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">supporting shaft  30</span>  has a structure for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">divided surfaces  32</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">projection shaft  43</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">lever  40</span>  is engaged with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">divided surface  32</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">supporting shaft  30</span>  is not separated due to an engagement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">wedge  35</span> , whereby the assembly process is very simple, and a concrete structure after assembling is maintained.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0072]    Meanwhile, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipper  100</span>  of the invention may further comprise a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">nail handling tool  50</span> .   </p>

Here, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">general nail handling tool  50</span> A may be selected from any one of a small-sized knife, a small-sized scissors, and a file.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0078]    [0078]FIG. 13 b  shows another embodiment of the nail handling tool applied to the invention. Referring to FIG. 13 b , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">general nail handling tool  50</span> B is mounted in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">covers  10</span>   a ,  10   b , and then may be hinged to a rear end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper body  10</span> B by way of opening and closing by up and down rotation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0079]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper body  10</span> A,  10 B is provided with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">covers  10</span>   a ,  10   b  having <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">nail handling tools  50</span> A,  50 B at a lower part thereof, and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">covers  10</span>   a ,  10   b  is constituted as a part of the body by pushing them shut when they are not used.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0080]    An operation of the embodiment of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipper  100</span>  according to the invention will be given herein below.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0081]    To begin with, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipper  100</span> , as shown in FIG. 1, can be manipulated with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">lever  40</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span>  in parallel folded on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span> . At this time, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">lever fulcrum  41</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">lever  40</span>  is not directly contacted to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span>  with directed upwardly.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0082]    Although, under the above state, a user may use the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipper  100</span>  by first setting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span>  at a desired angle, it is preferable to manipulate the rotation angle of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span>  after lifting up the lever as shown in FIG. 2 a . This is resulted from that a rotation angle of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span>  is substantially changed more than ever during cutting a nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0083]    If a user lifts up and turns over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">lever  40</span> , and rotates it to an original position, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">lever  40</span>  is lifted up by a predetermined angle about the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span>  to make an about V letter type. At this time, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">lever fulcrum  41</span>  is contacted to an upper surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span>  adjacent to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">supporting shaft hole  11</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0084]    Here, the reason why, upon rotating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">lever  40</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span>  is not rotated by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">rotated supporting shaft  30</span>  is that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">click projection  25</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span>  is elastically engaged to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">click groove  13</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0085]    If, under the above state, the user is about to adjust an angle           of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span>  to a user&#39;s desired position, the user, as shown in FIG. 2 b , grips the both sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span>  by one hand with holding the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">lever  40</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span>  by the other hand, and then rotates the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span>  to set a desired angle. At this time, since the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span>  is opened in the lateral and lower directions, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span>  is easily adjusted to a free angle by a finer without an interference of an obstacle.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0086]    At this time, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">click projection  25</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span>  serves to set a rotation angle of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span>  each time the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">click projection  25</span>   a  arrives in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">click groove  13</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">body  10</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0087]    After manipulating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span>  to a desired angle, upon pressing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">lever  40</span> , the elastic section L of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">lower cutter  25</span> ,  26  is moved on the basis of the bent center part  24  by leverage of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">supporting shaft  30</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">lever fulcrum  41</span> , and then the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">cutting blades  21</span> ,  22  bites a nail to cut the nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0088]    At this time, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">reinforcing ribs  27</span> ,  28  serve to transfer a force obtained from the leverage to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">cutting blades  21</span> ,  22  without a loss. Further, at this time, when the trimmed nail is scattered in the lateral direction, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">reinforcing ribs  27</span> ,  28  serve to prevent the nail from scattering outside.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0089]    Therefore, according to the invention, since the free rotation angle of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">cutter  20</span>  is possible to be adjusted, a user can cut off nails conveniently even with a small motion without an inconvenience that the user should rotate the wrist or move the whole hand along the nail. Especially, in case that the user should cut the oppositely disposed toenail about one hand with the one hand, it is more useful.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0090]    Further, since the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">nail handling tool  50</span>  is received in the receiving part  10  of the body, when the user grips the nail clipper by one hand, the file plate is not contacted to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">file plate  55</span> , whereby the user feels a smoothness.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0091]    Further, since the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">projection shaft  43</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">lever  40</span>  is connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">supporting shaft  44</span>  which is not directly contacted to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">supporting shaft  30</span> , the concave part  42  is not widened, thereby it is not feared that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">supporting shaft  30</span>  is separated.   </p>

                        <p>        INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0109]    From the foregoing, according to the nail clipper exemplary embodiments of the invention, when rotating the cutter centering around the supporting shaft, a user directly grips a lower end of the nail cutter without an interference of an obstacle and easily rotates the cutter according to using direction. Further, the cutter is prevented from being rotated together with the lever upon rotating the lever, the cutter is prevented from being freely rotated in use, and the cutter is rotated right and left according to each step, whereby the user can cut nails conveniently at a desired angle.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0110]    Especially, since the nail cutter is made using a thin material, the material cost of the cutter can be considerably reduced. Further, since the life span of the pressing machine for working the cutter is increased, a cost reduction due to a mass production is possible. Furthermore, since the nail clipper made by bending the upper and lower cutters provides a flexible elasticity and prevents a stress concentration, a breakage of the bent center part of the cutter is prevented. Also, since reinforcing ribs are formed at both sides of the upper and lower cutters, a loss of cutting force of the cutter is restrained, and, additionally, the scattering of the trimmed nail is prevented.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0111]    Meanwhile, the assembly of the lever and the supporting shaft is simple, and since the supporting shaft of the lever is connected to both projection shafts, the projection shaft is not widened, and the lever is not separated from the supporting shaft, whereby an endurance of the product is considerably enhanced.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0112]    Further, according to the assembling process of the invention, to begin with, the head part of the supporting shaft is engaged with the projection shaft of the lever. Then, the supporting shaft is fitted into the supporting shaft holes of the body and the cutter. Then, if the wedge is inserted between the divided surfaces of the supporting shaft, the divided surfaces is widened, whereby the hooking jaw of the bottom part of the supporting shaft and the bottom surface of the cutter are hooked and coupled each other. Therefore, the assembly of the invention is very easy and secure, thereby removing a ground of inferiority of the product.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0113]    While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been described, it is to be understood that changes and variations may be made without departing the spirit or scope of the invention. Such changes and variations are intended to be within the scope of the invention and the appended claims. </p>
