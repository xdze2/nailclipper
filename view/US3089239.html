Lod</span></span></span>a, Ansonia, Conn, assignor to The H. (J. Cook Company, Ansonia, Conm, a corporation of Connecticut Filed June 22, 1962, Ser. No. 204,446 3 Claims. (Cl. 30142) This invention relates to cutting implements and more particularly to an improved combination nail clipper implement having a knife blade.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is the aim of the present invention to provide a novel combination nail clipper implement having a knife blade which is relatively simple and economical to manufacture, rugged in construction and in which the knife blade will not interfere with the operation of the clippers but will cooperate with the operating lever to maintain the elements in closed position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Other aims and advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent from the following detailed specification and the attached drawing wherein:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of a combination nail clipper implement having a knife blade which embodies the present invention and wherein the operating lever and knife blade are shown in phantom in their respective operative positions;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIGURE 2 is a plan view of the combination nail clipper implement of FIGURE 1;   </p>
                    
                        <p>  FIGURE 3 is a side elevational view thereof.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  FIGURE 4 is a rear elevational view thereof;   </p>
                    
                        <p>  FIGURE 5 is a front elevational View thereof;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIGURE 6 is a sectional view along the line FIGURE 3;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIGURE 7 is a plan view of the implement with the knife blade extended into operative position; and   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIGURE 8 is a side elevational view of the implement with the operating lever pivoted into operating position and showing in phantom the operating lever in an intermediate position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   I have now found that a highly effective and desirable combination nail clipper implement having a knife blade can be provided by an assembly wherein a knife blade has its shank portion pivotally mounted upon the fastener holding together the joined edge of the superposed jaw elements of the clipper together to extend along the upper surface of the upper jaw in its inoperative position and has a depending lug on the side edge of the shank opposite the knife edge so that when pivoted into extended or operative position, the lug will hold the knife blade relatively rigid during cutting. The operating lever for the clipper jaws which is pivotably mounted on a pivot pin intermediate the length of the jaw elements adjacent the jaw ends thereof has a depending lug on its side edge spaced from the knife edge intermediate the length thereof which engages in an aperture in the blade to lock the two elements together and restrict relative pivotal movement therebetween, the other side of the operating lever being spaced outwardly from the blade edge to provide a cover for the knife edge of the blade. In the preferred embodiment, a cooperating lug is provided on the edge of the lever opposite the locking lug to space the side of the lever and provide a guard for the knife edge.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring now in detail to the attached drawing, the combination nail clipper includes the superposed elongated jaw elements 2, 4 which h<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ave coo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">perating cutter jaws 6, 8 formed</span></span> at one end<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> thereo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">f and are secured toge</span></span>ther at the other end in overlying relationship by a rivet or other fastener 10. In accordance with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> conventional practice, the</span> jaw elements 2, 4 are preferably fabricated of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> a spri<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">ng steel an</span></span>d are formed to diverge towards their jaw ends so that the jaws 6, 8 normally will be biased apart, as be<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">st seen<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> in</span></span> FIGURES 3 and 5.   </p>
