                        <p>  To all lwhom it may conc-cm:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, HENRY LA Cassia, a citizen of the Unit-ed States of America, residing at Los Angeles, in the county of Los Angeles, State of California, have invented a certain new and useful Manicuring Device; and I do hereby declare the following to be a full, clear, and exact description of the invention, such as will enable others skilled in the art to which it appertains to make and use the same.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention relates to improved manicuring device, and it may be said to consist in the provision of novel and advantageous features and in the novel and improved construction, arrangement and combination of parts as will be apparent from the description and claims which follow hereinafter.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   One object of the invention is to provide a manicuring device made up of a comparatively small number of parts, and adapted for use to clip, clean, and file finger nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Further objects of the invention are to provide an improved manicuring device which is simple in construction, economical to manufacture, strong and durable, easily compacted to occupy a small space, of a neat appearance, effective in action, a-nd which may be carried about without injury to the clothes or person of the user.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Other objects and the advantages of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from a consideration of the following description of one form of device einbodying the invention, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings in which- Figure 1 is a central longitudinal sectional view of the. device with the cutting edge and supporting-face moved together; Fig. 2 is a similar view with the cutting edge and supporting face spaced from each other; Fig. 3 is an enlarged plan view of the device with the pivoted member moved to project forwardly of the jaws member; Fig. 4 is a longitudinal sectional view taken centrally of Fig. 3; Fig. 5 is a central longitudinal sectional view of the device with the pivoted member moved to lowered position on the jaws member; Fig. 6 is a cross-sectional view taken on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> line 6</span> 6 of Fig. 1; Fig. 7 is a cross-sectional view taken on the line 7-7 of Fig. 2; Fig. 8 is a front end elevation of the parts in Fig. 1, and Fig. 9 is a cross-sectional view taken on the line 9-9 of Fig. 5.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> integral aws member 10</span>, of resilient material, is formed to provide the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> upper jaw member 11</span> having at the forward end thereof the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutting edge 12</span> which is curved upwardly and rearwardly from the sides thereof, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> lower jaw-member 13</span> having at the forward end thereof the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> supporting face 14</span> which is curved upwardly from opposite sides there-of and extends a short distance forwardly of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutting edge 12</span> to prevent too close-cutting of the finger nails in practice.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Near the forward end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> member 13</span> is suitably secured the lower end of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> pin 15</span> Vwhich passes upwardly through an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> opening 16</span> in the forward end portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> member 11</span>; the length of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> opening 16</span> preferably Aheilig&#39; greater than the diameter of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> pin 15<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"></span> andthe upper portion 16</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> opening 16</span> being of gradually increased width.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Above the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> member 11</span> is pivotally and slidably mounted on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> pin 15</span> the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> member 17</span> which has<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> one end portion 18</span> thereof suitably formed for cleaning finger nails, and wh1ch has the downwardly and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> forwardly `extending projection 19</span> pressed out therefrom at the other end portion thereof thus forming the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> slot 20</span> which latter is of greater length than the diameter of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> pin 15</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> upper portion 21</span> of which is preferably vcountersunk to accommodate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> conical head 22</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> pin 15</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The underside of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> member 17</span> may be formed with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail filing surface 23</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   At its rear the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> member 11</span> has formed thereon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> spaced projections 24</span> which serve to hold therebetween and guard the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pointed portion 18</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> member 17</span> when the parts of the device are in compacted or disuse condition, and it is formed forwardly of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> projections 24</span> with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> depressed portion 25</span> which facilitates taking hold of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> member 17</span> to move it away from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> jaws device 10</span>, affords a good finger hold on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> jaws device 10</span> when the device is manipulated, and may be used to eHect contact between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> member<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">s 11 and 13</span></span> at a point intermediate their ends to attain greater effectiveness in action when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> member<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">s 11 and 13</span></span> are moved together in operation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> member 17</span> may be pulled upwardly and rearwardly on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> pin 15</span> from the position shown in Fig. 5 to have the end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> projection 19</span> disposed on the upper surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> aws member 10</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> recess 26</span> adj acent to the rear of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> openin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">g 16, 16</span></span>&#39;, see   </p>
