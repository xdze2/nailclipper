                        <p>   INVENTOR Jim/15s l3. fL-SW/d/K ATTORNEYS United States Patent 3,261<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">,093 CO<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem261">MBINED <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem93">NAIL CLIPPER AND KNIFE James B. Reswi</span></span></span>ck, 3229 Fairmont Blvd, Cleveland Heights, Ohio Filed Get. 21, 1964, Ser. No. 405,339 6 Claims. (Cl. 30--142) My invention relates to a combined tool providing nail-clipper and cutting-blade functions.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is an object of the invention to provide an improved device of the character indicated. Specifically, it is an object to provide such. a device with safety features assuring against exposure of sharp edges when folded to inoperative position and positively referencing the cutting blade when extended for use. It is also an. object to meet the foregoing objects with a tool of elemental simplicity and which is effective and foolproof in operation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Other objects and various further features of novelty and invention will be pointed out or will occur to those skilled in the art from a reading of the following specification in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. In said drawings, which show, for illustrative purposes only, preferred forms of the invention:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 1 is a view in perspective showing a preferred tool of the invention, the parts being folded into inoperative position;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 2 is plan view of the tool of FIG. 1, with the cutting blade swung to its extended or operative position;   </p>
                    
                        <p>  FIG. 3 is a side elevation of the tool of FIG. 1;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 4 is a view similar to FIG. 3 but showing the relation of parts when the jaw-actuating lever has been raised from inoperative position;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 5 is a plan view of the blank for the cutting blade element of FIG. 1;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 6 is a plan view of the element of FIG. 5, after forming to its ultimate shape;   </p>
                    
                        <p>  FIG. -7 is a left-end view of the element of FIG. 6;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 8 is a plan view of the blank for a modified form of cutting-blade element; and   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 9 is a plan view of the formed blank of FIG. 8, shown in assembled relation with parts of a clipper, parts of the latter being broken away and partly in phantom.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Briefly stated, the invention contemplates an improved combined tool featuring a conventional lever-actuated nail clipper with a cutting-blade element pivotally secured thereto, in such manner that the cutting edge of said element is secured in a safe protected position. when the tool is in inoperative condition, and in such manner that the cutting edge is positively referenced to the handle when the cutting-blade &#39;element is extended for use. The foregoing is achieved without in any way impairing nailclipper functions or effectiveness and without requiring any change in formation of standard nail-clipper parts.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring to FIGS. 1 to 7 of the drawings, the invention is shown in application to a standard nail-clipper construction, which happens to be of &#39;the swingable, reversible-lever type, exemplified in Bassett Patent 2,477,- 782. Thus, the illustra<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ted cli<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem477">pper comprises</span></span> opposed elongated jaw members 10-11 of stiflly yieldable material such as steel. J aw members 10-11 are connected as by spot-welding at one end, and they diverge to provide normally spaced cutting jaws 12-13 at the other end. A headed pin or rivet 14 passes through aligned <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">openings in the jaw mem</span>bers near the cutting jaws, and an actuating lever 15 is formed with a bridge 16 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">received in a slot </span>17 in the rivet 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">4, to hold</span> the parts in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">assemble</span>d relat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">ion.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   </span>If desired, and as also shown in said patent, a file member 18 may be pivotally connected by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">n eyelet 19 to </span>the connected end of the jaw memb<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">ers 10-11,</span> file member 18 being formed with spaced upstan<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">ding lugs 20 to</span> receive, locate a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">nd retain the free end of </span>the lever 15 when folded as in the position shown <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">in FIGS. </span>1 to 3. In this folded position, feet 21, which extend just beyond bridge 16, e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">ngage ja</span>w member 10 just beyond th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">e longitud</span>i<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nal location at which</span> bridge 16 engages rivet slot 17. J aw me<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">mbers 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">0-11, whe</span>n unstressed, are spre</span>ad apart much more than when assembled; therefore, in the assembled condition, the resilient stress or preload on jaw members 104.1 is reflected via bridge 16 a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">s a strong downw</span>ard 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">fjorce to urge the free </span>end of lever 15 against file mem- As noted above, lev<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">er 15 is </span>of the swingable, reversible type,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> meaning </span>that it must be reversed in order to perform its jaw-actuating function. This is done by raising lever 15 from the FIG. 1 position to t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">he FIG. 4 positio</span>n, and by then swinging the extended lever about the axis of rivet 14. This operation brings a bulbous lobe<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> or cam 2</span>2 into adjacency with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> top or outer surface o</span>f the upper jaw member 10, so that subsequent lever <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">depression cams the </span>cutting jaws 12-13 together, in conventional fashion.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In accordance with the invention, I provide a cuttingblade function for the described clipper, without requiring any change of clipper parts. The cutting implement is shown as .an elongated knife edge 23 formed at the cutt<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">ing end of a blade element 2</span>4, having at its other end a hu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">b 25, so that it </span>may be pivotally secured by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> eyelet</span> 19 to the outer surface of one of the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">aw members</span> 1011; preferably, &#39;eyelet 19 is tightly set, so that a good <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">measure of tors</span>ional friction characterizes the swinging action of both file 18 and blade member 24, each indepen<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">dently of the</span> oth<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">er.&#34; (In the</span> form of FIGS. 1 to 7, blade member 24 is secured to jaw member 11, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">nd in the form o</span>f FIGS. 8 and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">9, blade membe</span>r 24&#39; is secured to jaw member <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">10.)   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As best</span> seen in FIGS. 5 to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> 7, the blade </span>element 24 is formed from a flat blank, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">bent along crease</span>s 2627 to define an elongated lateral offset 28, which assures tha<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">t the blade 23 will be recei</span>ved in the space between<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> jaw memb</span>ers 10-11 when in inoperative position. The offset 28 also serves a dual-stop function, li<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">miting swi</span>nging movement of blade member 24 when moved to inoperative posi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">tion, and limiti</span>ng swinging movement of blade member 24 when moved to the extended or <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">operative positi</span>on (FIG. 2); at the first of these stop positions, offset 28 abuts the adjacent edge 29 of lower <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">jaw member</span> 11, and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">t the second of t</span>hes<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">e stop positions, of</span>fset 28 abuts the opposite edge 30 of jaw me<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">mber 11, i</span>n which ca<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">se firm reference</span> is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> established t</span>o the clipper body to enable the same to be an effective handle when cutting with edge 23.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is an important feature of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> inventi</span>on that means are provided for positive clamping retention of the blade member 24, when in inoperative position.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> This is accompl</span>ished by clamping the jaw members 1011 against opposed faces of blade 23 when handle 15 is set into folded ino<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">perative </span>posit<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">ion (FIG. </span>3). In this connection, it will be noted that in the inoperative position (FIG. 3) the cutting edges of jaws 1213 are spaced a distance d which is less than the distance d which applies when lever 15 is raised (FIG. -4). I so locate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">heel regi</span>on 31 of blade 23, in relation to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> thickness of b</span>lad<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">e 23 and </span>in relation to the varying spacin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">g of jaw </span>members 10-11 (as lever 15 is operated between the FIG. 3 and FI<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">G. 4 posi</span>tions) that the heel 31 will freely enter the space between ja<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">w member</span> 1011 when lever 15 is in the FIG. 4 position, but such t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">hat on th</span>e other hand the FIG. 3 position will establish an interference upon at tempted swinging entry of blade 23 into the space between jaw members 10<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">-11. unde</span>rstood that, if blade 23 is swung into closed position For <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">this relatio</span>nship, it will bewhile lever 15 is raised (FIG. 4), t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">hen subsequent lowering o</span>f lever 15 to the FIG. 3 position will involve c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">ammed cla</span>mping of jaw members -11 against the heel 31, assuring tight retention of the blade<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> 23 when</span> not in use. On the other hand, b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">y raising</span> lever to the FIG. 4 position, the clamp action is relieved, and finger actuation against the offset 28 or against the extended hub edge 32 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">will easil</span>y bring&#39;the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> blade 23 into opera<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">t</span>ive position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As a further feat</span>ure of the described embodiment, it will be noted that the structural relation of parts inherently permits effective retention of the blade in the event that the lever 15 has been lowered to its inoperative p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">osition (</span>FIGS. 1 and 3) before the knife blade 24 is swung into its inoperative p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">osition. In thi</span>s particular event, the heel 31 of the blade will interfere with the i<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">nner fac</span>es of the jaw members 10,11 as the heel enters the space<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> betwee<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">n these jaw</span></span> members. Finger pressure applied to flange 28 in the direction of closing the blad<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">e 24 to it</span>s inoperative position will nece<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ssarily l</span>ocally cam the jaw members 10, 11 slightly apart, thereby ass<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">uring p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">ositive fric</span></span>tional retention of the folded blade 24. It will be understood that th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">e extent of slig</span>ht jaw-spreading action achievable in this manner may be enhanced by slanting or tapering the heel 31 orientation in the direction of the hu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">b as ind</span>icated by the heavy dashed line 31 in FIG. 5.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In combine<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">d tools of the charac</span>ter indicated in which no. file or equivalent member 18 is desired, I pre<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">fer the embodmient of FIGS. 8</span>-9 which utilizes essentially the same blade member 24&#39; as described previously a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">t 24. The blade </span>member 24 is shown with primed notation <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">as to reference </span>numerals which correspond with those already described for blade member 24. T<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">he blade member 24&#39; is fastened by eyele</span>t 19 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">to the top surfa</span>ce of the upper jaw <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">member 10 </span>(there being no file membe<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">r 15 in FIG. 9<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">). and</span> the offset 28&#39; positions b</span>lade 23 for receptio<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">n in the s</span>pace <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">between jaw members</span> 10-11. In addition, for one location in the region of overlap between lever 15 and hub portion I provide locking mea<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">ns coacti</span>ng between these overlapping elements. The locking means is shown as spaced lugs 33-34 struck up from and out of the body of hub portion 25, the spacing being such as to r<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">eceive and loca</span>te lever 15 when folded, as shown in FIG. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">9. In this situa</span>tion, it will be appreciated that the clamping action on blade 23&#39; not only holds blade 23&#39; fir<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">mly in pl</span>ace w<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">hen lever 15 is in close</span>d position but also the lu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">gs 33-34 </span>are thus firmly referenced to provide equally firm retention reference for lever 15.  <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> </p>
                    
                        <p>   While I have described the invention in d</span>etail for the (preferred, forms illustrated, it will be understood that modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the claims which follow.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  I claim:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1. A combined tool, comprising opposed upper and lower elongated jaw members of stifily yieldable material connected at one end and having normallyspaced cutting jaws at the other end, a pivotally mounted operating lever for forcing the jaws together for a clipping operation and arranged to lie adjacent the top surface of the upper member when in inoperative position, said jaws being closer together when said lever is in inoperative position than when said lever is elevated into cutting position, and an elongated blade member-having a hub end pivotally connected to the connected end of said jaw members on the outer surface of one of said jaw members, said blade member having a blade end associated with said hub end via a lateral offset portion, whereby in inoperative position said blade portion may be swung into and received in the space between said jaw members and whereby in operative position said blade member may extend in the direction away from said cutting jaws, the thickness of said blade member being such in relation to the spacing of unconnected portions of said jaw members that when said lever is in elevated position a clearance exists for swinging movement of said blade member between said jaw members and that when said lever is lowered to said inoperative position said jaw members compressionally engage a part of the blade end of said blade member to retain the same should it then be between said jaw members.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2. A tool according to claim 1, in which said blade end includes an elongated cutting edge facing in the direction away from said lateral offset portion, said oifset portion being so located with respect to the blade pivot axis and to said cutting edge and to the adjacent edge of said one jaw member that in the inoperative position of said blade member said offset portion abuts said adjacent jaw-member edge to define a stop which assures against pivoting said blade member between said jaw members to such an extent that said cutting edge protrudes beyond the jawmember edge opposite said adjacent edge.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   3. A tool according to claim 2, in which said offset portion extends to a longitudinal position in proximity to the longitudinal location of the blade-pivot axis, Whereby when said blade member is swung to its extended operative position said offset portion may interfere with the opposite jaw-member edge to define a stop so that said jaw members may constitute a firm handle during use of said cutting edge.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   4. A tool according to claim 1, in which said blade-hub end is pivotally secured against the outer surface of the lower jaw member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   5. A tool according to claim 1, in which said blade-hub end is pivotally secured against the top surface of the upper jaw.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   6. A tool according to claim 5, in which said blade member and said lever have overplapping regions when in their respective inoperative positions, and in which said blade member and said lever haveinterengaging locking elements at the overlapping regions, whereby jawclamped retention of said blade member additionally provides positive retention against accidental swinging dislodgement of said lever when in inoperative position.   </p>
