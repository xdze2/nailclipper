                        <p>  COMBINATION TOOL Filed NOV. 28, 1952 INVENTOR.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  DA IS)&#34; sm/ml/wm A TTORNEY United States Patent COMBINATION TOQL Daisy Strickland, Titusville, Fla. Application November 28, 1952, Serial No. 323,021 1 Claim. (Cl. 13275.5)   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The present invention relates to a combination tool and it consists in the combinations, constructions and arrange ments of parts herein described and claimed.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Generally there is provided a combined nail scissors, nail files and tweezers all included in a single instrument. The tweezers are so constructed that when not in use they fold against the inner sides of the handles of the scissors and the handles themselves are made in the form of nail files thus providing an ideal instrument for carrying by ladies in their pocketbooks.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a novel combined nail file, nail scissors and tweezers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object of the invention is to provide a device of the character set forth which is simple in construction, inexpensive to manufacture and yet effective and eflicient in use.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object of the invention is to provide, in a device of the character set forth, novel pivoted tweezer members forming a part of the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Other and further objects of the invention will become apparent from a reading of the following specification taken in conjunction with the drawing, in which:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 1 is a plan view of an embodiment of the invention,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Figure 2 is a side elevational view thereof,   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 3 is an end elevational view of the device illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, and   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 4 is an enlarged fragmentary sectional view illustrating the manner of mounting a tweezer member forming a part of the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring more particularly to the drawing, there is shown therein a combined nail file, nail scissors and tweezers comprising a pair of scissors blades pivoted, as indicated at 11 with a preferably accurate pivotal construction and each of the blades having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> bowed handle 12</span>. The outer surfaces of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> handles 12</span> are formed as nail files, as indicated at 13, and the inner faces of each of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> handles 12</span> are provided, adjacent the outer ends thereof with a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cars 14</span> in each case.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Pivoted to each pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> ears 14</span> by means of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> pin 15</span> is an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> arcuately shaped tweezer arm 16</span> each of which is adapted to lie, when not in use, against the inner face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> associated arm or handle 12</span>, as indicated in dotted lines at 17, for example, in Figure 1 but each of which may be extended outwardly as shown in full lines in Figure l. The outer ends of each of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> tweezer members 16</span> may be pointed or squared as shown, for example, in Figure 2 at 18.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In operation, it will be apparent that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> blades 10</span> may be manipulated by means of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> handles 12</span> in conventional manner to utilize the same as nail scissors. It will also be apparent that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> outer surfaces 13</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> handles 12</span> may be utilized in conventional manner as nail files. Normally the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> tweezer members 16</span> will be pivoted upon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> pins 15</span> to their<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> dotted line position 17</span> as shown in Figure 4 but when it is desired to utilize the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> members 16</span> as a pair of tweezers, it is only necessary to extend the same to their full line position as shown in Figure 1 whereupon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> handles 12</span> may be manipulated to thereby move the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> members 16</span> toward or away from each other as desired and it will be apparent that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> end portions 18</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> members 16</span> may be utilized as tweezers in conventional manner.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   While but one form of the invention has been shown and described herein, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that many minor modifications may be, made without departing from the spirit of the invention or the scope of the appended claim.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  What is claimed is:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In a manicuring device including a pair of pivoted handles, a pair of arcuate tweezer arms hinged to the adjacent free ends of said handles to form a pair of tweezers when in extended position, said handles having concave inner surfaces adjacent their free ends, and said tweezer arms having their concave sides lying against the concave surfaces of said handles when in non-use position.   </p>
