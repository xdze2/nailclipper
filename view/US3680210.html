The lens is wide enough to cover both blades when their cutting edges are in abutting position, thus allowing the user to obtain a close magnified view of what he is cutting, with the dome-shaped element acting as a barrier to prevent pieces of clipped nail from being propelled into the face of the user.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  4 Claims, 6 Drawing Figures PATENTEDAUQ&#39; I I972 INVENTOR. CHARLES STEINMAN ATTOR PROTECTIVE MAGNIFYING ELEMENT FOR TOENAIL CLIPPERS This invention relates to improvements in clippers for toenails or the like, and in particular to toenail clippers of the type used in hospitals and doctors offices.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is common practice for doctors and nurses to cut the fingernails and toenails of patients who have suffered injury or undergone surgery in the vicinity of the nails, or who are incapable of cutting their own nails. For this purpose, a heavy-duty nail clipper is employed, and the doctor or nurse must observe the nail closely during the cutting operation in order not to injure closely patent.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   One of the major difficulties in utilizing the clippers is the difficulty in viewing the clipper blades for proper positioning of the clipper with relation to the nails, particularly where the surrounding area is damaged and is tender. Another problem in using the clippers is that after the nail is clipped, the shearing force applied often causes the clipped-off piece of nail to be propelled a significant distance so that it strikes the face of the user and sometimes lodges in his eye.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Accordingly, it is among the principal objects of the present invention to provide a protective magnifying element for toenail clippers which will allow the user to see an enlarged view of the portion of nail which he is clipping, allowing a more positive and correct cut, in less time.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object of the present invention is to provide a protective element, which will act as a barrier to prevent the cut nail from flying outwardly, away from the clipper and possibly striking the face of the user.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Still another object of the present invention is to provide an improved clipper of the character described which will allow much more efficient rapid use thereof, by removing the element of anxiety during the clipping process.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved protective magnifying element for toenail clippers which will be simple and inexpensive to manufacture, and yet be durable to a high degree in use.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention there is provided in a clipper device, a protective magnifying element. The clipper device generally consists of two pivoted arms terminating in blade portions having respective cutting edges which are movable between an open, separated position and a closed, cutting position in which the cutting edges abut each other. The magnifying element is secured to one of the blade portions and moves therewith toward and away from the other blade portion. The element has a convex upper surface and a concqve lower surface define a dome-shaped body which at least partially overlies the space between the separated cutting edges in the open position thereof so that the user may obtain a magnified view of the cutting edges and the nail or other article being cut. In the closed, abutting position of the cutting edges, the magnifying element is substantially centered thereon with the dome-shaped body providing an enclosure for containing the cut-ofi pieces of the article being cut, and for preventing said pieces from being propelled away from the clipper device.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is understood that while this invention is primarily directed to improvement in toenail clippers, it is also adaptable to clippers for fingernails, clippers for animals, and also clippers used for technical purposes, such as wire clippers.   </p>

                        <p>   In the type of clippers 12 illustrated herein, the blade por<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">tions 24, 26</span> each have a cutting edg<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">e 44 de<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">fined by a conc</span></span>ave upper su<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">rface 46 and a c</span>oncave lower <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">surface 48 shaped to simu</span>late t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">he general curvature of t</span>he toenail of an average user. It will be seen in FIG. 1, that when the blade portions 24, 26 are brought together in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> closed<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> or clipping po</span></span>sition with the cutting edges 44 in abutment with each other,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> the concave uppe</span>r surfaces 46 thereof come togeth<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">er to form an elliptical c</span>oncavity on the upper surface of the blade portions.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The nail clipper structure heretofore described is conventional and well known. In accordance with the invention herein, the nail clipper is also provided with the protective magnifying element 14 which serves<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> the dual purposes of acting as a</span> shield to stop the outward projection of clipped nail portions, as well as to magnify and present an improved view of the blades and nail during the clipping operation. The magnifying element has an elliptical shape, slightly larger in overall area then the aforementioned concavity 46, 46 in the upper <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">surface<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> of the blade portions 24</span></span> and 26. As shown in FIGS. 2<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">, 4, 5 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">and 6, the element</span></span> 14 is dome-shaped, having a convex up<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">per surface</span> 52 and a concave lower s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">urface 54. The element 1</span>4 may <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">be made of glass or trans</span>paren<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">t rigid pla</span>stic, and constitutes a domed, hollow magnifying lens.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   One edge portion of the lens element 14 is secured to the blade 23, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">long the outer e</span>dge 50 of the latt<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">er, by an</span>y suitable <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">means such as </span>cementing, fusing or the like. In this mounted position, the&#39;lens element 14 will move with the bl<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">ade 24 between the open </span>position of FIG. 3 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">and the c</span>losed position of FIG. 1. When the clippers is in the open position of FIG. 3, the lens element 14 partially overlies the space <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">between the sepa</span>rated cutting edges 44 so that the user m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">ay view the nail to be cut </span>through the lens element and properly position the blades with relation to the nail Thus, even where the cutting area is sensitive, the magnified view will minimize pain or injury to the patient.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   During the cutting operation, as the clippers are brought to their closed position of FIG. 1, the lens element 14 is moved toward the opposite <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">blade 26 until t</span>he cutting edges 44 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">come into abutment</span> to sever <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">the nail. In this</span> final position, the lens element 14 is located in registry with t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">he concavity 46,</span> 46 in the upper surface of blad<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">e porti<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">ons 24 and</span></span> 26. The lens element 14<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> thus p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">resents a hollow d</span></span>ome o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">verlying said co</span>ncavity so that any nail portion severed during the clipping operation will be contained within the enclosure formed by said concavity and the interior of the lens element, and cannot fly out to strike the user. It will thus be appreciated that the user can keep his face close to the clippers, to properly view the nail and blades, without fear that the cut nail portion will strike his face or lodge in his eye. In addition, the lens element serves as an enclosure to hold the cut-off nail pieces, which can be dropped out individually into a receptacle when the blades are opened after each cutting stroke.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As previously indicated, while the invention is particularly directed towards toenail clippers, it also finds use in connection with other types of clippers where it is necessary to view the section to be cut carefully, and where it is desired to provide a barrier to prevent cut pieces of materials cut from being propelled into the face of the user. Since the lens element is always of hollow, dome-shaped form, it may be used with other types of toe-nail or finger-nail clippers, in each instance serving as an enclosure to contain the cut-off pieces. While there has been described and illustrated a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is apparent that numerous, omissions, changes and additions may be made in such embodiment without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  What is claimed is:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1. In a clipper device having pivoted arms terminating in blade portions having cutting edges movable between an open, separated position and a closed, cutting position in which the cutting edges abut each other, a protective magnifying element secured to one of the blade portions and movable therewith toward and away from the other blade portion, said magnifying element having a convex upper surface and a concave lower surface defining a dome-shaped body which at least partially overlies the space between the separated cutting edges in the open position thereof, whereby said cutting edges and the article being cut may be viewed therethrough, said magnifying element being substantially centered above the abutting cutting edges in the closed position thereof, with the dome-shaped body and blade portions providing an enclosure for containing the cut-off pieces of the article being cut and for preventing said pieces from being propelled away from said clipper device.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2. A clipper device according to claim 1 in which the blade portions of said clipper device have respective concave upper surfaces continuous with said cutting edges, said concave upper surfaces defining a concavity on the upper surface of said blade portions when said cutting edges are in abutment in the closed position thereof, the dome-shaped body of said magnifying element being sized to overlie and completely cover over said concavity in the closed position of said cutting edges.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   3. A clipper device according to claim 2 in which said magnifying element is secured along one edge to the outer edge of one said blade potions remote from said other blade portion.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   4. A clipper device according to claim 3 in which said concavity on the upper surface of the blade portions is substantially eliptical and said magnifying element is so shaped and positioned that its lower edge lies within the confines of said concavity in the closed position of said cutting edges<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">. </p>
