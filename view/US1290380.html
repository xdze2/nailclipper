                        <p>  Application led May 27, 1918. Serial No. 236,690.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all &#39;whom t may concern Be it known that I, RICHARD SIMS, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Newark, county of Essemand State of New Jersey, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Nail-Clips, of which the following is a specification. t   </p>
                    
                        <p>  This invention relates to nail clips. v   </p>
                    
                        <p>   An object of the invention is to provide a clip of simple form which can be easily and cheaply constructed and which can be readily assembled and taken apart without the use of tools. t   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The invention further has for its object the improvement of devices of this character in a number of important respects, and with the foregoing and related objects in view, my invention consists in the parts, improvements, combinations and features of lconstruction herein set forth and claimed.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   ln the drawing forming part ofthis specific-ation and wherein the same reference numerals are uniformly applied to designate the same parts throughout, I have illustrated an embodiment of my invention for the purpose of adording a clear understandingV i thereof, but Jit is to be understood that the same is for the purpose of illustration only and not for limitation of the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In said drawing Figure 1 is a side view of the nail clip in closed position. Figs. 2 and 3 are-end views taken from opposite ends. Fig. 4 is a plan view. Figs. 5, 6 and 7 are longitudinal sectional views taken substantially on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> lines <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">5, 6, 7<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"></span></span></span> 5, 6, 7, Fig. 4, and showing different positions of the clip elements. Fig. 8 is a longitudinal sectional view taken substantially on the.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> line 8</span> 8, Fig. 4, and showing the preferred form of connection between the cutting elements of the clip. Figs. 9 and 10 are fragmentary bottom and top plan views of the operating lever which is also adapted to serve as a nail cleaner and nail file.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The nail clip of the present invention consists of but three principal elements, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">g elements 10 and 11</span></span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> lever 12</span>. There is also, in the form illustrated, a   </p>
                    
                        <p>  r fourth element, namely, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> pivoted hook member 13</span>, but other forms of retaining hooks may be made use of, as, for example, the end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> element 10</span> may be made into a retaining hook if desired.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Such three main elements are interchangeable and may be assembled without the use of tools, rivets or anything of the kind. To   </p>
                    
                        <p>  assemble, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> oifset end 14</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> cutting element 11</span> is introduced into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> opening 15</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> cutting element 10</span>, substantially as shown in Fig. 8, and is pressed downwardly against its tendency to spring upward so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">g surfaces 16 and 17</span></span> are brought substantially together, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> offset end 14</span> passing through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> opening 15</span> serving to position the cutting edges correctly opposite one another. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> lever 12</span> is then pushed downwardly and forwardly so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pivoting lugs 18</span> formed thereon enter the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> curved slots 19</span> provided for this purpose at each side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> member 10</span>. The spring action of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> member 11</span> serves to hold the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> lever 12</span> upwardly with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pivoting lugs 18</span> engaging against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> overha<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">nging hook portions 20, 20</span></span> formed above the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> slots <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">19, 19</span></span>. So assembled, the device is ready for operation and the parts will remain in the relative relations in which assembled until purposely disassembled, which may be done by substantially reversing the acti`on just described, pushing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> lever 12</span> downwardly and rearwardly to overcome the upward spring action of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> member 11</span> and withdrawing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pivoting lugs 18</span> from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> slots 19</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The device is operated in the usual manner by means of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> lever 12</span> which has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> bearing piece 21</span> contacting with the upper surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> member 11</span> and serving, when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> lever 12</span> is depressed, to force its cutting edge 1G downward against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> cutting edge 17</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> member 10</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   When a separate hook is provided it mayT be formed as shown at 22, of substantially U form with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> catch 23</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> pivoti<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ng lugs 24, 24</span></span>. The pivoted hook is permanently assembled to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> member 10</span> and this may be done by making the legs of the U-shaped portion thereof somewhat converging prior to assembly and the legs of the U-shaped member may be spread apart to cause the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> pivoting lugs 24</span> thereof to enter the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> openings 25</span> in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> thevmember 10</span>. Such openings are preferably provided in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> sidewall portions 26</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> member 10</span> which may also contain the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> slots 19</span> though, if desired, separate upward extensions of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> member 10</span> at the sides thereof may be provided for such purposes.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The under side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> lever 12</span> is preferably provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> file face 27</span> and the end thereof is preferably pointed as indicated at 28 to form a device for cleaning under hold`the-member12in open position for use asI-a filing and. cleaning tool.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   When the devicel is to&#39;y be. putv awayy as in the pocket, the lever l2<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> is pushed down againsttherspring member 11</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> catch 23</span> ofI the hook lengaged with the notch 30-in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> member 12</span> to retain theV parts in closed position as shown in Figs; 1 and2&#39;.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It will&#39; lie-&#39;understood that such terms as upwardly, forwardly, backwardly &#39;and thelike, as used herein, haverelative significancef only; v   </p>
                    
                        <p>  I-t&#39;will&#39; be seen: that a nail clip in accordance with my invention possesses numerousV features of&#39;fadvantage. The parts are interchangeable andwhen any thereof is broken it maybe replaced;I assembly and disassembly being accomplished by&#39; simple manual movements, the usual cost of assembly involving heading&#39;over of rivets and the like is substantially eliminated; when it is desired to sharpen the cutting knives they may be exposed for ready ing the device to pieces, and it can readily be reassembled after the sharpening operation is completed, and the operating lever, which, when open, serves the function of a nail file and cleaning tool, is positively held in such open position, substantially as in the case of the blade of an ordinary pocko: knife. l   </p>
