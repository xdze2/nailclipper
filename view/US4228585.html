                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A nail clipper for clipping the nails of an animal such as a dog, cat or the like which allows for the clipping of an individual nail at the desired length to prevent injury or improper length cutting for the animal. The device includes a hand-actuated clipping blade used in conjunction with an adjustable in size nail holder which allows the nail to be clipped to be firmly held at a particular position relative to the nail cutting blade. The nail holder and positioner includes a disc having a plurality of apertures of different diameters which is moveable to position a desired aperture of a particular size adjacent the cutting blade. With the varying diameter apertures, the animal nail may be inserted in each aperture until an aperture is found that permits the nail to penetrate a particular distance based on the diameter size of the nail, which is tapered. The proper aperture is determined which allows only penetration to the point equal to the desired length of the nail portion to be cut. The selected aperture is then moved into position relative to the cutting blade and the nail inserted a particular length and held firmly while the blade is actuated by hand. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This invention relates generally to a device for clipping individually each nail of an animal such as a dog or cat or the like, and specifically to an animal nail clipper that will securely hold the animal&#39;s nail relative to the clipping blade while providing for cutting the nail at the desired length.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Most animals dislike having their nails clipped. Oftentimes the animals squirm and move around making it difficult to clip off the desired amount. Should too much nail be clipped off, an animal can be injured resulting in pain and bleeding of the animal.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Various animal nail clippers have been shown in the prior art such as U.S. Pat. No. 2,955,354 issued to Laing and U.S. Pat. No. 3,838,507 issue to Clark. One of the great deficiencies in prior art clippers is that there is no provision for holding the nail with respect to the clipping blades in such a position to cut the desired amount of nail, to prevent cutting the nail too short, which may result in injury.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention overcomes this deficiency by providing hand actuated nail clippers for an animal which allow the user to clip the nail safely at the desired length while firmly securing it relative to the cutting blade during the cutting operation. This prevents the animal from squirming or moving while the nail is being cut since the nail is firmly held at the desired length relative to the cutting blade.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 2,955,354 issued to Laing employs a stop mounted above the cutting blade to prevent penetration through the aperture. The first problem is that the aperture does not firmly hold the nail since it is of a fixed size and secondly the arm that stops penetration of the nail is fixed relative to the blade opening such that there can be no compensation for variation between different animals as to the amount of length cut. The present invention, on the otherhand, insures that the nail is firmly held in the aperture relative to the blade opening, while at the same time the desired length of cut may be achieved while still permitting penetration only to a particular location.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A device for cutting nails of an animal such as a dog, cat, or the like comprising a first handle, a second handle connected to said first handle and pivotably moveable relative thereto, a cutting blade connected to said first handle and moveable and connectable to said second handle, a blade guide connected to said first handle, said blade being mounted to slide upon said blade guide, said guide having a large aperture for receiving an animal nail, and a nail holder mounted adjacent said blade guide.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The nail holder, in one embodiment, includes an arm connected to the first handle and a disc having a plurality of apertures disposed thereabout, each of said apertures having a different diameter, said disc being moveably mounted to said arm. The disc is mounted so that apertures in the disc can be moveably positioned such that the blade passes over the central axis of the aperture providing alignment of the nail holding aperture and the blade guide aperture. The blade, blade guide, and handles function in a conventional manner as far as the actual clipping of the nail. To operate the device, the nail to be clipped is inserted until a particular aperture is found which stops the penetration of a nail at a desired position relative to the blade. This is occasioned by the fact that the animal&#39;s nails are tapered and a particular aperture of the nail holder can be found which stops and holds the nail at a particular penetration distance. Once this aperture is found, then the aperture is moved to the blade area and the animal&#39;s nail inserted, arriving at the proper penetration distance which also acts to hold the nail. The nail is then clipped and removed and the clipping proceeds onto the other nails of the animal. Since these may vary in size, again the selection process of the various apertures is utilized.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is an object of this invention to provide an improved nail clipper for an animal such as a dog or cat that provides safety while clipping the animal&#39;s nails to prevent injury or harm to the animal.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is another object of this invention to provide a nail clipper which allows for adjustably achieving the cutting of an animal&#39;s nail at a desired length while firmly holding the nail relative to the clipping blade.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      But yet still another object of this invention is to provide an animal nail clipper which is readily used for various types of clipping blades which both holds and adjustably determines the length of the nail to be cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In accordance with these and other objects which will be apparent hereinafter, the instant invention will now be described with particular reference to the accompanying drawings.  </p>

The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">s 18 and 24</span></span>, as shown in FIG. 2 are pivotally connected by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> pin 26</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> Handle 24</span> is connected to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> blade 20</span> by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> linkage arm 32</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> pin 50</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> Spring 30</span> is connected to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> handle 18</span> by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> flange 40</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> linkage arm 32</span> which provides for the spring tension against the action of the handle. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> linkage arm 32</span> is connected to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> blade 20</span> by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> pin 48</span> which is received in slot 20b in the blade. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> disc mounting arm 28</span> is affixed by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> screws 38</span> to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> handle 18</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To operate the device, first the animal&#39;s paw is grasped and a determination is made as to the desired length of the animal&#39;s nail which is to be individually cut. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> disc 12</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> apertures 14</span> are utilized to select a particular aperture that permits only a certain amount of penetration of the nail due to the diameter size of the disc aperture selected and the diameter thickness of the nail, which is normally tapered. Thus the nail is inserted in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> particular aperture 14</span> and the amount of penetration is noted. This process is repeated until the proper and desired aperture is found which permits only penetration of the nail through the aperture in the disc a specific distance. Once the proper aperture is selected, the nail is removed and the disc is rotated to be coaxial with the blade mounting aperture. The nail is then inserted through the disc aperture and blade mounting aperture until it penetrates to the desired length and is held firmly there by the disc aperture. At this time, the handles are actuated, moving the blade causing the nail to be cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Thus, using the device, the nail will both be firmly held by the disc aperture of the proper size and at the desired length of nail to be cut. This eliminates any possibility of danger to the animal and prevents the animal from moving the nail during the cutting operation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The instant invention has been shown and described herein in what is considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment. It is recognized, however, that departures may be made therefrom within the scope of the invention and that obvious modifications will occur to a person skilled in the art. </p>
