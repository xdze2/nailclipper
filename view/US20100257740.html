A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem149">fulcrum  149</span>  is also seen on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lever  115</span>  for leverage.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]      FIG. 3   g  is the top view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  of  FIG. 3   h  whose viewed orientation is shown by an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem195">arrow  195</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">hook-like groove  122</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  seen in  FIG. 3   h  is for coupling the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lever  115</span> . The size of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">stopper  155</span>  at the other end away from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">hook-like groove  122</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  is a little bigger than that of the size of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">first supporting shaft hole  108</span>  for holding the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">two blade bodies  111</span> ,  112  between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">stopper  155</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lever  115</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  is disposed and confined in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">two supporting shaft holes  108</span> ,  109  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  is rotatable within a range of 360 degrees in the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">second supporting shaft holes  108</span> ,  109 . Very commonly seen in typical nail clipper, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">first supporting hole  108</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">first blade body  111</span>  is in round (or cylinder if the thickness of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">first blade body  111</span>  is taken into consideration) and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem109">second supporting hole  109</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">second blade body  112</span>  is not in round. By rotating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lever  115</span>  clockwise or counterclockwise centering around the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  can respectively rotate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">two holes  108</span>  and  109  clockwise or counterclockwise. By levering the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lever  115</span>  against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">second blade body  112</span>  will move the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">second blade body  112</span>  along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">first blade body  111</span>  bringing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103">two cutting edges  103</span>  and  104  respectively of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">two blade bodies  111</span>  and  112  into press contact with each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    The present invention is not so limited although the embodiment of the nail clipper of  FIG. 2   a  has shown that one end opposite to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103">first cutting edge  103</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">first blade body  111</span>  fixes with one end opposite to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103">second cutting edge  103</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">second blade body  112</span> . Another nail clipper shown in  FIG. 2   b  has shown that one opposite end to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103">first cutting edge  103</span>  of the first blade body fixes with the second blade body at nearly its middle location instead of its opposite end to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">second cutting edge  104</span> . In a more general form, any part of the first blade body can fix with any part of the second blade body and the first and second cutting edges respectively of the first and second blade bodies face each other to form a cutting mouth. The structure of the nail clipper of  FIG. 2   a  is more popularly adopted by current market.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    Another type of a nail clipper publicized by an USA patent number U.S. Pat. No. 7,020,964 titled as “Nail clipper and nail cutter, lever and supporting shaft for the same” includes one more member “nail clipper body” than that of the conventional nail clipper of  FIG. 1 . More detailed information of the patent can be referred to the patent number U.S. Pat. No. 7,020,964.  FIG. 8   a  is the side view of the nail clipper of which a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem888">nail clipper body  888</span>  is disposed between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem815">lever  815</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem812">blade body  812</span> . By levering the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem815">lever  815</span>  against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem888">nail clipper body  888</span>  will move the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem888">nail clipper body  888</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem812">second blade body  812</span>  along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem817">supporting shaft  817</span>  toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem811">first blade body  811</span>  into cutting finally.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    The types of the nail clippers revealed above have characterized that the distance between two cutting edges is fixed and is not adjustable. The distance between the first and second cutting edges respectively of the first and second blade bodies can also be called in short “cutting mouth” in the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    The cutting mouths of the existed nail clippers have been suitably designed for the thickness of healthy nail and they are sometimes are too narrow for rooming the fungus nail which usually grows thicker and more irregular than a healthy nail. If the cutting mouth has been designed to be large enough for the thick fungus nail then it will be inconvenient for precisely cutting thin and normal nail. If the cutting mouth has been designed for rooming healthy nail then it will be too narrow for the fungus nail. This means that a nail clipper with an adjustable cutting mouth is needed. Another advantage of a nail clipper with adjustable cutting mouth is that if the two cutting edges of a nail clipper can be adjusted to touch with each other or the distance between the two cutting edges is too small to room anything then the nail clipper will be much safer to children.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>

                        <p>          [0045]      FIG. 3   d  and  3   f  are respectively the front and back views of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lever  115</span>  shown in  FIG. 3   e  whose viewed orientations are respectively shown by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem193">arrows  193</span>  and  194 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lever  115</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem196">hole  196</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem195">thin support  195</span>  for coupling with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  through its a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">hook-like groove  122</span>  shown in  FIG. 3   h . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem149">fulcrum  149</span>  is also seen on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lever  115</span>  for leverage.  FIG. 3   g  is the top view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  of  FIG. 3   h  whose viewed orientation is shown by an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem195">arrow  195</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">hook-like groove  122</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  seen in  FIG. 3   h  is for coupling the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lever  115</span> . The size of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">stopper  155</span>  at the other end away from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem122">hook-like groove  122</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  is a little bigger than that of the size of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">first supporting shaft hole  108</span>  for holding the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">two blade bodies  111</span> ,  112  between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">stopper  155</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lever  115</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0046]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  is disposed and confined in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">two supporting shaft holes  108</span> ,  109  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  is rotatable within a range of 360 degrees in the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">second supporting shaft holes  108</span> ,  109 . Very commonly seen in typical nail clipper, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">first supporting hole  108</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">first blade body  111</span>  is in round (or cylinder if the thickness of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">first blade body  111</span>  is taken into consideration) and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem109">second supporting hole  109</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">second blade body  112</span>  is not in round. By rotating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lever  115</span>  clockwise or counterclockwise centering around the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  can respectively rotate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">two holes  108</span>  and  109  clockwise or counterclockwise. By levering the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lever  115</span>  against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">second blade body  112</span>  will move the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">second blade body  112</span>  along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">first blade body  111</span>  bringing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103">two cutting edges  103</span>  and  104  respectively of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">two blade bodies  111</span>  and  112  into press contact with each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0047]    The present invention is not so limited although the embodiment of the nail clipper of  FIG. 2   a  has shown that one end opposite to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103">first cutting edge  103</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">first blade body  111</span>  fixes with one end opposite to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103">second cutting edge  103</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">second blade body  112</span> . Another nail clipper shown in  FIG. 2   b  has shown that one opposite end to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103">first cutting edge  103</span>  of the first blade body fixes with the second blade body at nearly its middle location instead of its opposite end to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">second cutting edge  104</span> . In a more general form, any part of the first blade body can fix with any part of the second blade body and the first and second cutting edges respectively of the first and second blade bodies face each other to form a cutting mouth. The structure of the nail clipper of  FIG. 2   a  is more popularly adopted by current market.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0048]    Another type of a nail clipper publicized by an USA patent number U.S. Pat. No. 7,020,964 titled as “Nail clipper and nail cutter, lever and supporting shaft for the same” includes one more member “nail clipper body” than that of the conventional nail clipper of  FIG. 1 . More detailed information of the patent can be referred to the patent number U.S. Pat. No. 7,020,964.  FIG. 8   a  is the side view of the nail clipper of which a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem888">nail clipper body  888</span>  is disposed between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem815">lever  815</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem812">blade body  812</span> . By levering the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem815">lever  815</span>  against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem888">nail clipper body  888</span>  will move the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem888">nail clipper body  888</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem812">second blade body  812</span>  along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem817">supporting shaft  817</span>  toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem811">first blade body  811</span>  into cutting finally.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0049]    The types of the nail clippers revealed above have characterized that the distance between two cutting edges is fixed and is not adjustable. The distance between the first and second cutting edges respectively of the first and second blade bodies can also be called in short “cutting mouth” in the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0050]    The cutting mouths of the existed nail clippers have been suitably designed for the thickness of healthy nail and they are sometimes are too narrow for rooming the fungus nail which usually grows thicker and more irregular than a healthy nail. If the cutting mouth has been designed to be large enough for the thick fungus nail then it will be inconvenient for precisely cutting thin and normal nail. If the cutting mouth has been designed for rooming healthy nail then it will be too narrow for the fungus nail. This means that a nail clipper with an adjustable cutting mouth is needed. Another advantage of a nail clipper with adjustable cutting mouth is that if the two cutting edges of a nail clipper can be adjusted to touch with each other or the distance between the two cutting edges is too small to room anything then the nail clipper will be much safer to children.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0051]    For all the types of the nail clippers revealed in the present invention, at least a portion of the supporting shaft is threaded and at least the threaded portion of the supporting shaft is in cylindrical shape, and the inner wall of the supporting shaft hole of a blade body the most away from the lever is threaded and in cylindrical shape, and the threaded portion of the supporting shaft and threaded inner wall of the first supporting shaft hole are screwed with each other clockwise or counterclockwise to adjust the distance between the first and second cutting edges. To perform the screwing motion, the threaded inner wall of the supporting shaft and the threaded portion of the supporting shaft are in cylindrical shape although the present invention is not so limited.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0052]      FIG. 4  has shown the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  of  FIG. 3   h  of which a portion, marked by  450 , adjacent to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">stopper  155</span>  side is threaded and at least the threaded portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  is in cylindrical shape for screwing with the threaded inner wall of the supporting shaft hole. By using the nail clipper of  FIG. 2   a  as an example, the inner wall of the first supporting shaft hole is threaded and the threaded supporting shaft of  FIG. 4  is disposed through the first and second supporting holes respectively of the first and second blade bodies, which has been shown in  FIG. 5 , although the threads of the inner wall are not visible in  FIG. 5 . And further, by rotating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lever  115</span>  centering around the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  clockwise or counterclockwise can rotate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">coupled supporting shaft  117</span>  clockwise or counterclockwise resulting in screwing the threaded supporting shaft and the first supporting shaft hole together clockwise or counterclockwise to adjust the cutting mouth.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0053]    Due to the thickness of the blade body may be too thin for being built with enough threads on the inner wall of its supporting shaft hole the thickness of a portion or all of the blade body may be increased to enlarge the threading area of the inner wall of the supporting shaft hole. By using the nail clipper of  FIG. 5  as an example,  FIG. 6   a  has shown a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem611">thickened body  611</span>  of the first blade body of the nail clipper. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem611">thickened body  611</span>  on the left of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">first blade body  111</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">first supporting shaft hole  108</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">first blade body  111</span>  are seen in  FIG. 6   a .  FIG. 6   b  is the front view of the nail clipper of  FIG. 6   a .  FIG. 6   c  has shown a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem612">thickened body  612</span>  is on the right of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">first blade body  111</span>  and  FIG. 6   d  is the front view of the nail clipper of  FIG. 6   c .  FIG. 6   e  has shown a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem613">thickened body  613</span>  is at both sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">first blade body  111</span>  and  FIG. 6   f  is the front view of the nail clipper of  FIG. 6   e.     </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0054]    A side facing out of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">stopper  155</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  or the end facing out away from the hook-like groove of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  can also be carved for the screwdriver to rotate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  to adjust the distance between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103">two cutting edges  103</span> ,  104 . For example, the side facing out of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">stopper  155</span>  can be carved as flat or Phillips screw types which are respectively shown in  FIG. 7   a  and  7   b . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  of the nail clipper of  FIG. 2   a  and  2   b  can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise either by rotating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lever  115</span>  centering around the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  or by a screwdriver operating on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem155">carved stopper  155</span>  or the end away from the hook-like groove of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  clockwise or counterclockwise resulting in adjusting the cutting mouth of the nail clipper.  </p>

The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem815">lever  815</span>  is positioned on an upper side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem888">nail clipper body  888</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem811">first blade body  811</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem812">second blade body  812</span>  are positioned on a lower side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem888">nail clipper body  888</span> . The first, second and third supporting shaft holes are not visible in the drawing but marked with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem835">numbers  835</span> ,  834  and  833  by their respective locations seen in  FIG. 8   a . By levering the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem815">lever  815</span>  against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem888">nail clipper body  888</span>  moves the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem888">nail clipper body  888</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem812">second blade body  812</span>  along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem817">supporting shaft  817</span>  toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem811">first blade body  811</span>  bringing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem803">two cutting edges  803</span> ,  804  respectively of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem811">two blade bodies  811</span> ,  812  into press contact with each other finally.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0056]    Similar to the embodiment of  FIG. 5 , for the nail clippers of  FIG. 8   a , at least a portion of the supporting shaft is threaded and at least the threaded portion of the supporting shaft is in cylindrical shape, and the inner wall of the supporting shaft hole of a blade body the most away from the lever is threaded and in cylindrical shape, and the threaded portion of the supporting shaft and threaded inner wall of the first supporting shaft hole are screwed with each other clockwise or counterclockwise to adjust the distance between the first and second cutting edges. To perform the screwing motion, the threaded inner wall of the supporting shaft and the threaded portion of the supporting shaft are in cylindrical shape although the present invention is not so limited.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0057]    By using the nail clipper of  FIG. 8   a  as an example,  FIG. 8   b  has shown that a portion of the supporting shaft, marked by  850 , and the inner wall of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem835">first supporting shaft hole  835</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem811">first blade body  811</span>  are threaded and both are screwed together. By rotating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem815">lever  815</span>  centering around the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem817">supporting shaft  817</span>  clockwise or counterclockwise results in adjusting the distance between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem803">two cutting edges  803</span>  and  804 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0058]    A side facing out of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem855">stopper  855</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">supporting shaft  117</span>  or the end facing out away from the hook-like groove of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem817">supporting shaft  817</span>  can also be carved for the screwdriver to rotate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem817">supporting shaft  817</span>  to adjust the distance between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem803">two cutting edges  803</span> ,  804 . For example, the side facing out of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem855">stopper  855</span>  can be carved as flat or Phillips screw types which are respectively shown in  FIG. 7   a  and  7   b . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem817">supporting shaft  817</span>  of the nail clipper of  FIG. 8   b  can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise either by rotating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem815">lever  815</span>  centering around the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem817">supporting shaft  817</span>  or by a screwdriver operating on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem855">carved stopper  855</span>  or the end away from the hook-like groove of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem817">supporting shaft  817</span>  clockwise or counterclockwise resulting in adjusting the cutting mouth of the nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0059]    Due to the thickness of the blade body may be too thin for being built with enough threads on the inner wall of its supporting shaft hole the thickness of a portion or all of the blade body may be increased to enlarge the threading area of the inner wall of the supporting shaft hole. By using the nail clipper of  FIG. 8   b  as an example, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem892">thickened body  892</span>  of the blade body the most away from the lever of the nail clipper is seen in  FIG. 8   c . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem892">thickened body  892</span>  on the left of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem811">first blade body  811</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem835">first supporting shaft hole  835</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem811">first blade body  811</span>  are seen in  FIG. 8   c .  FIG. 8   d  has shown a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem891">thickened body  891</span>  is on the right of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem811">first blade body  811</span> .  FIG. 8   e  has shown a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem890">thickened body  890</span>  is at both sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem811">first blade body  811</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0060]    A nail clipper with its two cutting edges adjusted to touch with each other when not in service provides better safety to children. By using the nail clipper of  FIG. 6   a  as an example,  FIG. 9   a  has shown its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103">two cutting edges  103</span> ,  104  are screwed to touch each other.  FIG. 9   b  is the nail clipper of  FIG. 9   a  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">lever  115</span>  returned to its non-working position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0061]    The present invention is not limited to any particular coupling between the lever and the supporting shaft. The present invention is not limited to any particular coupling between the lever and the nail clipper body. The present invention is not limited to any particular shape and size of the supporting shaft hole of the blade body more adjacent to the lever. For example, for all kinds of the nail clippers revealed in the present invention, the supporting shaft hole of a blade body more adjacent to the lever doesn&#39;t have to be in cylindrical shape. </p>
