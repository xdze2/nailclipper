                        <p>  NAIL-CLIPPER.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Application filed October 16, 1908, Serial No. 457,995.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  T 0 all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, IIERMAN Lnrnnwnnnn, a citizen of the United States, residing at South (lineage, in the county of Cook and State of Illinois, have invented a new and useful Improvement in NailClippers, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My invention relates to improvements on the device in common use for cutting fingernails, involving a pair of cutting-jaws on the ends of handles compressible in the hand of the operator for working the jaws.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the accompanying drawing, Figure 1 shows my improved device in the preferred embodiment of its detailed construction, by a view in side elevation and with the jaws in their closed condition; Fig. 2 is a top plan view of the same; Fig. 3 is a view like that presented in Fig. 1, but showing the device in condition for nail-clipping, with the jaws open, and Fig. 4, a similar view, but showing the operating lever turned to its extreme position for use as a nail-file; Fig. 5 is a top plan view of the device in its condition represented in Fig. 1; Fig. 6 is a broken view presenting the jaws in front elevation; Fig. 7 isa section on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> line 7</span>, Fig. 3, showing the tapering form of the movable cutting-jaw, and F ig. 8 is a broken section on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> line 8</span>, Fig. 5, showing the pivotal construction of a loop detail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the preferred form of the device shown, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> two ha<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">ndles 9 and 10</span></span> are united, being formed of a strip of spring steel bent upon itself to cause the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> handle 10</span> to extend normally at a suitable inclination relative to the companion-handle and form the movable spring-retracted member of the device. However, it is not essential to my invention that the handles shall be united nor that they shall involve any spring-action. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> handle 9</span> terminates at its forward end in an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> expanded jaw 11</span> consisting of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> base-portion 12</span> and an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> upturned concave bluntedged cutting-lip 13</span> slightly thinned or tapered toward its ends. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> handle 10</span> contains a bend, forming a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> depression 14</span>, near its forward end which terminates in an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> expanded jaw 15</span> having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> blunt-edged cutting-lip 16</span> extending from it, of concave shape conforming to that of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> lip 13</span>, to coo erate with the rear portion of the edge of tie latter for exerting the punching function hereinafter described in the manner of a cutting-die. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> yoke 17</span> embraces the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> handle 9</span> adjacent to its jaw, being let into Specification of Letters Patent.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Patented Sept. 13, 1910.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Renewed April 9, 1910. Serial No. 554,530.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   the recessed edges of the handle, and the arms of the yoke are similarly let into the edges of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> handle 10</span> at the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> depression 11</span>, beyond which is fulcrumed between said arms the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cam-shaped end 18</span> of an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> operating lever 19</span> to cause the cam to engage the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> arm 10</span> at said depression. The under side of this lever is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> file-surface 20</span> and its free end is shown at 120 to be pointed to adapt it for nail-cleaning. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> loop 21</span> is provided to extend from the outer face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> lever 19</span>, being pivotally supported in the ends of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> cross-head 22</span> pivotally fastened between its ends to the lever as represented in Fig. 8, and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem121"> similar loop 121</span> is secured in the same manner on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> handle 9</span> near its rear end. To retain the device in its normal condition represented in Fig. 1, namely, with the jaws closed, wherein it is most compact, to adapt it to be carried in a pocket of the users clothing, the pivotal loop on the lever may, on depressing the latter, be turned on its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> support 22</span> to surround the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">s 9 and 10</span></span> near their rear or joined ends, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem121"> loop 121</span> being turned to lie against the outer surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> handle 9</span>. These loops, however, perform another function hereinafter described, for which they are adapted to be rotated by the pivotal connection of the cross-heads carrying them respectively with the operating lever and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> handle 9</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   To use the device, the described construction adapts it to be operated as follows, with the parts in the condition in which they are TUIH&#39;GSCIltOCl in Fig. 3: The operator inserts his thumb into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> loop 21</span> and a finger of the same hand, preferably the middle finger, into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem121"> loop 121</span>, the loops thus holding the device in the operators hand and their pivotal connection with the device enabling the latter to be turned, as indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 3, to any desired angle relative to the operators thumb and finger for facilitating access with the cutting-jaws to any part of a finger or toe nail to be clipped by working the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> lever 19</span> to actuate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> jaw 15</span>. In the operation of the device, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> jaw 1</span>.1 and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> handle 9</span> form the stationary member and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> jaw 15</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> handle 10</span> form the movable member. The stationary jaw performs, as one important function, that of a stop, by inserting its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> lip 13</span> underneath the nail being trimmed to gage the extent to which it may be cut by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> jaw 15</span>, and the thinned ends of that lip render accessible to it the corners of nails by adapting it to be inserted chopping action on the nail which tends to underneath them. With the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaw 11</span> thusl applied to a nail to be trimmed, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> lever 19</span> is operated to cause the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cam 18</span> upon it to depress the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> arm 10</span> and thus actuate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> jaw 15</span> to cut the nail to the extent gaged by the stop-function of the companion-jaw. It will be observed that the cooperation of the aws is in the nature of punching as applied to die-cutting, inasmuch as the initial action of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> blunt-edged cutter 15</span> upon the nail is to bend it over the edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> cutter 11</span>, and then to punch it against the latter, thereby rounding off the cut edge. This is an important advantage, since where, as in a form of nail-clipper known to me and in common use, the cutting edges meet coincidently in working the jaws they exert a split it; and this tendency is not wholly obviated by av mere shearing action of a sharpedged cutting-jaw unless it exert the diecut provided for in my improved construction. The action of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cam 18</span> is gaged to prevent an extent of the cutting stroke of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> jaw 15</span> which would engage the cutting edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> lip 16</span> with the base of the stationary jaw and thereby tend to dull that edge.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   WVhile a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> nail-file 20</span> on the operating lever in a nail-clipper in the class to which my invention relates is not new with me, it is myimprovement in that connection to afford to the lever in the desirable straight position thereof of presenting its filing-surface for use, as represented in Figs. 5 and 6, a support sufficiently stable to resist the opposing pressure in using the file. In the construction illustrated the desirable degree of rigidity is afforded by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cam 18</span> finding, at the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem118"> point 118</span> thereof, bearing against the back of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> jaw 15</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   IVhat I claim as newand desire to secure by Letters Patent is- 1. In a nail-clipper of the character described, a relatively stationary member provided with a blunt-edged stop-forming cutting-j aw, and a member movable relative to said stationary member and provided with a blunt-edged cutting-jaw cooperating simultaneously throughout its length with said stop-jaw to exert a die-punching cut ting action, for the purpose set forth.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2.
