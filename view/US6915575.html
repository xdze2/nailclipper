                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> The cutting tool, in particular nail clippers, comprise two elongated members hinged around an axis (A), wherein each member is provided with an actuating arm and a cutting edge; the cutting edges of the two elongated members face each other so as to reciprocally co-operate for cutting when they are moved towards one another by the action of approach on the actuating arms. The tool also comprises elastic means for biasing the elongated members towards a diverging condition in which the two actuating arms and the two cutting edges are spaced from one another, and retaining means for holding the elongated members in a closed condition, in contrast with the elastic means. According with the present invention, the retaining means comprises a threaded pin, which is adjustably inserted in screwing engagement in a threaded hole formed through a first of the two elongated members and is provided with a manually actuable head and with an end opposed the head, in front contact engagement into a retaining seat formed in the second of the two elongated members. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> This application claims priority to European Application Number 02425032.6.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The present invention relates to a cutting tool, in particular, to nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Tools of this type are known, that include two elongated members hinged around an axis, wherein each member is provided with an actuating arm and a cutting edge; the cutting edges of the two elongated members face each other so as to reciprocally co-operate for cutting when they are moved towards one another by the action of approach on the actuating arms. There are also provided elastic means for biasing the elongated members towards a diverging condition in which the two actuating arms and the two cutting edges are spaced from one another, and retaining means for holding the elongated members in a closed condition, in contrast with the elastic means.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The retaining means keeps the tool closed when at rest, thereby preventing the toolâ€”if left by itselfâ€”from having the cutting edges in an exposed position, so as to constitute a potential danger for someone who could inadvertently touch such edges.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The most widespread retaining means typically comprise a variedly shaped lever that hooks between the actuating arms, thus preventing them from diverging.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    However, such retaining means are relatively difficult to be actuated. In fact, the tool is often left in diverging and thereby dangerous condition. Moreover, known retaining means are not provided with intermediate positions, that is, such as to allow adjusting the maximum diverging condition. Such adjustment would be particularly useful above all to facilitate use for users with small hands, for whom it is currently difficult to grip the tool when in diverging condition.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Object of the present invention is to provide a tool with improved retaining means, which allows easy actuation, preferably allowing the adjustment of the maximum diverging condition.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Accordingly, the present invention relates to a cutting tool, preferably nail clippers, comprising two elongated members hinged around an axis, wherein each elongated member is provided with an actuating arm and a cutting edge, wherein the cutting edges of the two elongated members face each other so as to reciprocally co-operate for cutting when they are moved towards one another by the action of approach on the actuating arms, also comprising elastic means for biasing the elongated members towards a diverging condition in which the two actuating arms and the two cutting edges are spaced from one another, and retaining means for holding the elongated members in a closed condition, in contrast with the elastic means, characterised in that the retaining means comprises a threaded pin, which is adjustably inserted in screwing engagement into a threaded hole formed through one of the two elongated members, and is provided with a manually actuable head and with an end opposed the head, in front contact engagement in a retaining seat formed into the second of the two elongated members.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The threaded pin head is easily actuable in rotation by the user, who can thus adjust the position of the pin into its hole; pressing the pin thoroughly into the hole locks the two actuating arms due to the front engagement of the same pin into its seat.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Preferably, the retaining seat is a groove linearly extending as an arc, the groove having an inclined bottom, so as to have a variable depth between a maximum, at one of its end portions that is positioned in front of the threaded hole when the elongated members are in closed condition, and a minimum, at one of its end portions that is positioned in front of the threaded hole when the elongated members are in a totally diverging condition.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    This solution allows adjusting the maximum diverging condition of the elongated members: the more the pin is pushed thoroughly into the hole, and thus into the seat, the less the possibilities of the elongated members of diverging.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Preferably, in order to facilitate manual actuation, the threaded pin head is knurled.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Preferably, the threaded pin is substantially parallel to the hinging axis. In this way, the holding action efficacy is maximum, since the relative motion between pin and retaining seat is perpendicular to the pin axis itself.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The two elongated members can be reciprocally hinged in various ways, so as to define first-, second- or third-class levers. Preferably, the two elongated members are crossed with one another at the hinging axis, each elongated member having an operating arm opposed the actuating arm with respect to the hinging axis, the cutting edges being formed onto such operating arms. The tool thus has a first-class lever structure, particularly effective for cutting.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Also the elastic means can be of various types, provided that it ensures the action of return of the elongated members towards the diverging condition. Preferably, the elastic means comprises a spring compressed between facing portions of the actuating arms. This solution ensures the utmost simplicity and efficacy.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Such spring preferably has opposed ends housed into respective seats formed in the actuating arms, so as to ensure a safe arrangement.  </p>
                    
                        <p>  </p>

Similarly, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">member  3</span>  comprises an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">operating arm  8</span>  and an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">actuating arm  9</span> , at opposed sides with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">hinging screw  4</span> ; the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">operating arm  8</span>  comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">cutting edge  10</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">Cutting edges  7</span>  and  10  are opposed to one another, so as to allow the cutting action of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail clippers  1</span> ; the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">two actuating arms  6</span>  and  9  are opposed to one another as well, so as to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">allow handling nail clippers  1</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> </p>
                    
                        <p>    Nail clippers  1</span>  further comprise elastic means for biasing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">elongated members  2</span>  and  3  towards a diverging condition ( FIGS. 1 ,  3  and  3   a ) wherein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">two actuating arms  6</span>  and  9  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">two cutting edges  7</span>  and  10  are spaced from one another. Such elastic means comprises, for example, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">helical spring  11</span> , compressed between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">seats  12</span>  and  13  provided in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">portions  14</span>  and  15  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">actuating arms  6</span>  and  9 , which are close to axis A, but sufficiently spaced from it to ensure a sufficient lever arm for the operation of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">spring  11</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> </p>
                    
                        <p>    Nail clippers  1</span>  further comprise retaining means for holding the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">elongated members  2</span>  and  3  into a closed condition in contrast with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">spring  11</span> . Such retaining means comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">pin  16</span> , having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">knurled head  17</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">threaded stem  18</span>  and an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">end  19</span>  opposed to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">head  17</span> ; <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">pin  16</span>  is adjustably inserted in screwing engagement into a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">threaded hole  20</span>  formed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">elongated member  2</span> , and its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">end  19</span>  engages frontally into a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">seat  21</span>  formed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">other elongated member  3</span> , in front of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">hole  20</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">Seat  21</span>  is a groove which linearly extends as an arc and has an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">inclined bottom  22</span> , with a variable depth between a minimum (at an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">end portion  23</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">seat  21</span>  that is placed in front of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">threaded hole  20</span>  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">elongated members  2</span>  and  3  are in totally diverging condition) and a maximum (at an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">end portion  24</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">seat  21</span>  that is placed in front of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">threaded hole  20</span>  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">elongated members  2</span>  and  3  are in closed condition).  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">end  19</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">pin  16</span>  is adjustably protruding from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">hole  20</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">towards seat  21</span> ; such adjustment can be obtained by simply acting in rotation on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">knurled head  17</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    In use, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">two elongated members  2</span>  and  3  can take a closed condition ( FIGS. 2 and 2   a ), or a diverging condition in a more or less marked way ( FIGS. 1 ,  3 ,  3   a ). In closed condition, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">cutting edges  7</span>  and  10  are in substantial contact, thus determining the cutting action. In diverging condition, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">two arms  6</span>  and  9  can be more or less spaced from one another, according to the position of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">pin  16</span> : the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">more pin  16</span>  protrudes from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">hole  2<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">0</span>  into seat  21</span> , the closer the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">two arms  6</span>  and  9 . When at the limit, with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">pin  16</span>  at the maximum protrusion, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">two arms  6</span>  and  9  are kept locked in closed position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Thus, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail clippers  1</span>  achieve the aforementioned object, allowing both easy closure and adjustment of the diverging condition of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">arms  6</span>  and  9 , everything by the simple manual actuation of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">pin  16</span> . </p>
