Bassett, Woodbridge, Conn. Application June 16, 1953,=Serial No. 361,970   </p>
                    
                        <p>  1 Claim. (Cl. 132-755) This invention relates to nail clippers and the like, particularly to that type of nail clippers in which a pair of flexible jaw members are secured together at one end and have cutting jaws at the other end normally held open by the resilience of the jaw members, and   </p>
                    
                        <p>  the invention is especially intended as an improvement over the clipper shown in my Patent No. 2,477,782, granted August &#39;2, 1949. This application is a continuation-in-part of my application Serial No. 172,077, filed July 5, 1950, now Patent 2,664,624, January 5, 1954.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">this fo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem664">rm of c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem624">lipper,</span></span></span> a cam lever is operatively connected to the jaw members &#39;by having a cross bar on the end of the lever extend through an undercut slot in a pivot pin extending loosely through the jaw mem bers. The resilient pressure of the jaw members which causes them to normally spread apart also presses the cross bar into the undercut portion of the slot to retain the lever in operative position to manipulate the clipper. Such clippers usually have a nail file pivoted to the jaws, and the operating lever and file may have coacting means to hold the lever in place against turning. a   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The principal object of the invention is to provide a nail clipper having a folding nail file movable from inoperative to operative position having an improved arrangement for retaining the file in inoperative position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   With the foregoing and other objects in view, I have devised the construction illustrated in the accompanying drawing forming .a part of this specification. It is, however, to be understood the invention is not limited to t-heispecific details of construction and arrangement shown, but may embody various changes and modifications within the scope of the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In this drawing:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 1 is a plan view of a nail clipper illustrating one form of the invention;   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Fig. 2 is a side elevation of the clipper shown in Fig. 1;   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Fig. 3 is a transverse section on the line 33 of Fig. 1;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 4 is a view simila<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">r to Fig</span>. l but showing the operating lever extended and illustrating a nail file attachment embodying one of the features of the invention;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 5 is an enlarged, sectional view taken in the plane of the line 5-5 of Fig.1;   </p>
                    
                        <p>  &#39; Fig. 6 is a view similar to Fig. 5 but illustrating a modification; and   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 7 is a view similar to Fig. 5 but illustrating a further modification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This improved clipper comprises two superimposed cutter jaw members 10 an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">d 11 wh<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">ich are preferably stamped from sheet metal </span></span>of fairly heavy gauge of any desired shape, but preferably of the substantially oblong shape shown, and which are secured in superimposed relation at one end portion by any suitable means, such, for example, as spot welding 12. These members are provided at<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> their opposite </span>ends with cutter jaws 13 and 14, the free edge portions <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">of whic<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">h are provided </span></span>with cutting or knife edges 15 and 16 opposed to ea<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">ch othe<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">r so that. when forced tog</span></span>etheron opposite sides of a finger- 2,738,795 Patented Mar. 20, 1956 nail, toenail, or the like, they will trim .it to the shape of these cutting edges, the free ends of the jaws being preferably ofiset from the members 1011 and inclined toward each other somewhat, as shown in Fig. 2, whereby those portions of the members 10-1-1 adjacent the jaws 1314 are spaced apart. These jaws 13-14 are normally held open, as shown in Fig. 2, and this may be done by various means, but preferably either one or both&#39;of the members 10 and 11 are spring members, or made <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">of resi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">lient metal</span></span>, which tend to assume this open position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The means for operating these jaws and their cutting or knife edges comprises a pin 17 extending through aligned openings 18 a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">nd 19 i</span>n the jaws, with i<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">ts head<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> 19a on the under si</span></span>de of the lower jaw .and its shank extending through the upper jaw to a distance above this jaw, this shank being provided in one side with a curved transverse undercuit; recess or notch 20 opening through a side of t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">he pin providing at</span> its top an inverted curved hook portion 20 inwhich is sea<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">ted a transverse bar 22 at the e</span>nd of an operating l<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">ever 23. This bar </span>is provided by cu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">tting an opening 24</span> in this lever spaced a suitable dis<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">tance back </span>from the adjacent end, and this end of the lever is bentdownwardly as shown at 25 in Fig. 2, to restagainst the top of the upper jaw member 11, so that the spring action<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> of the jaws will te</span>nd to swing the free end of the lever 23 downwardly against the top of the upp<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">er jaw me</span>mber into the inoperative position, this action being secured by the lever action on the ends of the curved portion 25, and the bar 22 seating in t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">he end of the notc</span>h 20 in t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">he pivo</span>t pin. The leveris also pr<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">ovided wi</span>th an upwardly pressed lug 26 a short distance from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">the pin 17, the end 27 o</span>f which when the lever is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">reverse</span>d may<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> rest o</span>n the top of the upper jaw member 11 for operation of the cutte<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">r in the clipping op</span>eration. In moving this lever to this position, it is raised from the position of Figs. 1 and 2&#39;about its pivot bar 22 to the position of Fig. 4 and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">n is swung in</span> a circle about the pin 17, the pin during this movement turning i<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">n the j</span>aws as a pivot for the lever to permit the lever to be swung to the operative position over the upper bar &#39;11 in which position it &#39;is reversed or turned over from the position of Figs. land 2, so thatthe lug 2 6 is on the underside<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> of the</span> <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lever, and its fr</span>eeedge 27 rests on the top of the upper jaw <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">member 11, a</span>s will be understood, th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">e bar 22 of the leve</span>r remaining in the undercut <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">notch 2</span>0 of the pivot pin and forming<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> a pivot for the l</span>ever. Now, by pressing downwardly the free end of the lever 23, the lug 26 will force the upper jaw <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">member 11</span> down<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">wardly </span>or toward the o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">ther jaw member 10, </span>and will force the cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">g or knife edges 15 </span>and 16 together for <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">the cli<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">pping -or trimming operati</span></span>on. After use, the lever 23 may be swung again to the position of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> Fig. 4, </span>using the pin 17 as a pivot, and then swung to the inope<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">rative </span>position on top of the jaw member 11 as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. If de<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">sired, the und</span>er side of the lever (which is the upper side when the lever is in the operative position), may be cut or roughened, as shown at 29, to form a better grip for the thumb when using the device. Also it is preferred that the end portion of this lever be bent slightly as shown at 37a, Fig. 2. This brings the portion 37 between this point and the free end<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37"> 28 on a pl</span>ane substantially parallel <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">with the bod</span>y of the clipper, when the lever is depressed into the position where the cutting edges grip and cut the nail, so that the thumb pressure&#39;is exerting a force on the part 37 rather than on the sharp end of the lever. This bend also raises the free end 28 of the lever above the member 30 w<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">hen in the f</span>olded position of Figs.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> 1 and 2 t</span>o provide a clearance under this free end, as   </p>
                    
                        <p>   3 shown at 38, for insertion of a thumbnail to facilitate raising the lever.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Through the rear ends of the jaw members and 11 is formed an opening whereby the device may be connected to a key ring, chain or the like, and pivotally mounted at this end is a nail file 30. This is a flat blade member cut <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">on either or </span>both surfaces, to form the file 31, and it may be reduced in thickness an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">d rounde</span>d or pointed at its free end 32 to provide a means for cleaning un<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">der the nail</span>. The file is pivotally mounted on the upper side of the upper jaw member 11, as by means ofan eyelet 3<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">3 passing through op</span>enings <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">in the members 10 and</span> 11, and rolled over at its oppo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">site en<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">ds to form </span></span>securing flanges 34. This eyelet also pas<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">ses through an opening in</span> the file member 30 to form a pivotal mounting for <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">this member to </span>allow it to be swung in a plane substantially parallel to the plane of the members 10 and 11 to a folded position on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">top of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">the upper m</span></span>ember 11 when not in use, or to be swun<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">g laterally, as </span>shown in Fig. 4, to a more exposed position for use. When in the position on the top of the member 11, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, it lies <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">under and </span>is covered by the operating lever 23, so that it is protected an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">d prevented from ca</span>tching on clothing or other objects.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The lever 23 and file member 30 preferably have co<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">acting me</span>ans <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">to hold the lev</span>er in place against lateral swinging. In the form shown, the opposite side edges of this file member adjacent the pivot 33 are provided with upwardly extending <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">lugs 35 b</span>etween which the f<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">ree end portion of the leve</span>r 23 may seat and be held when in the clos<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">ed or ino</span>perative position of Figs. 1 and 2 and is prevented from being swung from this position when being carried or not in use. A lug or bump 36 on the under side of the nail f<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">ile 30, which m</span>ay be formed by punching <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">through from </span>the top side, or in any other way, frictionally engages the adjacent face of the upper jaw member 11 and is raised slightly aga<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">inst the spring acti</span>on of the metal of the file to frictionally retain the file in the folded position, as shown in Fig. 3, so that the file is thus held against inadvertent movement laterally out of its closed position but can be readily swung to the operative extended position for use. The frictional retaining lug 36 on the nail file 3<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">0 provides the necessary fri</span>ction f<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">or holding th</span>e file in folded position without in any way affecting the simplicity of manufacture or case of assembly of the clipper parts. The frictionally held file 30. through the lugs 35<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">, holds the lever 23 again</span>st sidewise s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">winging.</span>   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> form sho</span>wn in Fig. 6, the upper jaw member 11 is provided with a dimple <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">or depression 40 to </span>receive the lug or <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">bump 36 on the file and </span>thus hold the f<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">ile 30 more sec</span>urely than when friction alone<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> is reli</span>ed upon as n the form shown in Figs. 1 to 5.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the form shown in Fig. 7, the upper jaw member 11 is provided with an upstan<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">ding lug or projecti</span>on 41 to be received<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> in a hole, dimple or depression</span> in the file member 30 so that the file is held quite <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">securely agains</span>t swinging, as in the form shown in Fig. 6.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It should be noted that the holes, dimples and lugs are such that the file may be manually swung to operative or inoperative positions without undue effort, but the file is not likely to be swung out of position, accidentally. It will be clear that the more firmly the file is held, the more firmly will the lever 23 be held against accidental swinging. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">  </p>
                    
                        <p>   It sh</span>ould also be understood that if no nail file is provided, the top jaw member and operating lever could be provided with the cooperating projections and dimples the same as those on the jaw member and file, to prevent accidental swinging of the lever on the jaw.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   While the invention has been described in considerable detail and preferred forms illustrated or described, it is to be understood that various changes and modifications could be made within the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claim.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  I claim:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In a nail clipper, a pair of relatively resiliently movable jaw members connected together at one end and having offset cutting jaws at the other ends, means including a jaw operating lever for moving said jaws for cutting, said lever being pivoted for lateral swinging about a pivot adjacent said cutting jaws, said lever when in inoperative position being positioned along one of said jaw members, a nail file member pivoted to said jaw members for lateral swinging movement, the pivotal axes of said operating lever and nail file member being substantially parallel, said nail file member and adjacent jaw having cooperating lateral abutment means to resist lateral swinging of said file member on its 21djacent jaw and said lever and file member having abutment means to resist relative lateral swinging movement.   </p>
