                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> The present invention is a nail clipper that comprises a reusable handle assembly and a disposable blade assembly, a method for assembling the nail clipper, and a method for replacing the disposable blade assembly. The handles and the blades are releasably coupled when connector portions on the end of the handles are inserted into cavities in the bases of the blades, where a detent secures the handles to the blades. The handles can be detached from the blades by depressing an actuator lever that forces the detents out of their securing position to allow a new set of disposable blades to be connected to the reusable handles. </p>

                        <p> TECHNICAL FIELD  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    This invention relates to a nail clipper apparatus with reusable handles and disposable blades, a method to assemble such apparatus, and a method for replacing the disposable blades.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    Prior art nail clippers have been designed in various forms, including types resembling pliers or shears, types using a compound lever, types using a grip-operated lever, and types designed to stand on a table top. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. D489,844 (pliers type), 5,701,672 (complex action), 4,644,644 (shear type), 4,176,449 (grip-operated), and 4,564,034 (table top handle).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    Some prior art nail clippers disclose removable or replaceable blades or cutting members. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,331,739, 806,037, and 1,976,067. The blades disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,331,739 and 806,037 are formed from one piece of metal that has a loop or is U-shaped. The blades in U.S. Pat. No. 5,331,739 are connected to the handles or arms by snapping a hinge into a notch. The blades in U.S. Pat. No. 806,037 are connected to the handles or arms by “fingers” and are removed by drawing a pin from its place. The cutters disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 1,976,067 are H-shaped and have two sets of blades, one set for right-hand and one set for left-hand nail-cutting. These prior art nail clippers have disadvantages that are overcome by the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0004]    The present invention is a nail clipper having reusable handles and disposable blades that are releasably coupled. One end of each handle includes a connector portion fitted with a detent. The base of each blade has a chamber and an adjacent receiving cavity to hold the detent. The handles and blades can be detached by depressing actuator levers, one on each side of the base of the blades. The levers cause actuator presses to compress the detents into the connector portions, so that the connector portions of the handles can be withdrawn from the blades. Assembly of the handles and blades can be achieved by inserting the connector portion into the chamber. The side walls of the chambers will force the detents to compress into the connector portions until the position of the detents is even with the receiving cavities, and the detents can emerge into the receiving cavities and secure the coupling.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    These features reduce replacement costs for a user, who only has to replace the blades instead of the entire nail cutter. Additionally, in a salon setting, the ability to use different blades for different clients provides a hygienic advantage by reducing risks of infection and transmitted diseases. Moreover, the secure fit between the reusable handles and the disposable blades affords great utility to the present novel nail clipper and also affords ease of assembly and disassembly.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    The present invention also includes a method for assembling the nail clipper of the present invention and a method for replacing the disposable blades.  </p>

The inner surface of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">each handle faces space  38</span> . The inner surface of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">first handle  26</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">first section  30</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">second section  32</span> . The inner surface of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">second handle  28</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">first section  34</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second section  36</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">Second sections  32</span>  and  36  are proximate to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">disposable blade as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">sembly  24</span>  while first sections  30</span>  and  34  are further from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">disposable blade assembly  24</span> , such that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">second sections  32</span>  and  36  are between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">first sections  30</span>  and  34  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">disposable blade assembly  24</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0018]    As shown in  FIG. 6 , at one end of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">first handle  26</span>  is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">connector portion  54</span> , and at one end of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">second handle  28</span>  is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">connector portion  56</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">Detent  58</span>  is housed, preferably by being spring-loaded, into the lateral edge of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">connector portion  54</span>  that is facing away from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">space  38</span> . Likewise, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">detent  60</span>  is housed, preferably by being spring-loaded, into the lateral edge of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">connector portion  56</span>  that is facing away from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">space  38</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">Connector portions  54</span>  and  56  are used to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">releasably couple handles  26</span>  and  28  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">disposable blade assembly  24</span> . This novel apparatus affords both great utility and ease of assembly and disassembly. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]    Nail clipper  20</span>  can be disclosed in a closed position as shown in  FIGS. 1-4 ,  6 , and  7 - 9  or in an open position as shown in  FIG. 5 . As shown in  FIG. 1 , on the inner surface of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">first handle  26</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">abutmen<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">t  42</span>  protrudes into space  38</span>  from in between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">first section  30</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">second section  32</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">Abutmen<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">t  42</span>  anchors<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> fulcrum  44</span>  upon which spring  40</span>  is mounted and rotates. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">Spring  40</span>  initially resides in a first position adjacent to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">first section  30</span>  of the inner surface of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">first handle  26</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">which causes nail clipper  20</span>  to be in the closed position as shown in  FIGS. 1-4  and  6 - 9 . As shown in  FIG. 5 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">spring  40</span>  can rotate on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">fulcrum  44</span>  to a second position such that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">end cap  46</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">spring  40</span>  rests on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second section  36</span>  of the inner surface of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">second handle  28</span> . When <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">spring  40</span>  is in this second position, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">it biases blades  48</span>  and  50  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">nail clipper  20</span>  in an open position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]    As shown in  FIG. 1 , attached to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">handles  26</span>  and  28  is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">disposable blade assembly  24</span> , which has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">first blade  48</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">second blade  50</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">Blades  48</span>  and  50  are pivotally mounted on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">pivot pin  52</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">Blades  48</span>  and  50  can counter-rotate against one another <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">about pin  52</span> . As shown in  FIGS. 4 and 5 , on one side of the blade, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">first blade  48</span>  has <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">concave surface  78</span> , and similarly, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">second blade  50</span>  has <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">concave surface  80</span> . These concave surfaces afford cutting strength and close access of the cutting line to the nail being cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]    As shown in  FIG. 6 , at the base of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">first blade  48</span>  is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first chamber  70</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">into which connector portion  56</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">second handle  28</span>  is inserted. Adjacent to one lateral edge of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first chamber  70</span>  is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">first receiving cavity  74</span> , which is preferably a semi-circular cavity that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">receives detent  60</span> . Also as shown in  FIG. 6 , at the base of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">second blade  50</span>  is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">second chamber  72</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">into which connector portion  54</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">first handle  26</span>  is inserted. Adjacent to one lateral edge of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">second chamber  72</span>  is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">second receiving cavity  76</span> , which is preferably a semi-circular cavity that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">receives detent  58</span> . When <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">detents  58</span>  and  60  are set in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">receiving cavities  76</span>  and  74 , respectively, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">reusable handle assembly  22</span>  is secured via releasable coupling to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">disposable blade assembly  24</span>  as shown in  FIGS. 1-5  and  7 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">Although detents  60</span>  and  58  are preferably spherical, they can be of any geometric shape sufficient to afford a secure and releasable fit with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">corresponding receiving cavities  76</span>  and  74 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]    As shown in  FIG. 6 , on the exterior lateral surface of the base of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">first blade  48</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">actuator lever  62</span>  is connected to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">actuator press  66</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">Actuator press  66</span>  penetrates through the side of the base of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">blade  48</span>  and is positioned at <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">first receiving cavity  74</span> . On the exterior lateral surface of the base of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">second blade  50</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">actuator lever  64</span>  is connected to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">actuator press  68</span>  as shown in a partial cross-sectional view in  FIG. 6 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">Actuator press  68</span>  penetrates through the side of the base of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">blade  48</span>  and is positioned at <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">second receiving cavity  74</span> . As an alternative embodiment shown in  FIG. 8 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">actuator levers  62</span>   a  and  64   a  can face toward the handles instead of toward the blades. This embodiment would enable a user to depress the actuator levers without the need to reposition his or her hand on the handles. If a user desires to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">remove disposable blade assembly  24</span>  from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">reusable handle assembly  22</span> , then the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">user may depress actuator lever  62</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">which causes actuator press  66</span>  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">enter first receiving cavity  74</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">release detent  60</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">connector portion  56</span> , thereby releasing and disengaging the coupling and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">allowing second handle  28</span>  to be detached from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">first blade  48</span> . The user may, either simultaneously or in different order, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">then depress actuator lever  64</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">which causes actuator press  68</span>  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">enter second receiving cavity  76</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">release detent  58</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">connector portion  54</span> , thereby releasing and disengaging the coupling and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">allowing first handle  26</span>  to be detached from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">second blade  50</span> . The user can thus <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">simultaneously depress actuator levers  62</span>  and  64  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">quickly remove both handles  26</span>  and  28 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]    If a user desires to attach <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">a replacement disposable blade assembly  24</span>  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">reusable handle assembly  22</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">connector portions  54</span>  and  56  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">handles  26</span>  and  28  are <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">insertable into chambers  70</span>  and  72  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">a replacement disposable blade assembly  24</span> . The side walls of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">chambers will force detents  58</span>  and  60  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">compress into connector portions  54</span>  and  56  until the connector portions have been inserted deep enough into the chambers that the position of the detents is even with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">receiving cavities  74</span>  and  76 . At this <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">point detents  58</span>  and  60  can decompress and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">emerge into receiving cavities  74</span>  and  76 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">Once detents  58</span>  and  60  are <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">set into receiving cavities  74</span>  and  76 , the coupling between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">reusable handle assembly  22</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">disposable blade assembly  24</span>  is secure. Preferably, the ends of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">actuator press  66</span>  and  68  are designed to correspond with the shape of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">detents  58</span>  and  60  as shown in  FIGS. 8 and 9 .  FIG. 8  and  FIG. 9  differ in the orientation of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">actuator levers  62</span>  and  64 . Also preferably, as shown in  FIG. 9 , the side walls of the chambers have <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82">guiding grooves  82</span>  and  84  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">guide detents  58</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> 60  into receiving cavities  74</span>  and  76 . The guiding groove provides the user with the ability to insert a handle into a chamber without having to take time to first orient the handles and the blades. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    Handles  26</span>  and  28  are preferably manufactured using a durable metal compound, such as steel. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">Blades  48</span>  and  50  are preferably manufactured using a disposable metal compound or a disposable plastic compound. The type of material used is preferably recyclable.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]    The present invention also includes a method of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">assembling nail clipper  20</span> . A user desiring to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">assemble nail clipper  20</span>  <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">would select reusable handle assembly  22</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">would select disposable blade assembly  24</span> . The us<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">er would then insert connector portions  54</span>  and  56  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">handles  26</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> 28  into chambers  70</span>  and  72  at the bases of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">blades  48</span>  and  50 . This <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">step causes detents  58</span>  and  60  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">compress into connector portions  54</span>  and  56 . The user would then continue to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">insert connector portions  54</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> 56  into chambers  70</span>  and  72  until the position of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">detents  58</span>  and  60  is even with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">receiving cavities  74</span>  and  76 . At this <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">point detents  58</span>  and  60  decompress and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">emerge into receiving cavities  74</span>  and  76 , thereby securing the coupling between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">reusable handle assembly  22</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">disposable blade assembly  24</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]    Another aspect of the method is the replacement of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">disposable blade assembly  24</span> . A user desiring to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">replace disposable blade assembly  2<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">4</span>  would depress actuator levers  62</span>  and  64  to cause the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">connected actuator presses  66</span>  and  68  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">compress detents  58</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> 60  into connector portions  54</span>  and  56 , thereby releasing the coupling. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">user would then withdraw handles  26</span>  and  28  from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">blades  48</span>  and  50 , ther<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">eby detaching disposable blade assembly  24</span>  from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">reusable handle assembly  22</span> . The user would then attach <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">a replacement disposable blade assembly  24</span>  as previously described. Preferably, the user could hold the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">blade assembly  24</span>  as depicted in  FIG. 8  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">simultaneously depress actuator levers  62</span>   a  and  64   a  so as to afford a fluid method of replacement. Thus, as a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">user places blade assembly  24</span>  in one hand, the hand simultaneously slips over <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">actuator levers  62</span>   a  and  64   a  such that the grasping force both holds the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">blade assembly  24</span>  and depresses the actuator levers. </p>
