                        <p> A nail clipping device with warning functions is disclosed, including: a nail clipper with arc-shaped cutting edges; a capacitive sensing module, located below the arc-shaped cutting edges of the nail clipper, enables measurement of the distance between the arc-shaped cutting edges of the nail clipper and the flesh below the nail; a warning module, located above the arc-shaped cutting edges of the nail clipper; and a control module, located at the lower portion of the device, and coupled to the capacitive sensing module and the warning module, capable of pre-setting a warning distance and comparing its corresponding reference voltage with variable sensing voltage, the control module amplifies and filters the output signal from the capacitive sensing module after voltage comparison, driving the warning module to emit a warning signal when the distance between the arc-shaped cutting edges of the nail clipper and the flesh below the nail is shorter than the warning distance. </p>

                        <p>        [0001]    The present invention relates to nail clippers, especially to a nail clipping device with warning functions.  </p>

                        <p>        [0002]    During the human growth process, as nails often grow rather fast, there may be safety and hygiene issues associated with skins being scraped by nails and dirt hidden underneath the nails, making it essential to trim nails frequently. However, it is very difficult to trim children or babies&#39; nails with common nail clippers, as they would often wiggle or resist, making it hard to align the nail clipper with the nails. Misuse of nail clippers when trimming a baby&#39;s short and delicate nails may result in accidents involving the flesh being cut, and this unhappy experience may lead the baby to further resist nail trimming thereafter, causing more difficulties and inconveniences for the parents in the future.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    The existing capacitive sensing technology has been developed to become a rather matured technology, which may be applied to thousands of products. Currently, there are a few million accumulated usages of the capacitive sensing technology. The measuring element utilized in capacitive displacement sensing technology is the capacitor between the sensor pads at the conductive material region and their surrounding conductive materials. The formula (I) for calculating the sensor&#39;s capacitance is:  </p>

As the distance between the conductor (such as the finger) and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">sensor  40</span>  changes, the capacitance also changes. As the capacitive effect exists between all kinds of materials, protective measures to insulate noise are usually associated with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">sensor  40</span> , adding two layers of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">package (ground layer  20</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">protectiv<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">e layer  30</span> ) surrounding sensor  40</span>  to prevent interferences from external noise, as shown in  FIG. 1   b . In other words,  FIG. 1   a  illustrates the package structure of a capacitive displacement sensor.  FIG. 1   b  illustrates the corresponding equivalent circuit of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">capacitive displacement sensor  40</span> . As the capacitive effect is utilized, a higher resolution for the capacitive displacement sensor may be achieved. The measuring range for normal capacitive displacement sensors is Â±0.13 mm, with a resolution of 0.1 Î¼m, an accuracy of 0.1-0.2% full scale, and the capacitive displacement sensor undertakes measurement without contact. Based on the above, existing capacitive displacement sensing technology is sufficient for performing micro-distance measurements.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    Therefore, the present invention utilizes the capacitive displacement sensing technology and proposes a nail clipping device with warning functions, preventing accidental cuts to the flesh from happening.  </p>

                        <p>        [0016]    In order to prevent accidental cuts to the flesh from happening, the present invention utilizes the capacitive displacement sensing technology, embeds a capacitive sensing module or a capacitive sensing chip into traditional nail clippers, thereby providing a nail clipping device with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">warning functions  100</span> . The nail clipping device with warning functions is especially convenient for trimming the nails for babies, children, the wounded, patients and the aged. Please refer to  FIG. 1 , it illustrates a nail clipping device according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. During the trimming process, when the cutting edges of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipping device  100</span>  nearly touches the flesh, the warning device on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipping device  100</span> , such as a speaker or a light-emitting diode (LED) indicators will make warning noises or turns the indicators from green to red as a warning signal, preventing accidents cuts from happening. In other words, in addition to the visual observations during nail trimming, the present invention adds the auxiliary function of providing warning signals.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0017]    In one embodiment, based on the principles of capacitive displacement sensing and formula (I) described above, when <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipping device  100</span>  approaches the fingers of the person trimming the nails, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">capacitive sensing module  200</span>  located below the arc-shaped cutting edges of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipping device  100</span>  is able to calculate the distance between a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">capacitive sensing module  200</span>  and the flesh. As shown in  FIG. 3 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">capacitive sensing module  200</span>  is controlled by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">control module  300</span>  located at the lower portion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipping device  100</span> . A warning distance may be pre-set through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">control module  300</span>  (such as pre-setting the value of warning distance to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> be 1</span> mm), and the warning distance is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">saved within capacitive sensing module  200</span> , while simultaneously recording the reference voltage value induced by the corresponding sensor&#39;s capacitance. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">Control module  300</span>  compares each voltage signal measured by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">capacitive sensing module  200</span>  to the reference voltage measured at the warning distance. When the distance between the arc-shaped cutting edges of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipping device  100</span>  and the flesh is shorter than the warning distance, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">control module  300</span>  amplifies and filters the signal outputted by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">capacitive sensing module  100</span>  after voltage comparison has been carried out, driving a pre-set sound effect or indicator display in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">warning module  400</span>  located above the arc-shaped cutting edges of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipping device  100</span> . This changes the color of LED <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">indicators located above warning module  400</span>  (such as turning from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">green light  70</span>  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">red light  80</span> ), or produces warning noises in a speaker (not shown) located on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">warning module  400</span> , acting as a warning signal to prevent accidental cuts from happening. Moreover, if the distance between the arc-shaped cutting edges of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipping device  100</span>  and the flesh is greater than the warning distance (in other words, of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipping device  100</span>  is located outside the warning distance), <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">then control module  300</span>  will turn the LED indicators on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">warning module  400</span>  back to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">green light  70</span> . The aforementioned elements are coupled to each other, and internal power is supplied by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem500">button cell module  500</span>  located on the upper portion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipping device  100</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem500">Button cell module  500</span>  may include: lithium cells, mercury oxide cells, alkaline manganese cells, mercury cells, nickel metal hydride cells, and nickel cadmium cells etc.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0018]    In a preferred embodiment, as shown in  FIG. 4 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">capacitive sensing module  200</span>  in  FIG. 3 . is replaced by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem600">capacitive sensing chip  600</span>  located at the lower portion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipping device  100</span> . For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem600">capacitive sensing chip  600</span>  located below the arc-shaped cutting edges of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipping device  100</span>  may be a single chip micro-controller unit (MCU) or a programmable system on chip (PSoC), and may comprise components such as digital and analog resources, multiplexer, configurable array and memory for interface connections and expansion. The single chip micro-controller unit has an analog to digital converter (ADC) with high signal to noise ratio (SNR) to minimize error, and the programmable system on chip may control the compensation parameters for interferences such as temperature, humidity and electrostatic discharge to improve sensing performance. Based on the principles of capacitive displacement sensing described above, when <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipping device  100</span>  approaches the fingers, other than using the above capacitive sensing calculation formula (I) to calculate the distance between the arc-shaped cutting edges of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipping device  100</span>  and the flesh, a more accurate calculation may be done through the use of a program devel<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem600">opment tool for capacitive sensing chip  600</span> , such as the program development tools (software) for PSoCs (PSoC Designer or PSoC Express) developed by Cypress Semiconductor Corporation. A warning distance may be pre-set through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem700">control module  700</span>  located at the lower portion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipping device  100</span> , and the warning distance is saved within the memory component of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem600">capacitive sensing chip  600</span> , while simultaneously recording the reference voltage value induced by the corresponding sensor&#39;s capacitance. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem700">Control module  700</span>  compares each voltage signal measured by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem600">capacitive sensing chip  600</span>  to the reference voltage measured at the warning distance. When the distance between the arc-shaped cutting edges of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipping device  100</span>  and the flesh is shorter than the warning distance, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem700">control module  700</span>  amplifies and filters the signal outputted by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem600">capacitive sensing module  600</span>  after voltage comparison has been carried out, driving a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem800">warning module  800</span>  located above the arc-shaped cutting edges of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipping device  100</span> , which is responsive to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem600">capacitive sensing chip  600</span>  for issuing warning. This changes the color of LED <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">indicators located above warning module  400</span>  (such as turning from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">green light  70</span>  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">red light  80</span> ), or produces warning noises in a speaker (not shown) located on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem800">warning module  800</span> , acting as a warning signal to prevent accidental cuts from happening. Moreover, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">if nail clipping device  100</span>  is located outside the warning distance, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem700">then control module  700</span>  will turn the LED indicators on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem800">warning module  800</span>  back to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">green light  70</span> . The aforementioned elements are coupled to each other, and internal power is supplied by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem500">button cell module  500</span>  (not shown) located on the upper portion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipping device  100</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem500">Button cell module  500</span>  may include: lithium cells, mercury oxide cells, alkaline manganese cells, mercury cells, nickel metal hydride cells, and nickel cadmium cells etc.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]    Therefore, based on the principles of capacitive displacement sensing, the present invention provides a nail clipper with warning functions to ensure the safety of fingers, making it easier to trim nails and helps to lower the fear and resistance toward nail trimming.  </p>
