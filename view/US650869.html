                        <p>  Be it known that I, JAMES H. REDFE&#39;RN, a   </p>
                    
                        <p>  citizen of the United States, residing at Bay- The device also embodies a pair of tweezers for removing superfluous hair, a scraper for cleaning beneath the nails, and a keeper for holding the handles and jaws closed when not in use.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The implement also embodies means whereby the jaws may be relatively adjusted for maintaining the same in operative relation to each other.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Other objects and advantages of the in vention will appear in the course of the snbjoined description.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The invention consists in a manicure implement embodying certain novel features and details of construction and arrangement of parts, as hereinafter fully described, illustrated in the drawings, and incorporated in the claims.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a perspective view of a manicure implement constructed in accordance with the present invention, showing the handles and jaws open and the scraper folded. Fig. 2 is a side elevation of the same, partly in section, showing the handles held together by the keeper and also showing the means for adjusting and positioning the movable cutting-jaw. Fig. 3 is a side elevation showing the scraper extended in its operative position. Fig. 4 is a crosssection on the line w w of Fig. 2, showing the engagement between the adjustable cuttingjaw and the handle to which it is attached. Fig. 5 is a detail cross-section taken on the line y y of Fig. 2. Fig. 6 is a detailsection on the line 2 z of Fig. 2.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Similar numerals of r<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">eferenc</span>e designate corresponding parts in all the figures of the drawings.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The manicure implement contemplated in this invention comprises a pair of handles 1 minating at their extremities in po<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">inted twee</span>zer-jaws 4, which may be used for<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> removing splinters and</span> superfluous hairs from the skin and also in removing small particles of dead skin. One of the jaws is provided with a curved slot 5, through which the other jaw pa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">sses, and one </span>of the handles isprovided with a cutting-jaw 6, having an arcuate or curved wo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">rking edge 7, </span>which coope<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">rates with the correspondingly-cu</span>rved edge 8 of a second jaw<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> 9, securedto the other handle</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> jaw 9 is pro</span>vided at opposite sides with para<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">llel s</span>tems 10, which are of dovetailed sh<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">ape in cross-secti</span>on and which enter and slide within correspondingly-shaped dovetail grooves 11 in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> the opposite side faces of the handle 2. B</span>y this construction the jaw 9 is c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">apable of</span> movement relatively to th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">e hand</span>le 2, so as to bring its working edge 8 i<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">nto prope</span>r working relation t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">o the edge 7 of</span> the jaw 6. In order to adjust the j<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">aw 9 an</span>d fix t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">he adj</span>ustment, one or more adj<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">usting</span> and fixing screws 12.are employed, which pass thr<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ough and are jour</span>naled or swiveled in the body portion of the jaw 9, said screw or screws having each a thr<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">eaded </span>shank 13, which engages a threaded o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">pening 14 in the h</span>andle 2. By turni<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">ng these screws the </span>jaw 9 m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ay be acc</span>urately adjusted into working<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> relat</span>ion to the jaw 6, and when so adjusted is held fixed by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">means </span>of said screws. By constructing the cutting-jaws with arcuate or curved working edges a curved out is aiforded which in a single operation will trim a fingernail to the desired shape. The jaws are normally held apart by means of a spring 15, the side edges of one end of which<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> are seate</span>d in oppositely-located grooves 16 in the slotted <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">handle 2 at one end of the slo</span>t 5. Th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">e free portion of</span> the spring is cur<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">ved to </span>conform somewhat to the inner contour of the handle 1 and bears at its free end against th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">e inner p</span>ortion of said handle, serving to spread the jaws apart and hold them normally in that condition.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In order to hold the handles together when with a laterally-projecting pointed scraper 21, to b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">e used for removing dirt from beneath th</span>enails. When used for this purpose, the keeper is arranged, as shown in Fig. 3, to extend 1ongitudinally from the end of the handle, to   </p>
                    
                        <p>  which it is pivotally connected by the clamping-screw 18. Said screw is provided wit<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">h a ring or eye 22</span>, forming a handle by which it <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">maybe tightened</span> or loosened and also form- 1 ing means for attaching a chain to the device to prevent its accidental loss when carried upon the person.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  handles 1 and 2, with its extremity pointi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">ng in t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">he direction</span></span> of the pivoted ends of the handles,&#39;as illustrated in Fig. 1, where it will be out of the way and not interfere with the operation of trimming the nails. Each of the handles 1 and 2 is also provided adjacent to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">the twe<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ezer-jaws</span></span> 4 with shear-blades 23, fastened<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> to the handles</span>, as <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">at 24, and havin</span>g rela- I tively-oblique cuttin g edges 25, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">which are actuated by the compression of the</span> handles and which are designed for the removal of surplus or dead flesh or skin from the hands. The shearblades 23 are provided at their inner co<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">rners with over</span>lapping heel extensions 26, forming guard<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">-fingers to prevent injury to t</span>he hands while operating the cuttin g-jaws by preventing portions of the hands and fingers from getting caught between the inner corners of the jaws. These heel extensions 26 also slide in contact with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> each other and pre</span>serve the alinement of the blades 23.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   From the foregoing it will be <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">seen that </span>I have provided a very simple, compact, and efiicient manicure implement which may be safely carried in the pocket and which is ca pable of performing all of the operations necessary for manicuring and treating the hands, and particularly the finger-nails.
