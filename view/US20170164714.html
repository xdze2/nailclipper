                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> This invention enables a physically impaired individual to trim his or her fingernails or toenails with a commercial nail clipper without holding and squeezing the clipper. The device includes a base which holds a small and/or large commercial nail clipper in a removable, reversible sleeve, a hand/foot rest to aid in placing and holding nails between the clipper cutting blades and a lever to be pressed to apply force to the clipper actuating arm and accomplish nail trimming. The primary purpose of the device is to assist individuals in trimming their own fingernails or toenails, especially those who have lost the dexterity in one or both hands or experience pain when squeezing a nail clipper. The invention may also be hand-held by an individual who needs assistance holding and operating a nail clipper. </p>

                        <p>        [0005]    Priority is claimed from Provisional Patent Application No. 62/091,377 filed on Dec. 12, 2014 and incorporated by reference herein.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0006]    The present invention relates to trimming the fingernails and toenails of a human being and may be helpful to an individual who has difficulty gripping and operating commercially available nail clippers. The present invention employs the utility of the common commercial clipper without modification. Such nail clippers are sufficient for use by most people and numerous patents cover methods of modifying the design for easier use although few eliminate the need for the user to hold and squeeze the clipper or to press directly on the actuating arm.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    The common commercial nail clippers are in mass production and typically share a design having two spring steel members joined at one end, having opposing blades on the opposite end, and operated by an actuating arm pivoting on a notched post, closing the blades with an enhanced force when the actuating arm is pressed. The tapered shape, smooth, hard, surfaces, and included angle between the clipper lower member and the actuating arm often cause the actuating arm to swivel out of position or slip from the user&#39;s grip when attempting to trim fingernails or toenails. In addition, squeezing a nail clipper or simply pressing directly on the actuating arm may be painful for some persons.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    This invention provides a nail clipper holding and operating apparatus which enables the user to trim fingernails and toenails by simple downward pressure on a lever which applies force to the actuating arm of the common commercial nail clipper. In the prior art, various devices are marketed to hold a common commercial nail clipper in or on a base to be placed on a flat surface including the Tabletop Nail Clipper, a plastic block with a nail clipper mechanically attached  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    An early U.S. Pat. No. 4,564,034 A, now inactive, disclosed a nail clipper holder which provided a block having cavities to house the commercial nail clippers with the cutting blades protruding and the actuating arm exposed. Although this device and similar devices would provide some assistance with nail trimming, they offer no hand or foot rest to anchor the device and no lever to eliminate the need for the user to press directly on the clipper actuating arm. Patent CN202396750 U is a Nail Clipper For Person With One Hand, presently marketed, which requires relatively good coordination and limits visibility of the clipper blades.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    No known device provides the advantages of the present invention which include providing:  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    1. an apparatus to hold a common commercial nail clipper and trim a fingernail or toenail by pressing a lever rather than pressing directly on the clipper actuating arm;  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    2. an apparatus to hold and operate said commercial nail clipper on a flat surface with the cutting blades at a convenient and comfortable height above the flat surface;  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]    3. a hand or foot rest to anchor the apparatus while the user places and holds a nail between the cutting blades of the clipper for trimming;  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0014]    4. an apparatus which may be hand-held for nail trimming by squeezing the base and lever together;  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0015]    5. an apparatus which be manufactured and marketed specifically for hand-held use by deleting the hand/foot rest;  </p>

                        <p>          [0023]    Numerous persons, because of injury, body configuration, spasticity, ageing, or disease have lost the strength or agility in one or both hands to apply pressure between the thumb and finger(s) in a coordinated pinching motion. Such limitations make it difficult or impossible for an impaired person to use commercially available fingernail clippers, toenail clippers, scissors, or diagonal cutters to trim their own nails. The present device does not require handling fasteners or tools, making the device helpful for impaired persons.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    Many nail trimming devices are small to facilitate transport in a pocket or purse. There is a need for an apparatus for trimming fingernails and toenails that is larger and easier to handle than the commercial clipper. The apparatus must be lightweight and stable enough for an impaired person to use when it is placed on a table or floor and eliminates the need to hold and squeeze the clipper. Other persons may only need a hand-held device which holds the clipper and is operated by squeezing with the fingers and palm.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0025]    The present invention is an ergonomic apparatus which holds a common, commercial fingernail clipper and/or a toenail clipper, enables a handicapped person to position and hold his or her nails between the clipper cutting blades, and trim the nails by pressing a lever rather than directly gripping and squeezing the clipper. For individuals who are able to grip the apparatus, it may be used as a hand-held tool, providing an apparatus which holds the clippers on the base and a lever which, when squeezed, transfers force to the clipper actuating arm, eliminating the need to directly grip and squeeze the clipper.  </p>

                        <p>      DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0032]      FIG. 1-4  show the preferred embodiment of the present invention which hol<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">ds commercially available nail clippers  5</span> ,  6  on a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">base  3</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">hand/foot rest  1</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">hinge bracket  7</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lever  10</span>  that applies force to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">actuating arm  25</span>  of the commercial clipper. The hand/foot rest and the lever are attached to the base with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">molded or pressed living hinges  2</span> ,  9 . The handle  FIG. 5  may be temporarily attached to the lever. The commercial clipper  FIG. 6  is often referred to in this document.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0033]    The present invention has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">flat base  3</span>  to place on a flat surface and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lever  10</span>  which is larger and more stable than the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">clipper actuating arm  26</span>  and has an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">enlarged area  13</span>  on which to press to perform nail trimming action. The lever has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">channel underside  11</span>  to restrain the clipper actuating arm and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">push bar  12</span>  to concentrate the force on the actuating arm.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0034]    The apparatus includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">sleeve  4</span> ,  FIG. 3  which holds a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">small clipper  5</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">large clipper  6</span>  and is comprised of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">base  14</span>  with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">bracket  16</span>  to hold a small clipper, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">bracket  18</span>  to hold a large clipper, and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">stop  17</span>  to limit the depth either clipper may be inserted in the bracket. The sleeve also includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">semispherical depression  15</span>  on both ends of its base to accept the rounded head of the notched post of the commercial clipper and help retain each clipper in the bracket.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0035]    The present invention has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">roughly rectangular hand rest  1</span>  that is attached to the base with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">living hinge  2</span> . With the hand on the hand rest, the base and clipper are less likely to be pushed away while the nail is being placed and held between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">clipper blades  23</span> ,  24 , thus minimizing the need to secure the unit to a surface or brace it against a stationary object. The hand rest may also serve as a foot rest for toenail trimming. The hand rest may have holes to reduce the material requirement and for traction or aesthetic purposes.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0036]    The relatively flat base has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">receiver channel  19</span>  for the reversible sleeve  FIG. 3  and includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">bracket  7</span>  that supports a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">hinge  9</span>  for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lever  10</span>  and helps to keep the lever aligned. The hinge bracket has <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">clips  8</span>  to keep the lever in the operating position and permit lifting the apparatus by the lever.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0037]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">hinge  9</span>  for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">lever  10</span>  may be a molded or pressed plastic living hinge. The lever has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">channel shaped underside  11</span>  to keep the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">commercial clipper actuating arm  26</span>  from swiveling out of alignment while the lever and base enable the pinching action required for cutting nails. The top of the lever may have an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">enlarged area  13</span>  where pressure is applied for nail cutting. The enlarged area of the lever is located directly above the clipper to ensure the apparatus stays in place during the trimming action.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0038]    The present invention may be molded in three parts, the first part consisting of the hand rest, base, and lever, connected by living hinges; the second part being the reversible clipper-holding sleeve, and the third part being the handle  FIG. 5 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0039]    Alternatively, the present invention may be molded as a single part, consisting of the base with a clipper holding sleeve molded integrally, the hand rest, and the lever, connected with living hinges. The manufacturer may choose to omit the handle.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0040]    For trimming toenails, a user may install the handle  FIG. 5  by slipping the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">adapter  20</span>  onto the enlarged end of the lever. The handle assembly will stay attached to the lever and the entire assembly may be lifted and placed on the floor in position for inserting toenails between the clipper blades. The length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">shaft  21</span>  shall be determined by the manufacturer. The handle may be pushed downward with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">knob  22</span>  for toenail trimming. The handle is easily removed when not needed. If the handle is not included with the basic clipper gripper, a user may be able to position his or her toenails between the clipper blades and press the lever with a hand or convenient object.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0041]    A second embodiment of the present invention is hand-held, is supplied without the hand/foot rest and handle, and may have a more compact base.  </p>

                        <p>          [0085]    2. If desired, load a second, passive, clipper in the opposite end of the sleeve with the cutting blades facing outward and its actuating arm folded on top of the bracket on the sleeve. Note that the sleeve is designed to accept many commercially available fingernail clippers and larger toenail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0086]    3. Depress the actuating arm of the active clipper and slide the loaded sleeve into the channel under the lever with the blades of the active clipper facing outward.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0087]    4. For easy positioning of fingers and toes, unfold the hand rest and place the unit on a flat surface. Place and hold nails between the clipper blades. Trim nails by pressing downward on the lever while keeping the device on the stable surface. For storage, fold the hand rest under the unit.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0088]    5. For toenail trimming by the user who is able to bend and reach his or her feet while seated, place the unit on the floor with the ball of the foot on the hand/foot rest. Position the toenail between the clipper cutting blades and press the lever to trim the nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0089]    6. For the user who is not able to reach his or her feet while seated, the user may slip the handle onto the larger end of the lever, being certain that one tab at the end of the handle fits on top of the lever and the other fits under the lever. Use the handle to place the unit on the floor. Using the hand rest as a foot rest, position a toenail between the blades of the clipper; push downward on the handle to trim the toenail. Note that very thick nails should be trimmed in small portions from the edges.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0090]    7. The device may be hand-held by allowing the hand/foot rest to hang freely.  </p>
