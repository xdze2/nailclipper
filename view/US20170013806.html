                        <p>        [0002]    The present disclosure generally relates to grooming and shearing devices for animals, such as pets. More specifically, the present disclosure is related to claw and/or nail shearing devices which can be used to shear, cut and/or trim the nails and/or claws of animals, such as pets.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0003]    Most animals and pets do not enjoy having their nails and/or claws sheared or cut. The nails of animals and pets, such as those of dogs, cats, rabbits, and other mammals contain a hard outer shell and a soft cuticle located toward the center of the nail. The cuticle is often referred to as the “quick” or “kwick” of the pet&#39;s nail (hereinafter “quick”). The cuticle or quick contains a nerve and a blood vessel. Accidentally cutting the quick of the nail can cause excessive bleeding and varying sensations of pain, trauma, and severe discomfort for the animal. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for even the most seasoned pet owner to accidentally or inadvertently cut the quick of the pet&#39;s nail, thereby causing bleeding, pain, and sometimes severe trauma for the pet. Although pet owners can attempt to rely on experienced professionals to cut their pet&#39;s nails, even this approach does not eliminate human error and the possibility of cutting the quick.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0004]    The present invention relates to devices for shearing or cutting the nails and/or claws of animals, and methods for using same. As used herein, it will be appreciated that the term “shearing” can be used interchangeably with the terms “trimming” and “cutting,” particularly with reference to an animal&#39;s nails and/or claws. The terms “shearing,” “cutting” and “trimming” will be understood herein to refer to an act of breaking off or causing to break off a portion of the object being sheared, cut, and/or trimmed (such as the nails and/or claws of an animal).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    As used herein, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill that the terms “claw” and “nail,” in relation to the claws and nails of an animal, such as a pet, can be used interchangeably.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    According to an embodiment of the present invention, a claw shearing device is provided including a first shearing element and a second shearing element. Both the first and the second shearing elements include a cutting edge, a connecting portion, and a handle portion. In both the first and the second shearing elements, the handle portion is distal in relation to the connecting portion, and the cutting edge is proximate in relation to the connecting portion. The claw shearing device also includes a fastener and an adjustable limiting mechanism. The fastener is configured to pivotably attach the connecting portion of the first shearing element to the connecting portion of the second shearing element such that the cutting edge of the first shearing element and the cutting edge of the second shearing element are facing each other. The cutting edges are also configured to form an orifice for the insertion of a claw of a pet or an animal therebetween. The claw shearing device is configured to bring together the first and the second shearing elements to cut the claw of the pet at a predetermined length, where the size of the orifice is limited by the adjustable limiting mechanism.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    According to another embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided of using a device for shearing an animal&#39;s claw. The method includes providing a claw shearing device having a first shearing element, a second shearing element, a fastener, and an adjustable limiting mechanism. The first shearing element and the second shearing element each include a cutting edge and a handle portion. The fastener is configured to pivotably attach the first shearing element to the second shearing element, such that the cutting edges are facing each other. The cutting edges also form an orifice for the insertion of the animal&#39;s claw. The device is configured such that a size of the orifice is limited by the adjustable limiting mechanism. The method also includes determining a maximum diameter of the animal&#39;s claw as measured from a tip of the claw to the beginning of the quick of the animal that is closest to the tip. The limiting mechanism is adjusted such that a maximum diameter of the orifice is less than the above-determined maximum diameter. The animal&#39;s claw is inserted into the orifice of the device, and the animal&#39;s claw is sheared by bringing together the shearing elements of the device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    According to any one of the above embodiments of the present invention, at least one of the first cutting edge and the second cutting edge can be a convex curved cutting edge. According to any one of the above embodiments of the present invention, one of cutting edges can be a convex curved cutting edge, and the second cutting edge can be a substantially flat cutting edge.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    According to any one of the above embodiments, the orifice can be elliptical or round in shape.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    According to any one of the above embodiments, the orifice can be diamond-like in shape.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    According to any one of the above embodiments, the cutting edges are cut at an inclined angle and positioned such that the facing cutting edges create a funnel-like shape tapering in the direction of the claw or nail as the claw or nail is inserted into the orifice of the device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    According to still another embodiment, claw shearing device is provided having a first shearing element comprising a cutting edge having an offset V shape. A second shearing element includes a cutting edge having an offset V shape. The first and second shearing elements are pivotably interconnected to form an orifice for the insertion of a claw of a pet therebetween. The cutting edges engage the claw in at least four points evenly spaced along the circumference of the claw and therefore cleanly shear the claw without twisting or torsion.  </p>

                        <p>        [0025]    Given the following enabling description of the drawings, the devices and methods should become evident to a person of ordinary skill in the art.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        DETAILED DESCRIPTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0026]    According to the devices of the present invention, it is possible to shear, cut or trim an animal or a pet&#39;s claws or nails without cutting the quick. Devices of the present disclosure include shearing elements having cutting edges, which are configured to face each other and create an orifice for the insertion of an animal&#39;s (or pet&#39;s) claw. Devices of the present disclosure also include an adjustable mechanism which makes it capable to adjust the maximum diameter size opening of the orifice such that the portion of the animal&#39;s claw that can be inserted into the orifice does not include any portion of the quick. This substantially reduces, and in some instances eliminates altogether, the possibility of cutting the quick of the animal&#39;s claw while shearing the claw. Methods of using devices of the present invention are also described herein.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]    With reference now to  FIG. 1 , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">claw shearing device  1</span>  is illustrated. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">claw shearing device  1</span>  of  FIG. 1  is shown in a closed position. The claw shearing device includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first shearing element  10</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">second shearing element  11</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first shearing element  10</span>  can include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">cutting edge  12</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">connecting portion  14</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">handle portion  16</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">second shearing element  11</span>  can also include a cutting edge and a connecting portion (not illustrated) and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">handle portion  17</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]    The configuration of the shearing elements is not particularly limited. For example, the shearing elements can be configured to resemble a scissor style claw shearing device. Alternatively, the shearing elements can be configured to resemble a guillotine style claw shearing device, a shear style claw shearing device, and/or a plier style claw shearing device. Moreover, regardless of whether the shearing device of the present invention is configured to resemble a scissor style, a guillotine style, a shear style and/or a plier style shearing device, it will be appreciated that the relative size of the shearing device can be modified to a small, medium, and/or large device (e.g., a small scissor-style shearing device, a medium guillotine-style shearing device, and the like).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0029]    In some embodiments, the handle portion can include a gripping layer (not illustrated) covering or surrounding the handle portion.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0030]    In embodiments, the gripping layer can be made of any resilient, durable and non-toxic rubber or plastic material, such as natural and synthetic rubbers or a blend of synthetic rubbers, nylons, polyesters, and vinyl plastics. In embodiments, illustrative examples of suitable materials that the first and second portions can be made of include, but are not limited to, neoprene plastic, isoprene, styrene-butadiene rubber, butadiene, ethylene-propylene, butyl, chloroprene, nitrile rubber, polyurethane, polycarbonate, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, and mixtures thereof.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0031]    As shown in  FIG. 1 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">handle portion  16</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first shearing element  10</span>  is distal in relation to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">connecting portion  14</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">cutting edge  12</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first shearing element  10</span>  is proximal in relation to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">connecting portion  14</span> . The same can be said for the connecting portion, the cutting edge, and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">handle portion  17</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">second shearing element  11</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0032]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">device  10</span>  can also include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">fastener  20</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">fastener  20</span>  can be configured to pivotably attach the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">connecting portion  14</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first shearing element  10</span>  to the connecting portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">second shearing element  11</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">Suitable fasteners  20</span>  include, but are not limited to, nuts and bolts, screws, and/or rivets. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">fastener  20</span>  is configured to attach the connecting portions of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">second shearing elements  10</span> ,  11  such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">cutting edge  12</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first shearing element  10</span>  and the cutting edge of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">second shearing element  11</span>  are facing each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0033]    In embodiments, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">shearing elements  10</span> ,  11  are configured to form an orifice for the insertion of a claw or a nail of a pet therebetween. For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">device  1</span>  can be configured to bring together the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">shearing elements  10</span> ,  11  to shear or cut the claw or nail of a pet at a predetermined length. During operation, a user can hold the handle portions of the shearing elements to operate the device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0034]    In embodiments, the cutting edge can be replaceable as needed, or be permanently affixed to, or integrally formed with the device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0035]    In some embodiments, at least one of the cutting edges can be a curved edge. In some embodiments, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first cutting edge  12</span>  or the second cutting edge can be a curved edge, and the other cutting edge can be a substantially flat edge surface. In some embodiments, both the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first cutting edge  12</span>  and the second cutting edge can be a convex curved edge, configured such that the cutting edges form a convex, converged orifice during operation of the device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0036]    The shape of the orifice is not particularly limiting. In some embodiments, the shape of the orifice can be elliptical or round-like in shape, such as in a circular shape. In other embodiments, the orifice can be a diamond or other polygonal shape.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0037]    In some embodiments, the cutting edges form an inclined angle and are positioned such that the facing cutting edges create a funnel-like shape tapering in the direction of the claw as the claw of the animal is inserted into the orifice of the device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0038]    In embodiments, the cutting edges are capable of producing a substantially smooth cut claw edge in a single cutting action, with very little to no twisting action or twisting effort required by the user. As such, in embodiments the user is capable of achieving a substantially smooth cut claw edge in a single cutting action simply by an act of bringing the two shearing elements together to close the orifice around the inserted claw.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0039]    Device embodiments of the present disclosure also include an adjustable limiting mechanism. The adjustable limiting mechanism can be connected to the first shearing element and the second shearing element. The adjustable limiting mechanism can be configured such that the maximum diameter and size of the orifice is limited by the adjustable limiting mechanism.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0040]    Suitable adjustable limiting mechanisms include, but are not limited to, a combination of a thumb wheel on a threaded rod. In embodiments, the adjustable limiting mechanism can also include a thumb screw or a nautilus or a cam shaped wheel mounted between the first and the second shearing elements. In other embodiments, the adjustable limiting mechanism can include a telescoping device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0041]    With regard to a telescoping adjustable limiting mechanism, in embodiments, the telescoping adjustable limiting mechanism may have a plurality of through holes or through-openings, of various shapes and sizes and positioned at various locations along the length of the adjustable limiting mechanism. Each through hole represents a different length of adjustment, and therefore corresponds to a different size opening for the orifice of the device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0042]    Generally, the diameter of the claw of an animal increases from the tip of the claw, as one approaches the beginning of the quick that is closest to the tip, and continuing in a direction toward the animal. The diameter of the claw of an animal is smallest when measured at the tip of the claw, at a point furthest away from the animal itself.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0043]    During use, the maximum diameter of an animal&#39;s claw along the length of the claw beginning at the tip of the animal&#39;s claw (furthest from the animal itself) to an endpoint of the quick of the animal&#39;s claw that is located closest to the tip of the claw is determined. Then, the adjustable limiting mechanism is engaged to set the maximum diameter and size of the orifice to be less than the above-determined maximum diameter. During use, the animal&#39;s claw is inserted into the orifice of the device. Because the maximum diameter and size of the orifice has been set to be less than the maximum diameter of the animal&#39;s claw that is measured from the length of the claw between the tip of the claw to the quick of the animal&#39;s claw that is closest to the claw tip, shearing or cutting the animal&#39;s claw by use of the device will not cut the quick of the animal.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0044]    Referring back to  FIG. 1 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">device  1</span>  of the present disclosure can also include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">shaft  40</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">shaft  40</span>  can be configured to extend between, and be releasably connected to, at least one of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first shearing element  10</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">second shearing element  11</span> , such that the cutting edges of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">shearing elements  10</span> ,  11  are facing each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0045]    In embodiments, one or both opposite ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">shaft  40</span>  may be threaded. One or both of the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">second shearing elements  10</span> ,  11  can also contain a threaded opening such that one or both of the first and second shearing elements are releasably connectable to one or both ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">shaft  40</span> . The threaded opening extends at least partially through the total thickness of the first and/or second shearing element. The threaded opening may also extend through the entire thickness of the first and/or second shearing element.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0046]    For example, in some embodiments, at least one of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first shearing element  10</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">second shearing element  11</span>  can include a threaded center opening, such that the at least one threaded center opening is capable of releasably engaging with a threaded portion of the shaft.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0047]    In embodiments, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">shaft  40</span>  may also contain a shoulder. In embodiments, the shaft screw thread advances until the shoulder butts against a bottom surface of the threaded portion of the shearing element. Alternatively, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">shaft  40</span>  may create a threaded or unthreaded friction fit with a threaded or unthreaded hole in the shearing element, which preferably permits adjustment and retention of an exposed length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">shaft  40</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0048]    With reference to  FIG. 2 , a close-up illustration of the cutting edge portions of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">shearing device  100</span>  in a partially open position is provided. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">device  100</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">fastener  120</span>  that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">interconnects shearing elements  110</span>  and  111 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0049]    Portions of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">first shearing element  110</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">second shearing element  111</span>  are shown in  FIG. 2 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">cutting edge  112</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">first shearing element  110</span>  and the cutting edge of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">second shearing element  111</span>  are partially spread apart from one another to form an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">orifice  150</span> . The shearing elements are opened in the direction of arrow A. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">orifice  150</span>  in  FIG. 2  is in the shape of a diamond, though any of the shapes, as described above, would also be suitable (e.g., elliptical, round, polygonal, etc.).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0050]    The maximum diameter or opening size of the orifice is limited, as described above, by an adjustable limiting mechanism or a shaft, and the like. Therefore, the maximum amount of direction that the shearing elements can be moved in the direction shown by arrow A is limited by the adjustment of the limiting mechanism. This is so that the maximum diameter or opening size of the orifice can be smaller than the maximum diameter of the claw of the animal as measured from the tip of the claw to the beginning of the quick closest to the tip of the claw.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0051]    During use, the claw or nail of an animal is inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">orifice  150</span> . The maximum diameter or size of the orifice is limited, as described above, by an adjustable limiting mechanism or a shaft, and the like.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0052]    Once the claw of the animal is inserted, the shearing elements of the device are moved in the direction of arrow B to perform a cutting or a shearing action. The cutting edges of the shearing elements shear, cut, or pass through the claw of the animal, thereby shearing the claw at the desired length.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0053]      FIGS. 3-4  illustrate an embodiment of the adjustable claw shearing device of the invention. As illustrated, the adjustable limiting mechanism of this <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem240">embodiment comprises shaft  240</span>  which freely passes through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem245">guide  245</span>  and is fixedly attached to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem247">stop  247</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem245">Guide  245</span>  may be pivotally attached to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem230">shearing element  230</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem247">stop  247</span>  may be pivotally attached to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem232">shearing element  232</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">Spring <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem240"> 250</span>  surrounds shaft  240</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem252">abuts collar  252</span>  at one end and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem247">abuts stop  247</span>  at a second end. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem252">Collar <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem240"> 252</span>  surrounds shaft  240</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">abuts spring  250</span>  at one end and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem245">abuts guide  245</span>  at the other end. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem240">Shaft  240</span>  is threaded and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem254">adjustment knob  254</span>  is coupled to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem240">shaft  240</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">Spring  250</span>  is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem245">biased towards block  245</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem247">stop  247</span>  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem256">urge handles  256</span>  and  258  away from each other thus opening the cutting blades. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem240">Shaft  240</span>  is threaded and provided with an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem254">adjustment knob  254</spa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem240">n>  which may be positioned along shaft  240</span>  to control the maximum diameter or size of the orifice.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0054]      FIGS. 5 to 8  illustrate another embodiment of the adjustable claw shearing device of the invention in its closed, partially open and fully open state. In this embodiment the claw shearing device includes, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">first shearing element  310</span> , first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">second blades  320</span>  and  330  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem340">second shearing element  340</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">First shearing element  310</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem312">handle  312</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem314">connection portion  314</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem340">Second shearing element  340</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem342">handle  342</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem344">connection portion  344</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem360">fastener  360</span>  is provided to pivotally interconnect first and second shearing elements and first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">second blades  320</span>  and  330  such that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">first blade  320</span>  moves with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">first shearing element  310</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem330">second blade  330</span>  moves with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem340">second shearing element  340</span> . Suitable fasteners include but are not limited to nuts, bolts, screws and/or rivets. In this embodiment, first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">second blades  320</span>  and  330  may be removed and replaced at the user&#39;s discretion. Alternatively, first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">second blades  320</span>  and  330  may be integrally formed with first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">second shearing elements  310</span>  and  340 , respectively.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0055]    To control the maximum diameter or the size of the opening between first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">second blades  320</span>  and  330 , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem365">shaft  365</span>  is passed through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">first shearing element  310</span>  and fixedly attached to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem340">second shearing element  340</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem370">Spring  370</span>  surrounds a portion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem365">shaft  365</span>  and is disposed between and abuts first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">second shearing elements  310</span>  and  340 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem370">Spring  370</span>  is biased to urge first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">second shearing elements  310</span>  and  340  away from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">each other thereby urging blades  320</span>  and  330  away from each other and creating an orifice between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">blades  320</span>  and  330 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem365">Shaft  365</span>  is provided with an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem367">adjustment knob  367</span>  which is engaged with the threaded portion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem365">shaft  365</span> . As <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem367">adjustment knob  367</span>  is moved toward the end of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem365">shaft  365</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem370">spring <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310"> 370</span>  urges shearing elements  310</span>  and  340  farther away from each other thereby enlarging the orifice between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">blades  320</span>  and  330 . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem369">jam nut  369</span>  is provided to lock the size of the orifice. This feature is particularly useful when a user has determined the optimal orifice size for his or her pet thereby allowing the user to reuse the device without having to recalibrate. Alternatively, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem367">adjustment knob  367</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem369">jam nut  369</span>  may be replaced by a thumb adjusting screw (not shown) such as that found in a conventional adjustable wrench. The thumb adjusting screw may be embedded in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">shearing element  310</span>  and coupled to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem367">shaft  367</span>  to facilitate quick and easy adjustment.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0056]    In still another embodiment of the invention illustrated in  FIG. 9 , the adjustable limiting mechanism may comprise a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem410">spring  410</span>  fixedly attached to first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem420">second shearing elements  420</span>  and  430 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem420">First shearing element  420</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem422">blade assembly  422</span>  having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem424">stop  424</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem426">handle  426</span>  extending from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem420">blade assembly  420</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem430">Second shearing element  430</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem432">blade assembly  432</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem434">handle  434</span>  extending from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem432">blade assembly  432</span> . To set and hold a maximum opening of blade assemblies, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem436">cam  436</span>  having a plurality of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem438">catches  438</span>  is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem426">rotatably mounted within handle  426</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem436">Cam  436</span>  may be rotated to allow different ones of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem438">catches  438</span>  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem424">engage stop  424</span> . Each position in which a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem438">catch  <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem424">438</span>  engages stop  424</span>  represents a different maximum opening of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem420">blade assemblies  420</span>  and  430 . Alternatively, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem436">cam  436</span>  could be replaced by a thumb adjusting screw (not shown) such as that found in a conventional adjustable wrench. The thumb adjusting screw may be embedded in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem426">handle  426</span>  and coupled to a shaft passing through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem410">spring  410</span>  to facilitate quick and easy adjustment.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0057]    Also provided are methods for cutting or trimming the nails and/or claws of a pet utilizing nail cutting devices of the present disclosure. The maximum diameter of an animal&#39;s claw measured along the length of the claw from the tip of the animal&#39;s claw (furthest from the animal itself) to the end of the quick of the animal&#39;s claw that is closest to the tip is determined.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0058]    Then, the adjustable limiting mechanism is engaged to set the maximum diameter and size of the orifice to be less than the above-determined maximum diameter. During use, the animal&#39;s claw is inserted into the orifice of the device. Because the maximum diameter and size of the orifice has been set to be less than the maximum diameter of the animal&#39;s claw that is measured from the length of the claw between the tip of the claw to the quick of the animal&#39;s claw that is closest to the claw tip, shearing or cutting the animal&#39;s claw by use of the device will not cut the quick of the animal. The maximum diameter can be adjusted using the limiting mechanism or shaft of the nail cutting device, as described above.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0059]    By allowing only a portion of the pet&#39;s nail to enter the orifice that is less than the maximum diameter of the claw as measured from the tip of the claw to the beginning of the quick that is closest to the tip, this prevents the user of the nail cutting device from cutting the quick of the pet during use. The likelihood of the pet&#39;s quick getting cut while trimming or cutting the pet&#39;s nails is greatly decreased, thereby preventing injury, pain, trauma and/or bleeding. In certain instances, by using devices of the present disclosure, the likelihood of the pet&#39;s quick getting cut while trimming or cutting the pet&#39;s nails is effectively eliminated.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0060]    In keeping with the invention, various blade assemblies may be employed. However, in accordance with an aspect of the invention, a specific blade assembly was developed that is useable with all animal nail clippers, regardless of style or other functional attributes. As illustrated in  FIG. 10  the blade assembly of the invention includes first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem510">second blades  510</span>  and  540  that are pivotally coupled to each other at <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem550">pivot point  550</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem510">first blade  510</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem512">cutting edge  512</span>  in the shape of an offset V and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem540">second blade  540</span>  includes a substantially identical shaped cutting edge. In some embodiments first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem510">second blades  510</span>  and  515  are interconnected in back to back fashion such that the vertices of the respective cutting edges oppose each other and an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem542">orifice or opening  542</span>  is formed between first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem510">second blades  510</span>  and  540 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0061]      FIG. 11  shows a single blade having a shearing arc R. The shearing arc is the arc of the path that is traversed by the blade as the blade is opened and closed. As illustrated, shearing arc R bisects the vertex of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem512">cutting edge  512</span>  and extends to the mouth of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem512">cutting edge  512</span> . In accordance with a feature of the invention, at every point along the shearing arc R, the distance between the first leg of the offset V and the shearing arc, the forward shearing gap (FSG), is substantially equal to the distance between the second leg of the offset V and the shearing arc, the aft shearing gap (ASG). Accordingly, when an animal&#39;s claw is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem542">inserted into orifice  542</span>  and the blade assembly is closed, the cutting edges engage the claw in at <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">least four (4</span>) points evenly spaced along the circumference of the claw thereby shearing the claw cleanly with a minimal amount of twist or torsion.  </p>
