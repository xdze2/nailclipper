                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A nail clipper for pets has a first semi-spherical or semi-elliptical part which is hollowed-out with a circular or elliptical hole with a blade formed on a rim of the hole, and a second semi-spherical or elliptical part having a shape matching the outside of the first part and a blade formed on a rim thereof. By placing the pet&#39;s nail in the hollowed-out hole of the first semi-spherical or elliptical part and rotating the second part along the outside of the first part, the blades of the first and second parts come together to cut the pet&#39;s nail, producing smooth nail edges cut in a semi-circular shape in a single cutting action. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> TECHNICAL FIELD  </p>
                    
                        <p>    This invention generally relates to a nail clipper for pets, and particularly, to one having a semi-spherical or semi-elliptical shape.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    BACKGROUND OF INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The conventional nail clipper for pets, such as dogs and cats, typically has a straight or slightly curved cutting edge. This presents a problem in that the nail when cut may have a sharp edge.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    SUMMARY OF INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    In accordance with the present invention, a nail clipper for pets has the following distinctive features. The nail clipper has a first part formed in a semi-spherical or semi-elliptical shape. It is made of a hard material such as metal, and can be fabricated by splitting a spherical or elliptical part and hollowing its interior. The hollowed-out semi-spherical or elliptical part has a circular or elliptical hole, and has a blade formed on a rim of the hole. The first semi-spherical or elliptical part is formed with two holes (on opposite sides) where a pin is inserted and bears on the part therein. A second semi-spherical or elliptical part is also formed with a matching spherical or elliptical shape and made of a hard material such as metal. It is also made by hollowing the interior of a portion of a spherical or elliptical part, and is formed with a blade on its rim. The blade may be formed (in cross-section) as a straight line, a curved line, or a ‚ÄúV‚Äù shape. The second part is formed with two holes (on opposite sides) and held pivotably to the first semi-spherical or elliptical part by the pin as its axis of rotation. By placing the pet&#39;s nail in the hollowed-out hole of the first semi-spherical or elliptical part and rotating the second part along the outside of the first part, the blades of the first and second parts come together to cut the pet&#39;s nail. The invention produces smooth nail edges cut in a semi-circular shape in a single cutting action.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will be explained in the following detailed description of the invention having reference to the appended drawings.  </p>

                        <p>  </p>
                    
                        <p>    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Referring to  FIGS. 1A‚Äì1C , a nail clipper for pets has a first part A formed in a semi-spherical or semi-elliptical shape. It is made of a hard material such as metal, and can be fabricated by splitting a spherical or elliptical part and hollowing its interior. The hollowed-out semi-spherical or elliptical part has a circular or elliptical hole D, and has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> blade D 1</span>  formed on a rim of the hole D. The first semi-spherical or elliptical part A is formed with two holes on opposite diametrical sides where a pin C is inserted and bears on the part therein.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    A second semi-spherical or elliptical part B is also formed with a spherical or elliptical shape matching the outside of the first part and is made of a hard material such as metal. It is also made by hollowing the interior of a split-off portion of a spherical or elliptical part, and is formed with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> blade D 2</span>  on its rim. The blade may be formed (in cross-section) as a straight line, a curved line, or a ‚ÄúV‚Äù shape. The second part is also formed with two holes on opposite diametrical sides and held pivotably to the first semi-spherical or elliptical part by the pin C on each side as its axis of rotation. When the pet&#39;s nail is placed in the hollowed-out hole D of the first semi-spherical or elliptical part A, the second part B can be rotated to bring its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> blade D 2</span>  over the outside of the first part and over its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> blade D 1</span> , so that they come together to cut the pet&#39;s nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The range of dimensions of the parts of the nail clipper may be as follows. For a semi-spherical device shape, a first semi-spherical part A can have a wall thickness in the range of about 0.1 mm to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> about 12</span>.0 mm, an interior diameter of 2.0 mm to 80.0 mm, and an exterior diameter of 2.2 mm to 104.0 mm. The semi-spherical part A can have a circular hole of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> from 1</span>.5 mm to 70.0 mm diameter, or an elliptical hole with major diameter of 1.5 mm to 70.0 mm and minor diameter of 1.0 mm to 65.0 mm. The second semi-spherical part B can also have a wall thickness in the range of about 0.1 mm to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> about 12</span>.0 mm, and other dimensions matching the outside of the first part A and the functions as described previously.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    For a semi-elliptical device shape, a first semi-elliptical part A can have a wall thickness in the range of about 0.1 mm to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> about 12</span>.0 mm, an interior major diameter of 2.5 mm to 90.0 mm and minor diameter of 2.0 mm to 80.0 mm. The semi-elliptical part A can have an elliptical hole with a major diameter of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> from 1</span>.5 mm to 75.0 mm and a minor diameter of 1.0 mm to 65.0 mm. The second semi-elliptical part B can also have a wall thickness in the range of about 0.1 mm to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> about 12</span>.0 mm, and other dimensions matching the outside of the first part A and the functions as described previously.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The preferred dimensions of the parts of the nail clipper may be as follows. For a semi-spherical device shape, a first semi-spherical part A can have a wall thickness of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> about 1</span>.0 mm, an interior diameter of 8.0 mm and an exterior diameter of 10.0 mm. The semi-spherical part A can have a circular hole of 6.0 mm diameter. The second semi-spherical part B can also have a wall thickness of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> about 1</span>.0 mm and other dimensions matching the outside of the first part A and the functions as described previously.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    For a preferred semi-elliptical device shape, a first semi-elliptical part A can be made of carbon steel material and have a wall thickness of 2.0 mm, an interior major diameter of 10.0 mm and minor diameter of 8.0 mm. The semi-elliptical part A can have an elliptical hole with major/minor diameters of 7.0 mm and 5.5 mm. The second semi-elliptical part B can also have a wall thickness of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> about 2</span>.0 mm, and other dimensions matching the outside of the first part A and the functions as described previously.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Referring to  FIG. 2 , the first part A and second part B are shown assembled in the nail clipper device, held together rotatably by the pins C. A cog E is attached on the surface of the semi-spherical or elliptical part B where the pin C is placed. The pin C and the cog E use the same shaft. The cog E is engaged with a large fan-shaped cog F having a radius four to eight times greater than the radius of cog E (for multiplied leverage). An operating lever H is coupled to the fan-shaped cog F to rotate it. The pin J is at the pivot center of the fan-shaped cog F. The pin J and the pin C are journaled in the operating lever G and stabilize the operating lever G on the semi-spherical or elliptical part A. A spring K is placed between the movable parts of the operating lever G and the operating lever H. Pivoting the operating lever G and the operating lever H together rotates the semi-spherical or elliptical part B around the semi-spherical or elliptical part A to cut the pet&#39;s nail placed in the hole in the part A. The cutting movement produces smooth nail edges cut in a semi-circular shape in a single cutting action.  </p>
