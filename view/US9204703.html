                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A rear-pivot-point lever, cam-enabled, captured-spring-biased nail trimmer is disclosed. A base plate with a front cutting edge is pivotally connected to a top plate with a front cutting edge at a central base pivot point. A spring is captured between the plates in a manner that biases the front cutting edges of the trimmer apart until the trimmer is actuated. The top plate has a rear end for receiving and pivotally cooperating with a cammed actuating lever, the front end of which is pushed downward/forward to act against the bias of the spring to close the cutting edges to cut a nail. Because the lever arm pivots at a pivot point or axle at or near the rear end of the trimmer, the thumb and finger(s) of the user are positioned at or near the front of the trimmer during use, and therefore, near the nail being trimmed. This results in stable and non-twisting operation. The lever may be swung around the plates of the trimmer to rest below the bottom plate in a compact configuration. </p>

                        <p>      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This invention relates generally to nail trimmers. More specifically, this invention relates to an off-set lever, cam-enabled, captured-spring-biased nail trimmer.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Related Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>      There are many nail trimmer designs in the prior art. Still, there is an absence of fresh nail trimmer designs that may excite the visual and mechanical interests of modern buyers. This invention addresses this need.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention is an rear-pivot-point lever, cam-enabled, captured-spring-biased nail trimmer. The trimmer comprises a base plate with a front cutting end, a central base pivot point for receiving a top plate also having a front cutting end, and a spring for biasing the base plate and top plate into an open, non-cutting position. The top plate also has a central top pivot point for cooperating with the central base pivot point of the base plate, preferably with an axle connecting the base and top plates at said central base pivot points. In addition, the top plate also has a rear end for receiving and pivotally cooperating with a cammed actuating lever. The lower cammed surface of the actuating lever also cooperates with a top surface of the base plate so that, when the actuating lever is pressed downward and forward, for example by pivoting the lever toward the top plate, the front end of the top plate is urged downward onto the front end of the base plate to perform the nail trimming operation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In the preferred embodiment, the base plateâ€”has a longitudinal spring secured to near its rear end. The spring curves from near the back end of the base plate to almost near its front end. There, the curved spring passes over a pivot axle connecting the base plate and the top plate at their central pivot point, and rests under the bottom surface of the top plate near its front end. The bias of the spring biases the front ends of the trimmer open, because the spring is biased to straighten and pulls the back end of the base plate upward relative to the rear end of the top plate. This bias may be overcome by the pressure of the actuating lever when it is actuated to close the trimmer front ends. Alternatively, the nail trimmer may use other types and styles of spring(s), for example, a flat leaf spring positioned similarly to the springs in the drawings of this document, or a coil spring at or near the back ends of the plates for urging the back ends together to separate the front cutting edges of the plates.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The actuating lever may be located in various locations relative to the plates with cutting edges. For example, the actuating lever may be offset to be on or near the right side or the left side, or, may be located centrally along the longitudinal center plane of the trimmer.  </p>

This way, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">spring  34</span>  urges the rear ends of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">base plate  12</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">top plate  14</span>  together, and urges the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">base plate  12</span>  and top plate apart at their <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">front cutting edges  18</span>  and  20 , respectively. One may note that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">spring  34</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">clamp  36</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">trimmer  100</span>  are preferably offset to one side of the trimmer, as shown to best advantage in  FIGS. 8 ,  9 , and  15 . Alternatively, clamp structure for capturing/holding the spring may be integral with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">base plate  12</span> , rather than being screwed to the base plate. For example, there may be an opening in the base plate and/or an opening in a protrusion upending from the base plate that will capture a rear end of the spring. The longitudinal spring may have a hook or other non-linear structure, for example, to hook into and/or otherwise be retained in said clamp structure. The spring may also have curvature and/or bends to better extend through the trimmer body to near the front end of the trimmer. Therefore, the longitudinal spring need not be perfectly straight or linear, but may have some curvature and/or bends even when removed from the nail trimmer and consequently not under any external force. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> </p>
                    
                        <p>      While trimmer  10</span>  comprises a lever that is located generally on the right side of the trimmer, and on the right side of the top plate, it will be understood that the lever may be positioned on the left of the trimmer and the top plate. The trimmer may be a mirror image of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">trimmer  10</span>  shown in  FIGS. 1-15 , or of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">trimmer  100</span>  shown in  FIGS. 16-18 . In other words, the lever is located to one side or the other of a longitudinal center plane, wherein said center plane extends into the paper of  FIG. 3  midway between the sides of the trimmer.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Most of the components of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail trimmer  10</span>  discussed above are also visible in  FIG. 2 , which is a left side view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail trimmer  10</span>  shown in the right side view of  FIG. 1 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>        FIGS. 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 , and  7  depict different views of the embodiment depicted in  FIGS. 1 and 2 . Specifically,  FIG. 3  is a top view,  FIG. 4  is a bottom view,  FIG. 5  is a front view, and  FIG. 6  is a back view of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail trimmer  10</span> .

In this figure, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">actuating lever tip  30</span>  has been pushed down, which, because of the pivotal connection of the lever to the trimmer, amounts to pivoting of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">tip  30</span>  forward and downward. This <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">motion raises lever back  32</span>  up, and raising the back end of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">top plate  14</span> . Because of the pivotal connection of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">top plate  14</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">base plate  12</span> , this <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">motion causes front cutting edge  20</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">top plate  14</span>  to b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">e urged down towards front cutting edge  18</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">base plate  12</span> , enabling the nail trimming operation.  </p>

                        <p>        FIG. 13  is a top view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail trimmer  10</span> , in its storage configuration as in  FIGS. 10-12 .  FIG. 13  has <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">an off-center longitudinal section line  14</span> - 14 , along which the cross-section of  FIG. 14  is viewed. In  FIG. 14 , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">screw  <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">44</span>  for securing clamp  36</span>  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">base plate  12</span>  is visible. This <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">screw  44</span>  is also visible in  FIG. 4 . Alternatively, as discussed earlier in this document, an integral clamp or other receiving structure or aperture may be provided on or in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">base plate  12</span>  to capture the rear end of the spring, including a hooked, curved, or looped end of the spring. Alternatively, other springs may be used, for example, a flat leaf spring positioned similarly to the springs shown in the drawings, or a coil spring pulling the back ends of the base plate and top plate together. For such alternative spring embodiments, clamps or retainers other than those shown may be used to capture the coil spring.  </p>

                        <p>      The present invention may be manufactured from conventional materials by conventional methods. Metals that may be cast or otherwise formed to have sharp cutting edges are preferred. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">front cutting edges  18</span>  and  20  may be of conventional design. Preferably, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">longitudinal spring  34</span>  may be made of spring steel, and, while it is shown as having a rectangular-cross-section, other spring shapes may be used, such as circular-cross-section longitudinal springs, or other springs such as a flat leaf spring or a coil spring.  </p>

                        <p>        FIGS. 19-33  illustrate an alternative embodiment of the invented nail trimmer that has a lever that is located and pivots in a more central location relative to the base plate and top plate, rather than a lever that is off to one side or the other of the top plate.  FIG. 19  is a right side view of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">trimmer  200</span> , similar to the right side view of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">trimmer  10</span>  in  FIG. 1 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">Trimmer  200</span>  has <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">base plate  212</span>  connected to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">top plate  214</span>  by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem216">plate pivot axle  216</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">Base plate  212</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">top plate  214</span>  have <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem218">front cutting edges  218</span>  and  220 , respectively.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Near the back end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">top plate  214</span>  is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem222">lever pivot axle  222<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem224"></span>  which connects actuating lever  224</span>  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">top plate  214</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">Lever  24</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem226">cammed surface  226</span>  which contacts and cooperates with top surface of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">base plate  212</span>  when <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem230">lever tip  230</span>  is pushed/pivoted down and forward to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem232">lift lever back  232</span>  up and urge the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem220">front cutting edge  220</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">top plate  214</span>  down toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem218">front cutting edge  218</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">base plate  212</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem234">Longitudinal spring  234</span>  is secured to near the back end of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">base plate  212</span>  with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem236">clamp  236</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem234">Spring  234</span>  extends from near the back end of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">base plate  212</span> , passes over <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem216">plate pivot axle  216</span> , and rests under the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem238">bottom surface  238</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">top plate  214</span>  near its front. This way, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem234">spring  234</span>  urges the rear ends of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">base plate  212</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">top plate  214</span>  together, and urges the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">base plate  212</span>  and top plate apart at their <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem218">front cutting edges  218</span>  and  220 , respectively. Note that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem234">spring  234</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem236">clamp  236</span>  are located to one side of the central longitudinal axis of the trimmer, so as to be offset to one side of and not interfering with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem224">lever  224</span> . This may be seen to best advantage in  FIGS. 26 ,  27  and  33 . Alternatively, as disclosed earlier in this document, an integral clamp or other receiving structure or aperture may be provided on or in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">base plate  12</span>  to capture the rear end of the spring, including to capture a hooked, curved, or looped end of the spring. Alternatively, other springs may be used, for example, a flat leaf spring positioned similarly to the springs shown herein, or a coil spring pulling the back ends of the base plate and top plate together. In such alternative embodiments, clamps or retainers others than those shown may be used to capture the coil spring.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The major difference between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">trimmer  200</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">trimmers  10</span>  and  100  is the location of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem224">lever  224</span>  relative to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">base plate  212</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">top plate  214</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem224">Lever  224</span>  is located and pivotally connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">top plate  214</span>  in a central location, which is between a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem251">right arm  251</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem252">left arm  252</span>  of the back end of the top plate. The right and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem251">left arms  251</span> ,  252  are parallel extensions that extend parallel to the longitudinal axis of the trimmer. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem255">Central space  255</span>  is between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem251">arms  251</span> ,  252  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem224">receives lever  224</span>  and provides space for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem224">lever  224</span>  to pivot down and forward toward the front end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">top plate  214</span> . This lever location and operation is best illustrated in  FIG. 25  (open configuration) and  FIG. 26  (closed, cutting configuration). This <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">trimmer  200</span>  is easily held and used, with force exerted on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem224">lever  224</span>  being applied in a plane generally extending through the central, longitudinal axis of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">trimmer  200</span> , rather than to one or the other side of the longitudinal axis of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">trimmer  200</span> . The central location of the lever may prevent twisting of the trimmer during use, as the force will be applied nearly straight down along the central longitudinal plane. With finger(s) against the bottom surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">base plate  212</span>  and a thumb or finger against the top surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem230">lever tip  230</span> , the finger(s) and thumb are close to the nail being trimmed and are holding and forcing the trimmer parts in a balanced, stable, non-twisting manner. This <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">trimmer  200</span>  may also appeal equally to both right- and left-handed users. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200"> </p>

FIG. 31  has <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">an off-center longitudinal section line  32</span> - 32 , along which the cross-section of  FIG. 32  is viewed. In  FIG. 32 , the screw that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem236">secures spring clamp  236</span>  is visible. Other springs and/or spring-capture structure may be used to bias the front cutting edges apart until force is applied by a user to cut a nail; one of skill in the art will understand how to adapt the trimmer for said springs/capture structure after viewing and reading this document.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        FIG. 33  is an exploded, perspective view of the embodiment depicted in  FIGS. 19-32 , wherein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem224">lever  224</span>  is in an in-use orientation rather than the storage orientation. While the pieces of the trimmer shown in  FIG. 33  are not called-out with reference numbers, one may understand the pieces and their functions by referring to the description above and also to the description and call-out numbers for similar pieces in the portrayal of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">trimmer  10</span>  in  FIG. 15 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In use, the nail trimmers according to the invention tend to be more stable and accurate that convention nail trimmers. One may see in  FIGS. 8 and 26  the typical use of the nail trimmers. Because the lever tip, when actuated, is at or near the front end of the trimmer, the user may position both thumb T and finger F at or near the front end of the trimmer. The trimmer is therefore held, and force is applied, between the thumb T and finger F near the cutting edges of the trimmer and near the nail N being cut, which results in stable and accurate performance. With a conventional trimmer, the thumb and finger(s) of the user are at or near the back end of the trimmer, for example, 1.5-3 inches away from the cutting edges. Consequently, with a conventional trimmer, the force of the thumb and finger required to close the cutting edges also frequently twists or turns the trimmer while the user is trying to trim the nail, and sometimes the trimmer even twists or flips away from the nail to be cut, and/or out of the hand of the user. Instead, in use of the invented trimmer, the thumb T and finger F, and the lever tip and the portion of bottom surface of the bottom plate that is contacted by the finger, are very close to the cutting edges, for example, 0-1 inch away. Therefore, with the invented trimmer, twists, turns, and flipping of the trimmer relative to the nail N are very unlikely to happen. One may note that the thumb and index finger are usually used to actuate the preferred nail trimmer, but other fingers may be used, especially because the stability of the trimmer makes the trimmer easier to use by older people and people with hand pain or problems.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The cammed lever of the preferred trimmers may contribute to smooth and efficient operation of the trimmer. One may see the operation cammed lever surfaces and operation of the cammed lever surfaces by comparing  FIGS. 7 and 8 , and  FIGS. 17 and 18 , for example. The cammed surfaces preferably comprise a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">protruding cam  23</span>  that slides from a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">rear cam surface  25</span>  to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">bottom cam surface  26</span>  during actuation of the trimmer (see call-out numbers in  FIG. 1 ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In many embodiments, the nail trimmer may be described as comprising: a bottom plate and a top plate pivotally connected at a central pivot point between the front end and rear ends of said plates, wherein the front end of each plate comprises a cutting edge; a spring captured between the top plate and bottom plate and biasing the front ends of the plates apart to an open position; a lever having a rear lever end pivotally connected to said top plate at a rear pivot point at or near the rear end of the top plate and the lever extending forward above said top plate, wherein the lever has a front tip for being pushed down toward the front end of the top plate, and wherein the lever has a cam protrusion near the rear lever end that slides along a top surface of the bottom plate to force the rear end of the bottom plate and the rear end of the top plate apart so that the cutting edges are moved together to cut a fingernail. The nail trimmer may comprise a longitudinal spring extending from near the front end of the plates to near the rear end of the plates. The longitudinal spring may be anchored to the top surface of the bottom plate near the rear end of the bottom plate, and extend forward above an axle of the central pivot point to abut at its front end up against the bottom surface of the top plate near the front end of the top plate. The central pivot point is preferably located at a position that is in a range of â…™-â…“ of the distance from the front cutting edges to the rear pivot point. The rear pivot point is preferably rearward from the rear end of the bottom plate. The lever may be offset to a right side of said top plate, or offset to a left side of the top plate, or centrally located so that it is parallel to a central longitudinal axis of the nail trimmer. Said top plate may have a central space between right and left sides of the top plate so that the lever is pivotally connected to said to plate, and pivots in, said central space.  </p>
