                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> An apparatus for cutting nails includes a plastic frame with a pair of opposing parallel cutting blades. A first of the pair of blades is attached to an upper half of the frame and a second of the pair of blades is attached to a lower half of the frame. The blades are formed of a material that is different than the frame. A center rod extends through the frame and the cutting blades. The center rod is used to create and transfer a force necessary to sever a fingernail or toenail and to secure a position of the blades with respect to each other. A pivoting lever is used to supply the force to a surface of the blades sufficient to urge the cutting blades toward each other to simultaneously sever the nail. The majority of the forces produced during use are applied directly to the cutting blades. </p>

                        <p>      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention, in general, relates to personal grooming devices and, more particularly, to toe and finger nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Nail clippers, the term as used herein including either toe or finger nail type of clippers, are generally well known.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Certain prior art types of nail clippers do not fold sufficiently flat for storage. Others do not apply leverage that can create sufficient force to cut through difficult nails without requiring a great deal of force by a user.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Prior art nail clippers include a considerable amount of metal that has been machined, or stamped or otherwise formed and assembled together. This is considerably more expensive than plastic, for example. However, all prior art designs that have opposing parallel cutting blades which provide simultaneous cutting of the top and bottom of the nail have heretofore included a metallic nail clipper, with perhaps plastic surrounding certain components. This is because the mechanical stresses arising during use have precluded the use of a plastic body in the type of nail clipper that has opposing parallel cutting blades. It is also expensive to manufacture such prior art types of nail clippers due to the amount of metal that must be used.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The prior art opposing parallel blade nail clippers include a center post that engages with a pivoting lever, both of which are generally made from metal. A main body of the prior art nail clipper is also made from metal. The pivoting lever, pressing upon a ridge in the center post applies pressure to the clipper sufficient to urge a pair of opposite sides, and therefore also the opposing parallel blades, toward one-another during use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      There is a need for a nail clipper that is inexpensive to manufacture. There is a need for a disposable nail clipper that is also inexpensive to manufacture. A sufficiently inexpensive nail clipper could include an advertising and be given away or at offered at finer hotels or even sold for minimum cost, for example. There is need for a nail clipper that can meet any of these needs and which also has opposing parallel cutting blades.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Certain nail salon patrons may experience reluctance in using nail clippers that have been used on other nail salon patrons. At times, it is difficult to determine if proper sanitation procedures have been properly followed before the nail clipper is used on the next nail patron. The inexpensive nail clipper may be given to the nail salon patron for their own personal use while they are at the nail salon and then may be taken home for later use. That way the nail salon patron can be assured that the nail clipper that is used to cut their nails is sanitary.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Nail clippers are expensive because of the machining that is required to manufacture and assemble together the upper and lower metal portions, thereof. The top and bottom blades must not only be ground to a fine edge, but the cutting edges must align precisely. It is relatively inexpensive to make a blade, but the manufacturing of two blades with opposing parallel cutting edges that mesh precisely together drives up the cost of the nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Also, because nail clippers include so much metal, they are detected at airport security checks and often result in the searching of personal sundries that would not otherwise be so scrutinized. They may even be confiscated as a potentially dangerous weapon, which of course is a debatable assessment, but if confiscated it leaves the person without a nail clipper when they reach their destination. It is desirable to include sufficiently little metal with a nail clipper so that it does not generally register as a potential threat during airport security procedures.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Scissor-types of nail clippers with a plastic body and metal cutting blades are known, but are substantially different than nail clippers with opposing parallel blades that simultaneously cut both sides of the nail along the entire longitudinal length of the blades. The scissor-type of nail clipper is always severing the nail at a point, not along a line. Therefore, the scissor-type of nail clipper experiences only the smallest fraction of mechanical stress that is experienced by nail clippers with opposing parallel blades. However, scissor-types of nail clippers have many disadvantages. They increase the risk of cutting the finger of a user and are difficult to control. They also require more time to cut each nail than opposing parallel blade nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, there exists today a need for a nail clipper with opposing parallel blades that helps to ameliorate the above-mentioned problems and difficulties as well as ameliorate those additional problems and difficulties as may be recited in the “OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION” or discussed elsewhere in the specification or which may otherwise exist or occur and that are not specifically mentioned herein.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As various embodiments of the instant invention help provide a more elegant solution to the various problems and difficulties as mentioned herein, or which may otherwise exist or occur and are not specifically mentioned herein, and by a showing that a similar benefit is not available by mere reliance upon the teachings of relevant prior art, the instant invention attests to its novelty. Therefore, by helping to provide a more elegant solution to various needs, some of which may be long-standing in nature, the instant invention further attests that the elements thereof, in combination as claimed, cannot be obvious in light of the teachings of the prior art to a person of ordinary skill and creativity.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Clearly, such an apparatus would be useful and desirable.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Description of Prior Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Nail clippers are, in general, known. For example, the following patent documents describe various types of these devices, some of which may have some degree of relevance to the invention. Other patent documents listed below may not have any significant relevance to the invention. The inclusion of these patent documents is not an admission that their teachings anticipate any aspect of the invention. Rather, their inclusion is intended to present a broad and diversified understanding regarding the current state of the art appertaining to either the field of the invention or possibly to other related or even distal fields of invention. </p>

                        <p>      A fourth continuing object of the invention is to provide a nail clipper with opposing parallel blades that is lightweight.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A fifth continuing object of the invention is to provide a nail clipper with opposing parallel blades that includes a first blade portion that is formed of a metallic or other suitable material and a second blade portion that is formed of a metallic or other suitable material and wherein a remainder of the nail clipper is not formed of the same material as are the first and the second blade portions.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A sixth continuing object of the invention is to provide a nail clipper with opposing parallel blades that includes a first blade portion and a second blade portion that absorb mechanical stresses that occur during use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A seventh continuing object of the invention is to provide a nail clipper with opposing parallel blades that includes a first blade portion and a second blade portion that, when a downward force is applied by a pivoting lever, the first blade portion and the second blade portion are urged toward one another to provide a means for simultaneously cutting an upper and a lower portion of a fingernail or a toenail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Briefly, a nail clipper with opposing parallel blades that is constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention has a main body consisting of a plastic frame. The plastic frame, according to one embodiment, resembles an elongated “U-shape” in appearance. If desired, the plastic frame may be made of another material such as nylon or polymer or it may include a generally “V-shape”. The frame includes a pair of cutting blades that are placed over a pair of end portions of the frame. The pair of cutting blades includes a first blade portion and a second blade portion. The first blade portion and the second blade portion are preferably made from steel and are included at the end portions of the frame. The first and the second blade portions are attached to the end portions of the frame by friction or by any other preferred means. If desired, a recess may be provided on the end portions of the frame. A protrusion may also be included on each of the first and the second blade portions or the locations of the recess and the protrusion may be reversed. The protrusion on each of the first and the second blade portions cooperatively engage with each of the recesses on the end portions of the frame to secure the first and the second blade portions onto the frame. A center rod extends vertically through the first blade portion, through a first of the pair of end portions of the frame, through a second of the pair of end portions of the frame, and through the second blade portion. A pair of rivet-like ends, machine screws, or other means hold the center rod in position and secure each end of the center rod proximate the first and the second blade portions. The center rod can also be used to secure the first and the second blade portions in the desired position on the end portions of the frame. A pivoting lever is provided that includes a lower portion of the pivoting lever that, during use, the lower portion of the pivoting lever is disposed directly over a top surface of the first blade portion. A lower end of the pivoting lever includes a slight change of angle. The pivoting lever is preferably made from a strong plastic. If desired, the pivoting lever may also be made from steel or any other desired material. The pivoting lever may include any suitable preferred design. The pivoting lever is used to supply a downward force on the top surface of the first blade portion and a simultaneous upward force on a bottom surface of the second (or lower) blade portion. The force applied by the pivoting lever urges the first blade portion and the second blade portion closer together. When urged into a fully closed position, a first cutting edge of the first blade portion is able to contact a second cutting edge of the second blade portion along a longitudinal length of the first and second cutting edges. Together, the first cutting edge and the second cutting edge provide a means for simultaneously cutting a top and a bottom surface of a nail or a toenail that has been placed between the two cutting edges along the longitudinal length of the first and the second cutting edges. Once the downward force is no longer being applied to the pivoting lever, hysteresis of the frame urges the first and the second cutting edges away from one another. If desired, an additional amount of plastic material may be included within the curved portion between a top half and a bottom half of the frame to help urge the first and the second cutting edges apart. The additional plastic material, if included, providesextra support for the frame and to urge the frame in a quiescent spaced-apart open state after cutting has occurred. An alternate modified embodiment of the nail clipper includes a modified plastic frame that includes a straight, rather than a curved, frame design. If desired, a wedge is included between a top and a bottom half of the modified frame distally with respect to the first and second blade portions. The wedge, if included, provides additional structural integrity to the modified frame and an additional force to urge the frame into the open state. The modified frame may include two separate pieces that are fused (i.e., welded) together or the modified frame may be molded together at an end distally disposed with respect to the blades. Alternately, a retaining clip may be included which holds the top half and the bottom half of the modified frame together. A modified pivoting lever is included on a top surface of the first blade portion. The downward force is applied by the modified pivoting lever to the top surface of the first blade portion and to the bottom surface of the second (or lower) blade portion. The first and the second cutting edges of the first and the second blade portions sever the nail which is placed between the two cutting edges. Once the downward force is no longer being applied, the blade portions of the modified nail clipper return to a quiescent spaced-apart open state.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring on occasion to all of the FIGURE drawings and now, in particular to  FIG. 1 , is shown a nail clipper with opposing parallel blades, identified in general, by the reference numeral  10 . While steel is preferred, any suitable material other than steel may also be used to form the blades, such as ceramic or sufficiently hard composite materials. While the following description refers specifically to steel blades, it is to be understood that other suitable materials may be used for the blades.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The reader will notice that reference is occasionally made throughout the DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION suggesting that the reader refer to a particular drawing FIGURE. The suggestion is at times made when the introduction of a new element requires the reader to refer to a different drawing FIGURE than the one currently being viewed and also when the timely viewing of another drawing FIGURE is believed to significantly improve ease of reading or enhance understanding. To promote rapid understanding of the instant invention the reader is encouraged to periodically refer to and review each of the drawing FIGURES for possible cross-referencing of component parts and for other potentially useful information.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Certain examples are shown in the above-identified FIGURES and are described in greater detail below. In describing these examples, like or identical reference numerals may be used to identify common or similar elements.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">one-piece plastic frame  12</span>  that is molded out of a sufficient grade of plastic, nylon, or other preferred material that is not a metal. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  resembles an elongated “U-shape” in appearance. It is to be understood that many variations in shape are possible for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> . Additionally, and as described in greater detail hereinafter, it is possible to modify the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  so that it is formed of two or more pieces that are cooperatively secured (or attached) together at a distal end, thereof.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  can be any desired color of plastic. For example, a pink color of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  may appeal to girls and women whereas another color may be more likely to appeal to boys and men.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If desired, an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">advertisement  14</span>  is provided wherever preferred on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> . Also if desired, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  may include sections or portions, thereof, that are formed of different materials. For example, one grade of plastic may be used to form the structural parts of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  and a different grade of plastic or other type of material, may be included as an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">insert  15</span>  (within dashed lines) to house the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">advertisement  14</span>  (i.e., advertising). Refer also to  FIG. 9  and the description of  FIG. 9  regarding the use of different grades of plastic. In this way, the same overall basic version of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  can be produced for a wide variety of different purposes as <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">different inserts  15</span>  can b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">e produced for different advertisements  14</span>  to meet the needs of different advertisers. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">inserts  15</span>  can be of any desired depth and can also be designed to snap in place, if desired. If desired, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">inserts  15</span>  can be disposed on any surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Hotels and other companies of any type who wish to increase customer awareness of their products (or services) can include their name, telephone number, and website as part of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">advertisement  14</span> . The nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  may also be an amenity that is provided by a hotel.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In addition, the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  may be offered for free (or at a small cost) at a nail salon.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Every time a person who has received one of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  for free cuts his or her nails, they are apt to be reminded of the company (i.e., hotel, nail salon, etc.) that provided the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span> . If repeated enough times, when a purchase decision is required by the person for a product or service offered by the company, it is likely that the name of the company will spring favorably to mind.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b . If desired, a greater amount of plas<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">tic or any other (elastomeric) material  16</span>  (shown in dashed lines) may be included or added as an insert near a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">rear portion  12</span>   c  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">plastic or other material  16</span>  is used to urge the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  away from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  back into a quiescent spaced-apart open state.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span> . The first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  are preferably formed of steel, although other materials, for example a ceramic material, or any other suitable composite or other material can be used to form the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20 , as desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As there is little metal (i.e., steel) used for the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  an unexpected benefit is provided. Airport security devices are not likely to detect the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  during security screening. This prevents delays and possible confiscation of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  by overly zealous airport security personnel.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  is urged over a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">first end  13</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  is urged over a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">second end  13</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> . Both of the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  are preferably held in place by friction although other means, such as the use of an adhesive may be used. If desired, the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  can be crimped to secure the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  in place during insertion onto the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> . Further means for securing the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  are described in greater detail, hereinafter.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  includes a small piece of planar material that includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first cutting member  18</span>   a  that extends downward from a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">top planar surface  9</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span> , as shown in  FIG. 1 . If preferred, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first cutting member  18</span>   a  could be modified to extend outward and downward from a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">bottom planar surface  9</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span> . See  FIG. 8  and  FIG. 9  for other examples extending outward and downward.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first cutting member  18</span>   a  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first cutting member  18</span>   a  includes a planar portion that extends outward from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">top planar surface  9</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  and then bends downward to include approximately a ninety-degree radius. A radius that is less than or greater that ninety-degrees is also possible. A remainder of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first cutting member  18</span>   a  extends in a downward direction with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  disposed at a bottom end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first cutting member  18</span>   a.     </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  also includes a small piece of planar material that includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second cutting member  20</span>   a  that extends upward from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span> , and is disposed closest toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">top or upper half  12</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second cutting member  20</span>   a  is identical to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first cutting member  18</span>   a , just oriented upside down with respect thereto. Therefore, the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  are preferably identical, just inverted. This helps to decrease manufacturing costs.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second cutting member  20</span>   a  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second cutting member  20</span>   a  includes a planar portion that extends outward from a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">bottom planar surface  7</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  and then bends to include approximately a ninety-degree radius. As long as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a  abut each other when the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  is disposed in the fully closed position, any desired radius for the bend is possible. A remainder of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second cutting member  20</span>   a  extends in a upward direction with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a  parallel with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first cutting member  18</span>   a.     </p>
                    
                        <p>      As described in greater detail, hereinafter, the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second cutting members  18</span>   a ,  20   a  can be straight or curved, but the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a  are always on the same plane so that when urged together they abut each other along their respective longitudinal lengths. The first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second cutting members  18</span>   a ,  20   a  are ground or otherwise formed into the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">second cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a . The first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second cutting members  18</span>   a ,  20   a  preferably include opposing tapered surfaces, as shown, that terminate at a center to form the first and second cutting edges. Alternately, the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">second cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  may be disposed at an interior or at an exterior of the first or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second cutting members  18</span>   a ,  20   a  with only one tapered surface extending to the opposite side. Accordingly, the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">second cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  may align with a center longitudinal axis of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second cutting members  18</span>   a ,  20   a  or they may align with an interior or exterior edge of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second cutting members  18</span>   a ,  20   a.     </p>
                    
                        <p>      As mentioned previously, the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  are preferably made from steel. As the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second cutting members  18</span>   a ,  20   a  are extensions of the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  they too are also preferably formed of steel, although other materials, such as a ceramic or other suitable material can be used, if desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  is considerably less expensive to manufacture than a prior art opposing parallel steel blade type of nail clipper (not shown) for several reasons. First, the steel that is used to form the body of the prior art type of nail clipper is eliminated by the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span> . Second, the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  use very little steel and can be stamped out of sheet stock with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  easily ground on a distal edge of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second cutting members  18</span>   a ,  20   a  and then bent to include the desired radius. Third, by ensuring that the overall length of the upper and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower halves  12</span>   a ,  12   b  are the same, such as by precision molding techniques or by grinding (i.e., removing) excess material off the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">ends  13</span>   a ,  13   b  and by controlling the amount (depth) the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  are inserted over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">ends  13</span>   a ,  13   b  of the upper and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower halves  12</span>   a ,  12   b , it is easy to ensure that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  will align and abut each other when the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  is urged into a closed position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring briefly to  FIGS. 5 and 6 , are shown two different types of cutting edges that may be included with the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  or any modified version, thereof.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        FIG. 5  is a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">view taken along line  5</span> - 5  of  FIG. 3  and it shows a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">possible curved cutting edge  22</span>  that can be included with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  and also, of necessity, with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a , if desired. When urged together, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">curved cutting edges  22</span>  of the (slightly modified) first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  abut each other along their entire longitudinal length. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">curved cutting edges  22</span>  of the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  are disposed on the same horizontal plane and are parallel with respect to each other when disposed in the quiescent spaced-apart position and when abutting each other, or anywhere in-between.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">curved cutting edge  22</span>  is used to provide a more rounded cut to a fingernail or toenail (not shown). The rounded cut may appeal to certain users who wish to have their nails correspond with a natural curvature of their fingertips or toes.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        FIG. 6  is a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">view taken along line  6</span> - 6  of  FIG. 1  and it shows a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">possible straight cutting edge  24</span>  that is shown for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a  of  FIGS. 1 and 4 . When urged together, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">straight cutting edge  24</span>  of the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">second cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  abut each other along their entire longitudinal horizontal length. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">straight cutting edges  24</span>  of the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">second cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  are disposed on the same plane and are parallel with respect to each other when disposed in the quiescent spaced-apart position and when abutting each other, or anywhere in-between.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">straight cutting edge  24</span>  provides a linear cut across the entire longitudinal length of the fingernail or toenail, which may appeal to users who wish to have their nails cut straight and not rounded. Alternately, a rounded cut can be achieved by the cutting of several shorter straight sections of nail and by filing the intersecting corners.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Now referring back to  FIG. 1 , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  is used to urge the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second cutting members  18</span>   a ,  20   a  closer to one another to be able to simultaneously cut the upper and lower surfaces of the finger or the toenail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  is preferably made from a strong plastic material, or if desired, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  may be made from steel or any other preferred material. However, if steel is used, manufacturing costs for the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  will increase.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  is pivotally attached to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  will be described in greater detail, hereinafter. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  (and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">modified pivoting lever  106</span> ) are shown in a position for cutting of the fingernail or toenail. It is possible to rotate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  in a direction opposite that as shown by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">arrow  28</span>  and then rotate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  about a center longitudinal axis of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  to dispose the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  in a compact position for transport of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span> . The same is possible for a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">modified pivoting lever  106</span>  (see  FIG. 4 ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A downward force, as shown by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">arrow  28</span> , is applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">downward force  28</span>  urges a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lower portion  26</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  onto the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">top planar surface  9</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is important to note that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lower portion  26</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  contacts the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">top planar surface  9</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span> . This provides a significant unexpected benefit. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">downward force  28</span>  is only applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span> . There is no significant stress from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">downward force  28</span>  applied to any of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  merely supplies the structure necessary to maintain the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  in alignment during use. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  also supplies the force necessary to urge the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  apart when no more force is being applied to the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  by urging the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">arrow  28</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This allows the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  to be made from a sufficiently lesser grade of plastic or other material. In addition, the lesser grade of plastic is less expensive to manufacture and, in turn, allows the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  to be manufactured at a lower cost or disposable. As mentioned before, the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  can even be given away for free.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As mentioned previously, the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  may be offered as an amenity to a hotel guest or nail salon patron. Therefore, it is desirable to keep manufacturing costs down in order to provide the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  at little added cost or even at no cost to the hotel guest or nail salon patron.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  are urged toward each other when a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">sufficient downward force  28</span>  is applied to overcome resistance from cutting through the nail that is disposed between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a  during use. See also  FIG. 9 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      When urged together into the fully closed position, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a  are parallel, align sufficiently well with respect to each other, and abut each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A fingernail or a toenail is inserted between the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">second cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  prior to application of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">downward force  28</span>  onto the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span> . The upper and lower surfaces of the fingernail or the toenail are simultaneously severed when <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">sufficient downward force  28</span>  is applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  to urge the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  toward each other and thereby cause the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">curved cutting edge  22</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">straight cutting edge  24</span>  (whichever is included) to sever the nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Typically, a thumb and finger of an opposite hand of a user (not shown) can supply the downward force onto the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  to sever the nail. As mentioned previously, the downward force is applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">top planar surface  9</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span> . Simultaneously, an upward force is applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">bottom planar surface  7</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span> . Accordingly, when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  is urged in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">arrow  28</span> , a downward force is urging the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  downward while a simultaneous upward force is urging the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  upward.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Once the downward force is no longer being applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">top planar surface  9</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  and the upward force is no longer being applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">bottom planar surface  7</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span> , normal hysteresis of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  returns the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  to a spaced-apart quiescent open state. The additi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">onal plastic material or other material  16</span> , if included, also helps to return the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  to the quiescent spaced-apart open position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Now referring to  FIG. 2 , is shown a cross-sectional view of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing paral<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">lel blades  10</span>  taken along line  2</span> - 2  of  FIG. 1 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  extends vertically through a hole provided in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span> , a hole provided through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span> , a hole provided through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">first end portion  13</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> , through a hole provided through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">second end portion  13</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> , and through a hole provided through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  is preferably made from steel, however any sufficiently strong material may be used.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">rivet ends  32</span>   a ,  32   b  are provided at opposite ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  to secure the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  in position with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">rivets  32</span>   a ,  32   b  are also preferably made from steel or may be integrally formed of the same sufficiently strong material that is used to form the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">rivets  32</span>   a ,  32   b  secure each end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  proximate the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">rivets  32</span>   a ,  32   b  also withstand the forces that occur when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  is urged in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">arrow  28</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If preferred, the opposing ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  can include screw threads (not shown) and threaded nuts can be used at either or at both ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span> . Also if preferred, the opposing ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  can be bent during assembly to include a ninety-degree bend, thereby eliminating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">rivet ends  32</span>   a ,  32   b . Other means for securing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  in position are also possible.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Unlike all known prior art types of opposing parallel blade types of nail clippers, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  are separate parts with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> . In addition, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  are not formed of a continuous piece of metal that includes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  (as in prior art nail clippers). Because the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  are not continuous portions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> , the need for precision machining of the first cutting and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">second cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">curved cutting edge  22</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">straight cutting edge  24</span>  with respect to each other is eliminated. Instead, proper attachment of the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  is used to ensure proper positioning of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  with respect to one-another for the instant invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This greatly reduces the cost of manufacture because the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span> , being separate components, are easy to manufacture and to machine the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">desired cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  and also because it is easy to ensure proper positioning during assembly. This is discussed in greater detail, hereinafter.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  are preferably secured to the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower halves  12</span>   a ,  12   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  by friction. However, many ways (means) of securing the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  are possible, such as crimping the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  or by the use of an adhesive. It is also important to note that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  passing through the hole through the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">second end portions  13</span>   a ,  13   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  is also useful in securing and properly aligning the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  with respect to each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Now referring also to  FIG. 3 , is shown an exploded view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span> . Construction of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  is similar.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      However, the  FIG. 3  illustration shows the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">modified curved cutting edge  22</span>  instead of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">straight cutting edge  24</span>  of the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">second cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  of  FIGS. 1 and 4 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring momentarily also to  FIG. 5 , which shows the curvature of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first cutting member  18</span>   a  when viewed from the bottom and also to  FIG. 7 , which shows how the cutting edge is also planar (i.e., disposed on a horizontal plane). All versions of the instant invention include p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">arallel planar horizontal cutting edges  22</span> ,  24  whether the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">cutting edges  22</span> ,  24  are s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">traight<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> ( 24</span> ) or curved ( 22</span> ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring again to  FIG. 3 , if desired, a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">protrusions  34</span>   a ,  34   b  may be included on an interior of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  to further secure and help align the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  with respect to each other and to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">protrusions  34</span>   a ,  34   b  extend inward from an interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  and from an interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As shown, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  includes an open end that is located at an opposite end with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first cutting member  18</span>   a . The open end allows for insertion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">first end portion  13</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  of the frame within the interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  also includes the open end opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second cutting member  20</span>   a  and similarly receives the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">second end portion  13</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">second end portions  13</span>   a ,  13   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  may be slightly tapered to allow for easier insertion into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  (or into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span> ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">second end portions  13</span>   a ,  13   b  preferably each include a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">recesses  36</span>   a ,  36   b . When the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  are urged sufficiently far over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">end portions  13</span>   a ,  13   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">recesses  36</span>   a ,  36   b  cooperatively engage with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">protrusions  34</span>   a ,  34   b  included on the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  and help secure the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  at a desired location with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  and, therefore, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  are also secured in parallel planar alignment with respect to each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Once the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">protrusions  34</span>   a ,  34   b  are engaged within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">recesses  36</span>   a ,  36   b , the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  are secured to the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">second end portions  13</span>   a ,  13   b  of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower halves  12</span>   a ,  12   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Alternately if desired, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">stopper  38</span>  (partially shown in dashed lines in  FIG. 3 ) may be included as part of the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  especially if the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">protrusions  34</span>   a ,  34   b  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">recesses  36</span>   a ,  36   b  are omitted. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">stopper  38</span>  is used to limit how far the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">first end  13</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">second end  13</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  are inserted into the open end of either the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring again to  FIG. 2 , a gap, identified in general by the reference numeral  5 , is provided on a side of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  that is opposite with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">top planar surface  9</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">bottom planar surface  7</span>   a . If desired, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">gap  5</span>  could be eliminated, however, additional holes (not shown) would need to be provided to allow for passage of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  through the metal that would then be present where the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">gap  5</span>  is currently included on the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Now referring to  FIG. 4 , is shown a modified nail clipper with opposing parallel blades, identified in general by the reference numeral  100 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">opposing parallel blades  100</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">plastic straight frame  102</span>  that is reminiscent of the shape of similar prior art all steel nail clippers (not shown). The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">straight frame  102</span>  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">upper half  102</span>   a  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">lower half  102</span>   b.     </p>
                    
                        <p>      The upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">lower halves  102</span>   a ,  102   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">straight frame  102</span>  are preferably planar in appearance and, as shown, are separate although the upper and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">lower halves  102</span>   a ,  102   b  could be molded together as a unit, if preferred and they may include many variations in size, shape, or appearance.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If desired, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">wedge  104</span>  can be included at a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">rear  102</span>   c  of the modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">opposing parallel blades  100</span>  between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">upper half  102</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">lower half  102</span>   b . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">wedge  104</span>  helps to urge the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">upper half  102</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">lower half  102</span>   b  into the quiescent spaced-apart open position where they are disposed maximally apart at a front end, thereof. If desired, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">wedge  104</span>  is welded (by ultrasound or other means) to the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">lower halves  102</span>   a ,  102   b  at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">rear  102</span>   c  or adhered (by an adhesive) or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">wedge  104</span>  may be molded and included as an integral part of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">straight frame  102</span>  so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">wedge  104</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">upper half  102</span>   a , and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">lower half  102</span>   b  are one continuous piece.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Injection molding or other known or future manufacturing techniques can, of course, be used to form any plastic part of either the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  or the modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">opposing parallel blades  100</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">modified pivoting lever  106</span>  is similar to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  and includes a different shape. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">modified pivoting lever  106</span>  is preferably made of plastic and it includes a thickness and strength suitable for the forces it experiences during use. If preferred the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span> , as shown in  FIG. 1 , may instead be used. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">modified pivoting lever  106</span>  is pivotally attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span> , as previously described for the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">modified pivoting lever  106</span>  helps illustrate that many possible designs are possible for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  or for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">modified pivoting lever  106</span>  for any′ version of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  100 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">opposing parallel blades  100</span>  includes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  that are identical or substantially similar to that of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span> . The first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  are secured by friction, or may include the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">protrusions  34</span>   a ,  34   b  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">recesses  36</span>   a ,  36   b  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">stopper  38</span> , as previously described. Alternately the design of the modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">opposing parallel blades  100</span>  (or of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span> ) may rely entirely on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">rivet-like ends  32</span>   a ,  32   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  to secure the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  in position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  of the modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">opposing parallel blades  100</span>  also includes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  of the modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">opposing parallel blades  100</span>  also includes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a . The first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  are substantially identical to that of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span> . In addition, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">curved cutting edge  22</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">straight cutting edge  24</span>  may be included on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a , or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a , as desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      When the downward force is applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">modified pivoting lever  106</span>  in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">arrow  28</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">lower portion  106</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">modified pivoting lever  106</span>  applies the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">downward force  28</span>  onto the top surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">bottom rivet  32</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  simultaneously applies an upward force to the bottom of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span> . The downward and upward forces urge the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  closer together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The downward force supplied by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">lower portion  106</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">modified pivoting lever  106</span>  along with upward force supplied by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">bottom rivet  32</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  helps urge the upper and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">lower halves  102</span>   a ,  102   b  closer to one-another as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">modified pivoting lever  106</span>  is further depressed. This causes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  to move toward each other until the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a  align with each and abut other to simultaneously sever the upper and the lower surfaces of the fingernail or toenail placed there-between. This is the same as occurs with the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">opposing parallel blades  100</span>  shares the advantages of being lightweight, inexpensive to manufacture, available at a low retail cost, able to include space for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">adverti<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">sement  14</span>  or insert  15</span> , containing a minimal amount of metal (i.e., steel), less chance of detection by airport security devices and most importantly, providing for the simultaneous cutting of both sides of the nail along the entire length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  while distributing the bulk of the forces and stresses that are experienced to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">blades  18</span> ,  20  and minimizing the forces and stresses that are experienced by the upper and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">lower halves  102</span>   a ,  102   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">straight frame  102</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If desired, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">retaining clip  108</span>  can be inserted over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">rear end  102</span>   c  portions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">straight frame  102</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">wedge  104</span> , to secure them together. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">retaining clip  108</span> , if included, is formed of metal or any preferred material, and can be crimped, urged or adhered in place to provide a low-cost manufacturing method.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">retaining clip  108</span>  may include any preferred color and, if desired, may include an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105">opening  105</span>  through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">retaining clip  108</span>  and through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">rear  102</span>   c  of the modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">opposing parallel blades  100</span>  that can be used to receive a key ring (not shown) to attach the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">opposing parallel blades  100</span>  to a set of keys for easy portability or a ring (not shown) can be attached where desired to any version of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  100 ,  200  (the other versions being described in greater detail, hereinafter).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If desired, for any version of the instant invention, a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">opposing limits  101</span>   a ,  101   b  (shown in dashed lines) can be included (adhered, fused, welded or molded) into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">upper half  102</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">lower half  102</span>   b  to limit the degree of motion possible as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a  are urged together. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">opposing limits  101</span>   a ,  101   b  abut each other to prevent further motion and can be useful in preventing damage from occurring if excessive force is applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">modified pivoting lever  106</span>  (or if excessive force is applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span> ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If preferred, any portion of any version of the instant invention as described herein that is formed of a plastic, nylon, or polymer, for example, can include either a solid core or a hollow core. Proper selection of materials and skillful design will, of course, allow minimal use of the plastic, nylon, or polymer. Not only does minimal use reduce manufacturing cost, it also reduces weight, which in turn, can substantially reduce shipping costs. This is especially true when compared with the known prior art types of all steel nail clippers. Also, a lower weight makes portage of the instant invention easier to accomplish, whether it is placed in a pocket, purse, or added to a keychain, for example.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      What is especially important to note is that the design of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  and the modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">opposing parallel blades  100</span>  and any related version of the instant invention is that the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  are extended (i.e., include a sufficientl<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">y long [or extended] top planar surface  9</span>   a  and a sufficiently l<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">ong [or extended] bottom planar surface  7</span>   a ) to allow the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  to pass through the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  and to also apply the downward force during use to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">top planar surface  9</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  or by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">modified pivoting lever  106</span> . Accordingly, the downward cutting force is applied directly to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span> . Similarly, the upward force during cutting is applied directly to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The instant invention, thereby, provides a significant benefit over the known prior art types of all steel nail clippers with parallel opposing blades by allowing the use of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> ,  102  made of plastic and attached steel first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  which are easily capable of withstanding the mechanical stresses that occur during use (i.e., cutting of the fingernail or toenail.)  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The instant invention also provides a significant improvement over the plastic frame and steel blade versions that are disclosed in the earlier-filed related patent applications that applied the downward and upward forces to the plastic frame members which then transferred these forces to the steel blades. The earlier-described plastic frame members of the related patent applications experience considerable mechanical stress, especially at the interface to the steel blades, and are, therefore, more subject to fracture or deformation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      However, the instant invention, by applying the forces directly to the top and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">bottom planar surfaces  9</span>   a ,  7   a  of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20 , respectively, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">plastic frame  12</span> ,  102  is spared from much of the mechanical stress that occurs during cutting. The first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  are easily able to withstand such forces and mechanical stresses. With the instant invention very little stress is experienced by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> ,  102  during cutting of the nail. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> ,  102  of the instant invention is used, primarily, to maintain alignment of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  of the first and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  with respect to each other and to urge the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  apart after each cut has been accomplished.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to  FIG. 8  is shown a second modified nail clipper with opposing parallel blades, identified in general by the reference numeral  200 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The second modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">opposing parallel blades  200</span>  includes a plastic modified straight frame, as identified in general by reference numeral  202 , that includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified upper half  202</span>   a  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified lower half  202</span>   b.     </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified upper half  202</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified lower half  202</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified straight frame  202</span>  each include a rear straight portion, identified by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204">bracket  204</span> , and a forward straight portion, identified by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206">bracket  206</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204">rear straight portions  204</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified upper half  202</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified lower half  202</span>   b  are fused together or sonically welded together or adhered together or molded together to form the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified straight frame  202</span> . This eliminates the need for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">retaining clip  108</span> . By selection of the materials used, including control of the thickness it is also possible to eliminate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">wedge  104</span>  with the second modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">opposing parallel blades  200</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">wedge  104</span>  may also be eliminated from any other version, as desired if normal hysteresis is sufficient to urge the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  100 ,  200 ,  300  into the open position or if a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem109">spring  109</span>  (see  FIG. 4 ) is included.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The second modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">opposing parallel blades  200</span>  shows a modification to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">blades  18</span> ,  20  that is possible with all versions. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first blade portion  18</span>   b  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first cutting member  18</span>   c . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first cutting member  18</span>   c  extends downward from a bottom of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first blade portion  18</span>   b  (instead of from the top). The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first blade portion  18</span>   b  is made of steel or any sufficiently strong material. A remainder of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first blade portion  18</span>   b  (other than the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first cutting member  18</span>   c ) wraps around at least a portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified upper half  202</span>   a , as is common with all versions of the invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In particular, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first blade portion  18</span>   b  extends over the top of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified upper half  202</span>   a  (or over the top of an end of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">any upper plastic half  12</span>   a ,  102   a ) to ensure that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">modified pivoting le<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">ver  106</span>  (or any pivoting lever  26</span> ) will bear down on the hard steel surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first blade portion  18</span>   b  and not on the plastic of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified upper half  202</span>   a  (i.e., not on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">plastic upper half  12</span>   a ,  102   a  of any version).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second blade portion  20</span>   b  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second cutting member  20</span>   c . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second cutting member  20</span>   c  extends upward from a top of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second blade portion  20</span>   b , toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first cutting member  18</span>   c . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second blade portion  20</span>   b  is similarly made of steel or any sufficiently strong material, as desired. A remainder of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second blade portion  20</span>   b  (other than the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second cutting member  20</span>   c ) wraps around at least a portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified lower half  202</span>   b , as is common with all versions of the invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In particular, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second blade portion  20</span>   b  extends over the bottom of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified lower half  202</span>   b  (or over the bottom of an end of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">any lower plastic half  12</span>   b ,  102   b ) to ensure that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">lower or bottom rivet-like end  32</span>   b  will bear upwards against the hard steel surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second blade portion  20</span>   b  during use (i.e., during cutting of the fingernail or toenail) and not bear on the plastic of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified lower half  202</span>   b  (i.e., not on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">plastic lower half  12</span>   b ,  102   b  of any version).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This configuration allows for a portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified upper half  202</span>   a  to extend forward of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first blade portion  18</span>   b  and to function as an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">upper safety bumper  208</span> . It also allows for a portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified lower half  202</span>   b  to extend forward of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second blade portion  20</span>   b  and to function as a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">lower safety bumper  210</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      During use, a fleshy part of any finger, thumb, or toe (not shown) that is disposed under the fingernail or toenail will contact one of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">safety bumpers  208</span> ,  210  and help to limit the depth of cut that is possible. This prevents excessive cutting from occurring and can prevent injury or bleeding. The risk of infection from a cut is also greatly reduced. The amount of protrusion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">safety bumpers  208</span> ,  210  can also be varied to provide different types of cut (i.e., longer or shorter fingernails and toenails), as desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The configuration of the second modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">opposing parallel blades  200</span>  provides an advantage during manufacture. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">upper safety bumper  208</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">lower safety bumper  210</span>  include a thickness that is less than a thickness of a remainder of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified upper half  202</span>   a  and a remainder of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified lower half  202</span>   b . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem215">step  215</span>  is provided at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified upper half  202</span>   a  and at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified lower half  202</span>  an equal distance from a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem217">left end  217</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem215">step  215</span>  is where the thickness of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified upper half  202</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified lower half  202</span>   b  decreases to the lesser thickness of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">upper safety bumper  208</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">lower safety bumper  210</span> . It should be noted that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first blade portion  18</span>   b  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second blade portion  20</span>   b  are identical components that are installed during manufacture on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified upper half  202</span>   a  and on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified lower half  202</span>   b  in an upside-down relationship with respect to each other. This lowers cost of manufacture by using the same component part for both the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first blade portion  18</span>   b  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second blade portion  20</span>   b.     </p>
                    
                        <p>      During manufacture, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first blade portion  18</span>   b  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second blade portion  20</span>   b  are placed over the ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">upper safety bumper  208</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">lower safety bumper  210</span>  and urged in a direction toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem217">left end  217</span>  until the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first blade portion  18</span>   b  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second blade portion  20</span>   b  make contact with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem215">each respective step  215</span> . Friction or protrusions and recesses or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center post  30</span>  or other means, as desired, retain the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first blade portion  18</span>   b  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second blade portion  20</span>   b  in position. See also  FIG. 9  for an alternate way of securing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This method of construction and assembly ensures that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a , which are included on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first cutting member  18</span>   c  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second cutting member  20</span>   c , will also be disposed the same distance away from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem217">left end  217</span>  and, therefore, align with respect to each other during use (i.e., cutting of the fingernail or toenail). As such, a simple and especially low cost method of manufacture is provided that ensures rapid assemble and proper alignment of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a  with respect to each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As mentioned earlier, a primary significant advantage is provided by any version of the instant invention. The force necessary to urge the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">second cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  together is applied to the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  (or to the modified first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span>   b ,  20   b  or to the blade portions of any version of the instant invention) and not to the material (i.e., the plastic) that is used to form the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper halves  12</span>   a ,  102   a ,  202   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower halves  12</span>   b ,  102   b ,  202   b.     </p>
                    
                        <p>      To illustrate this benefit refer momentarily to  FIG. 1 . When the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  of the instant invention is urged in a downward direction, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lower portion  26</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  is applying the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">downward force  28</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">top planar surface  9</span>   a  of the steel of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  and a simultaneous upward force is being applied to the top of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">upper rivet-like end  32</span>   a . Simultaneously, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">lower rivet-like end  32</span>   b  is applying an upward force to urge the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">bottom planar surface  7</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  in an upward direction toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, the majority of the cutting forces are experienced by the first and second blade portions.  18 ,  20  and not by the plastic material of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  experience only mild forces as they are urged toward one-another during the cutting of the fingernail or toenail. The minimal force that is experienced by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  is transferred to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  by the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  as they are being urged toward one-another.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  provide two especially important functions. First, they maintain proper alignment of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  to ensure that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a  are always parallel with respect to one-another (for any position, open or closed of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span> ) and to ensure that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a  will abut one-another when the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  is urged into the fully closed position. Second, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  are used to supply the outward force that urges the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  apart from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  into the open position when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  is not being urged in a downward direction (i.e., when not cutting the fingernail or the toenail). The outward force is supplied by the natural hysteresis of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  or by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">wedge  16</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem109">spring  109</span>  (see  FIG. 4 ), as desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Although explained in detail for the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  the above-described benefits apply to all versions of the instant invention where the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lower portion  26</span>   a ,  106   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">modified pivoting lever  106</span>  bears down on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">top planar surface  9</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span> , or on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first blade portion  18</span>   b  rather than bearing down directly on any portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">plastic frame  12</span> ,  102 ,  202 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To better appreciate the benefit of the instant invention consider that a great deal of force is required to urge the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">blade portions  18</span> ,  20 ,  18   b ,  20   b  together while simultaneously cutting across the width of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">second cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a . If the force is applied to the plastic frame portions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper halves  12</span>   a ,  102   a ,  202   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower halves  12</span>   b ,  102   b ,  202   b  as taught by prior art types of nail clippers with opposing parallel cutting blades (instead of being applied to the steel portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade  18</span> ), it (i.e., the force necessary to sever the nail) must then be transferred from the plastic frame portions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper halves  12</span>   a ,  102   a ,  202   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower halves  12</span>   b ,  102   b ,  202   b  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">the equivalent prior art blade portions  18</span> ,  20 ,  18   b ,  20   b.     </p>
                    
                        <p>      The force required is so substantial that there is likelihood of distortion (i.e., bending) or even breakage (i.e., cracking) of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper halves  12</span>   a ,  102   a ,  202   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower halves  12</span>   b ,  102   b ,  202   b  occurring if the force is applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">plastic frame  12</span> ,  102 ,  202  instead of being applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">(steel) blade portions  18</span> ,  20 ,  18   b ,  20   b . The instant design prevents the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper halves  12</span>   a ,  102   a ,  202   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower halves  12</span>   b ,  102   b ,  202   b  (i.e., the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">plastic frame  12</span> ,  102 ,  202 ) from experiencing such strong forces and mechanical stress during the cutting of the fingernail or toenail. As such, a much more durable device is provided and at very low cost.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to  FIG. 9  is shown a portion of a third modified nail clipper with opposing parallel blades, identified in general by the reference numeral  300 . The third modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">opposing parallel blades  300</span> , as shown, includes the modified first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blades  18</span>   a ,  20   b  of the second modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">opposing parallel blades  200</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The third modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">opposing parallel blades  300</span>  includes an opti<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">onal first modified lower safety bumper  302</span> . A remainder of the third modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">opposing parallel blades  300</span>  is similar to the second modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">opposing parallel blades  200</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span>  could be used with the third modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">opposing parallel blades  300</span> , if desired. Many variations are, of course, possible for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">straight frame  102</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">modified straight frame  202</span>  with any version of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  100 ,  200 ,  300 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">The first modified lower safety bumper  302</span>  extends outward from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second blade portion  20</span>   b  beyond the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a , and includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">curved profile  304</span>  that corresponds, in general, with the curvature of a fleshy part of a finger or toe.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      During use, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem306">finger  306</span>  (or toe) is urged in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem307">arrow  307</span>  so that a curved fleshy part  308  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem306">finger  306</span>  makes contact with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">curved profile  304</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">the first modified lower safety bumper  302</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem306">finger  306</span>  is placed between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a  when the third modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">opposing parallel blades  300</span>  is disposed in the open position, as shown. The user applies slight pressure of the fleshy part  308  against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">curved profile  304</span>  while urging the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  in a downward direction sufficient to sever at least some of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The above-described procedure for cutting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span>  is repeated for all of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernails  310</span>  and all of the toenails of the person. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">For each fingernail  310</span>  more than one cut will often be required to give the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span>  its desired finished appearance. The above-described procedure, in general, for cutting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span>  is used with all versions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  100 ,  200 ,  300 , whether or not <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">the first modified lower safety bumper  302</span> , or any version of a safety bumper is included.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is to be understood that the amount that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">curved profile  304</span>  protrudes in a direction opposite that of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem307">arrow  307</span>  is a design variable. A greater amount of the protrusion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">curved profile  304</span>  will result in a smaller amount of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span>  that will be severed for any given force (that the user applies) of the fleshy part  308  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">curved profile  304</span>  portion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">the first modified lower safety bumper  302</span>  in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem307">arrow  307</span> . Conversely, a lesser amount of the protrusion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">curved profile  304</span>  will result in a greater amount of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span>  that will be severed for any given force applied because a greater amount of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span>  will extend between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a  (in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem307">arrow  307</span> ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">curved profile  304</span>  provides numerous advantages and can be adapted for use with different embodiments or versions of the invention, as desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">curved profile  304</span>  provides a “controlled” cutting experience. The user cannot inadvertently remove too much of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span> . Removal of a greater amount of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span>  requires a deliberate action, as described below. The user is assured of receiving the type of cut that is desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A comfortable cutting experience is also provided because a substantial (i.e., a greater) area of the fleshy part  308  is in contact with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">curved profile  304</span>  during cutting. The larger contact area eliminates the possibility of an uncomfortable pressure point occurring. The cutting experience is more comfortable whether a slight force or greater force is applied urging the fleshy part  308  against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">curved profile  304</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      During use, another advantage is realized if the user applies a slight pressure initially during cutting. A slight pressure (for any degree of protrusion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">the first modified lower safety bumper  302</span> ) is used to remove a minimal amount of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span> . This allows for light trimming or, if desired, a French-cut type of manicure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Another significant advantage is provided after accomplishing an initial light trimming if, after viewing, the user desires to remove even more of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span> . The user can again place the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span>  in the proper position for cutting while applying an even greater force urging the fleshy part  308  against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">curved profile  304</span>  in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem307">arrow  307</span>  during cutting of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span> . This will remove an even greater amount of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span> . In this manner the desired cut is obtained. And, as mentioned above, deeper cutting requires a deliberate action (i.e., intentionally applying more force during cutting) which helps to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">prevent undesired excessive fingernail  310</span>  removal from occurring.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The third modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">opposing parallel blades  300</span>  illustrates how only the one (i.e., lower) side need include the safety bumper (in this instance, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">the first modified lower safety bumper  302</span> ) in order to obtain the benefits provided by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">the first modified lower safety bumper  302</span> . It is important to understand that inclusion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">the first modified lower safety bumper  302</span>  (or any other type of safety bumper) with any version of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  100 ,  200 ,  300  is optional. Any version of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">safety bumper  208</span> ,  210 ,  302  can be eliminated from the upper half of the third modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">opposing parallel blades  300</span> . This is also equally true with the second modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">opposing parallel blades  200</span>  and with any other embodiment of the invention. If preferred, any desired version of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">safety bumper  208</span> ,  210 ,  302  can be included on both sides (i.e., proximate both the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a ). It is also true that any version of the instant invention ( 10 ,  100 ,  200 ,  300 ), including other embodiments not shown herein, may omit the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">safety bumper  208</span> ,  210 ,  302 , as desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">curved profile  304</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">the first modified lower safety bumper  302</span>  can also be used to retain the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second blade portion  20</span>   b  in position on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> . This helps ensure proper positioning of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a  from a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem312">distal end  312</span>  of the third modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">opposing parallel blades  300</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">curved profile  304</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">the first modified lower safety bumper  302</span>  can also be repeated with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first blade portion  18</span>   b  to provide the desired alignment benefit of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem312">distal end  312</span>  and, therefore, with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">The first modified lower safety bumper  302</span>  can be attached to an end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  during assembly of it can be molded in place, as desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The third modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">opposing parallel blades  300</span> , as shown, also includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem314">optional molded insert  314</span>  proximate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem312">distal end  312</span>  between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem314">molded insert  314</span>  may be optionally included for a variety of reasons. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem314">molded insert  314</span>  can be formed of a more elastomeric type of material and function as a separating wedge by supplying an outward force to help urge the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  apart from each other. Also, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem314">molded insert  314</span>  can include a contrasting appearance for aesthetic enhancement. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem314">molded insert  314</span>  may also include <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem316">inner channels  316</span>  (shown in dashed lines) that are disposed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span>  that, during manufacture, are used to convey an additional quantity of the material that is used to form the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem314">molded insert  314</span>  to an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem318">upper exterior strip  318</span>  and to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">lower exterior strip  320</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem318">upper exterior strip  318</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">lower exterior strip  320</span>  help provide non-slip exterior surfaces that improves grip. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem318">upper exterior strip  318</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">lower exterior strip  320</span>  also help to provide enhanced appearance and attractiveness by providing a contrasting accent color. If desired, either or both of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem318">upper exterior strip  318</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">lower exterior strip  320</span>  can also be molded to include any desired indicia, brand name, logo or other desired markings, such as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">advertisement  14</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is also anticipated that a set of several of the third modified nail clippers with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">opposing parallel blades  300</span>  (or other version of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  100 ,  200 ,  300 ) can be provided, each having a different length of protrusion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">curved profile  304</span>  portion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">the first modified lower safety bumper  302</span> . If desired, a unique number could be assigned to each one of the several of the third modified nail clippers with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">opposing parallel blades  300</span>  so that an average depth of cut of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span>  is associated with each particular number.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      For example, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">number one (1</span>) could have a very large protrusion and thereby, the smallest amount of cut, whereas a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">number ten (10</span>) might have the smallest protrusion possible and, thereby, the greatest amount of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span>  cut occurring. These could be offered for sale individually. Individuals (users) could then purchase a version of the invention that corresponds with the depth of cut that they generally prefer.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Also, manicurists and pedicurists are likely to purchase a set that includes several different depths of cut (i.e., inversely proportional to the length of protrusion of the fleshy part  308  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">the first modified lower safety bumper  302</span> ) to use with their clients. Manicurists and pedicurists are likely to purchase one or a set of n<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">ail clippers ( 10</span> ,  100 ,  200 ,  300 ) that is especially durable and designed for a very long life and, in particular, for commercial use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is also important to note that the benefits of the s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">afety bumper ( 208</span> ,  210 ,  302 ) can also be applied to improve the performance of any prior art type of nail clipper (not shown). For example, referring now to  FIG. 10 , is shown a side view of a front portion of a modified lower cutting blade, identified in general by the reference numeral  400 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">The modified lower cutting blade  400</span>  can be used with the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">opposing parallel blades  10</span> , the modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">opposing parallel blades  100</span> , the third modified nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">opposing parallel blades  300</span> , or with any other embodiment of the invention by including the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">curved profile  304</span>  (of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">the first modified lower safety bumper  302</span> ) into the shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">lower blade  20</span> ,  20   b  by a bending of the steel that is used to form the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">blade  20</span> ,  20   b.     </p>
                    
                        <p>      The amount of protrusion forward of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a  is indicated by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem402">bracket  402</span> . Accordingly, the amount of protrusion can be varied along with its curvature profile, as previously described for <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">the first modified lower safety bumper  302</span> , to provide any desired depth of cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is important to note that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">modified lower cutting blade  400</span>  can be used with any desired prior art type of steel nail clipper (not shown, of the type where the blade and upper and lower body members are formed of steel) to provide a version of the safety bumper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Any of the teachings for any version of the instant invention can be applied, as desired, to any other version or to any further modified version (not shown) without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is also understood that any possible embodiment or version of the n<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">ail clipper ( 10</span> ,  100 ,  200 ,  300 ) can include either the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">straight cutting edge  24</span> , as shown in  FIG. 6 , or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">curved cutting edge  22</span> , as shown in  FIG. 5 , as preferred. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">curved cutting edge  22</span>  is generally preferred because when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">opposing parallel cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  are urged together, a curved cut of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span>  occurs that is closer in shape to a curvature of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span>  that many people prefer. However, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">straight cutting edge  24</span>  is also possible and may be less expensive to manufacture. Accordingly, versions of the n<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">ail clipper ( 10</span> ,  100 ,  200 ,  300 ) that include the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">straight cutting edge  24</span>  may be less expensive to purchase.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Approximating a desired overall curvature of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span>  is possible with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">straight cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  by taking numerous small cuts along the perimeter of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span> . If desired, an optional file (not shown) may be used to smooth the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">fingernail  310</span>  after cutting regardless of w<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">hether curved or straight cutting edges  22</span> ,  24  are used.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to  FIG. 11 , is shown a partial side view of a prior art type of a steel blade and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem500">steel body nail clipper  500</span>  with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem502">plastic surround sleeve  502</span>  that is disposed over and which surrounds the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem500">prior art clipper  500</span>  for the purpose of catching nail clippings during use. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem502">sleeve  502</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem504">sleeve protrusion  504</span>  that extends forward of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem504">sleeve protrusion  504</span>  includes any desired taper or curvature and functions as a further modified type of the safety bumper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to  FIG. 12  is shown a view in perspective of a type of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem600">blade  600</span>  of the current invention. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem600">blade  600</span>  is made of steel and surrounds a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem602">plastic member  602</span> . This illustrates that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem600">blade  600</span>  can completely surround the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem602">plastic member  602</span>  or, if preferred, it can include less material and not fully wrap around and surround the inside portions of the members (as shown in  FIG. 2 ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem604">hole  604</span>  is provided through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem600">blade  600</span>  and through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem602">plastic member  602</span>  for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  to pass there-through. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem604">hole  604</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">center rod  30</span>  also provide an alternate means for properly aligning the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">cutting edge  19</span>   a  a desired distance away from a distal portion (not shown) of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem602">plastic member  602</span>  to ensure that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  will align with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower second cutting edge  21</span>   a  that is similarly secured to a lower plastic member (not shown).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      An <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem606">adhesive safety bumper  606</span>  is shown in a spaced-apart orientation prior to its adhesion to a front surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem600">bla<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem602">de  600</span>  (and/or plastic member  602</span> ) above the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem606">adhesive safety bumper  606</span>  includes <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem608">any desired curvature  608</span>  for contact with the fleshy part  308  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem306">finger  306</span>  which helps to control or limit the amount of cut that occurs. An adhesive coating is applied to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem610">contact surface  610</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem606">adhesive safety bumper  606</span>  and is used to secure the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem606">adhesive safety bumper  606</span>  in position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A protective covering (not shown) is removed from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem610">contact surface  610</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem606">adhesive safety bumper  606</span>  is urged in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem612">arrow  612</span>  until it makes contact with the front surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem600">bla<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem602">de  600</span>  (and/or plastic member  602</span> ) above the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a . In this manner, a method and apparatus are shown for providing a safety bumper on prior art types of nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to  FIG. 13  is shown a cross-sectional view of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem700">snap-on safety bumper  700</span>  for use with existing prior art nail clippers. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem700">snap-on safety bumper  700</span>  forms a complete enclosure and is hollow along a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem702">curved center longitudinal length  702</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem702">curved center longitudinal length  702</span>  corresponds with a cross-sectional view of a blade portion of a prior-art type of nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem700">snap-on safety bumper  700</span>  preferably includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem704">slit  704</span>  so it can be opened and easily inserted around one or both of the blades of the prior-art type of nail clipper. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem706">latch  706</span>  is provided at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem704">slit  704</span>  to retain the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem700">snap-on safety bumper  700</span>  in a closed position, after installation. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem706">latch  706</span>  can include a spherical protrusion on one side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem704">slit  704</span>  that engages with and is retained by a spherical opening on an opposite side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem704">slit  704</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is to be understood that numerous variations in the shape, placement and configuration of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivoting lever  26</span>  are, of course, possible and each configuration provides a means for urging the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">second cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  toward each other. However, the means for urging the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">second cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  toward each other for all embodiments of the instant invention apply a first downward force to a portion (i.e., to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">top planar surface  9</span>   a ) of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span> , or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first blade portion  18</span>   b , urging the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span> , or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first blade portion  18</span>   b  in a first downward direction toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  or toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second blade portion  20</span>   b  while simultaneously applying a second upward force to a portion (i.e., to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">bottom planar surface  7</span>   a ) of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second blade portion  20</span>   b , urging the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade portion  20</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">modified second blade portion  20</span>   b  in a second upward direction toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first blade portion  18</span>  or toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">modified first blade portion  18</span>   b , and wherein the second direction is opposite with respect to the first direction.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In this manner, the first and second forces are applied directly to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">blades  18</span> ,  18   b ,  20 ,  20   b  and not to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">plastic frame  12</span> ,  102 ,  202 . As previously described, this greatly reduces the magnitude of stress and strain that is experienced by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">plastic frame  12</span> ,  102 ,  202 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">plastic frame  12</span> ,  102 ,  202  maintains the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">second cutting edges  19</span>   a ,  21   a  of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  or the modified first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span>   b ,  20   b  in a proper parallel alignment with respect to each other when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  100 ,  200 ,  300  is disposed in an open position and while the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  or the modified first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span>   b ,  20   b  are urged toward each other, and also when the cutting action is complete and the length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">first cutting edge  19</span>   a  abuts (i.e., is in contact with) the length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second cutting edge  21</span>   a , at which time the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  100 ,  200 ,  300  is disposed in a second, closed position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, a lightweight, inexpensive, and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">attractive nail clipper  10</span> ,  100 ,  200 ,  300  that has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">plastic frame  12</span> ,  102 ,  202  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">steel blades  18</span> ,  18   b ,  20 ,  20   b  is provided that can easily cut through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">toughest fingernails  310</span>  and toenails. It is also possible to use materials other than plastic for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> ,  102 ,  202  and it is also possible to use materials other than steel for the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  or the modified first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span>   b ,  20   b  without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, a ceramic material may be used for the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span> ,  20  or the modified first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span>   b ,  20   b , however the first and second forces would still be applied directly to the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blades  18</span> ,  20  or to the modified first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second blade portions  18</span>   b ,  20   b , respectively, and not directly to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> ,  102 ,  202 , regardless of the material that is used to form the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> ,  102 ,  202 . Similarly, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> ,  102 ,  202  could be formed of any desired material that provides sufficient flexibility, such as certain types of carbon fiber or other synthetic materials.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      There are numerous ways of urging the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower halves  12</span>   a ,  12   b ,  102   a ,  102   b , and  202   a ,  202   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">plastic frame  12</span> ,  102 ,  202  apart into the open position. The hysteresis that is inherent with the material used to form the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame  12</span> ,  102 ,  202  supplies a force that is useful in urging the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower halves  12</span>   a ,  12   b ,  102   a ,  102   b , and  202   a ,  202   b  into the open position. The additional amount of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">plastic material  16</span> , if included, also supplies a force that is useful in urging the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower halves  12</span>   a ,  12   b ,  102   a ,  102   b , and  202   a ,  202   b  into the open position.
