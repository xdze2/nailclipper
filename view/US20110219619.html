                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0002]    The present invention relates to nail clippers, and more particularly, to nail clippers that cut fingernails by means of a transverse shearing force, thereby safely protecting the fingernails and fingers and performing the fingernail cutting operation with a single action.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    2. Background of the Related Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    Conventional nail clippers are structured to insert a fingernail between blades of a cutter in such a manner as to cut the fingernail by means of the pressing force generated by pressing the cutter.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]      FIG. 1  is a side view showing a general configuration of conventional nail clippers. As shown, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">conventional nail clippers  10</span>  are made by coupling a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">body  12</span>  made of an elastic steel plate and having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">cutter  11</span>  formed at one end thereof by means of press machining with an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">operating lever  13</span>  adapted to transmit a pressing force by using the principle of the lever.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">cutter  11</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">conventional nail clippers  10</span>  is generally crescent-shaped, as shown in the dotted circle of  FIG. 1 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">cutter  11</span>  is located at the end portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">body  12</span>  in such a manner as to be opened to insert a fingernail thereinto by means of the elasticity of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">body  12</span>  if the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">body  12</span>  is not pressed by the application of an external force thereto. The upper and lower blades of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">cutter  11</span>  have a vertically facing symmetrical structure to correspond with each other, and when the pressing force is applied from the outside to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">cutter  11</span> , they are brought into direct contact with each other to generate a shearing force therefrom.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">operating lever  13</span>  is shaft-coupled to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">body  12</span>  by means of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">pin  14</span>  and has a protrusion formed at the end portion thereof so as to press the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">cutter  11</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">body  12</span>  thereagainst and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">nail file plate  15</span>  formed at the inside thereof so as to sharpen or file the fingernail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    On the other hand, there have been proposed nail clippers that are improved to solve the inconveniences in use and to develop the performances of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">general nail clippers  10</span> , but they just keep the basic structure formed by the cooperative operation relation between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">cutter  11</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">body  12</span>  as mentioned above.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    Since the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">operating lever  12</span>  is pressed to generate the shearing force, further, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">conventional nail clippers  10</span>  are hard and inconvenient to use and have the following problems.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    First, as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">operating lever  12</span>  should be pressed, it is hard to use the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clippers  10</span> , and if misused, the fingernail may cut too deeply, which is not safe in use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    Since the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clippers  10</span>  are operated in the state where the portion of the fingernail to be sheared is roughly expected, secondly, it is hard to accurately adjust the length of the fingernail to be sheared.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    As the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">operating lever  13</span>  should be firmly pressed, thirdly, it is very hard for kids and children to use it.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]    Fourthly, the fingernail is cut in such a way as to correspond with the shape of the finger, and therefore, even though the shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">cutter  11</span>  is formed to correspond with the shape of the finger, the fingernail is not cut to a round shape at a time, thereby performing the cutting operation repeatedly.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0014]    Since the fingernails after the cutting spring toward the outside, lastly, they should be collected again and thrown away.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>

                        <p>          [0046]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">upper case  24</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">lower case  25</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">body  21</span>  have <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">heads  23</span>  each having a groove, and when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">upper case  24</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">lower case  25</span>  are coupled to each other, the grooves of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">heads  23</span>  form the fingernail insertion part  22 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0047]    At the inside of the fingernail insertion part  22  formed by coupling the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">upper case  24</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">lower case  25</span>  to each other, is provided a cutter fixing part  26  adapted to supportingly fix the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutter  30</span>  thereto. In the structure of coupling the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutter  30</span>  and the cutter fixing part  26 , if the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutter  30</span>  is detachably mountable, that is, if the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutter  30</span>  and the cutter fixing part  26  are insertedly fixed to each other, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutter  30</span>  is exchangeable.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0048]    The fingernail insertion part  22  serves to induce the fingernail into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">body  21</span> , and desirably, the fingernail insertion part  22  has a shape capable of easily inserting the end portion of the fingernail thereinto. For example, the fingernail insertion part  22  has a round shape corresponding to the shape of the fingernail (which is shown in  FIG. 4   b ). However, the fingernail insertion part  22  may have a horizontal shape into which the fingernail is insertable (which is shown in  FIG. 4   a ). In this case, the height of the fingernail insertion part  22  is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> desirably within about 5</span> mm a little larger than the thickness of the fingernail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0049]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">heads  23</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">body  21</span>  on which the fingernail insertion part  22  is formed may have various shapes capable of being naturally brought into contact with the front end portion of the finger, as shown in  FIGS. 5   a  to  5   c . So as to induce the contact of the finger with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">heads  23</span> , for example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">heads  23</span>  have an outside rounded shape on the front end surfaces thereof (which is shown in  FIG. 5   a ), a horizontal plane shape on the front end surfaces thereof (which is shown in  FIG. 5   b ), or an inside rounded shape on the front end surfaces thereof (which is shown in  FIG. 5   c ).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0050]    On the other hand, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">fingernail discharging hole  29</span>  is formed near the position where the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutter  30</span>  is located on the side surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">body  21</span>  and serves to discharge the fingernail cut by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutter  30</span>  to the outside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">body  21</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">fingernail discharging hole  29</span>  is formed on one side surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">body  21</span> , and otherwise, it is formed on both side surfaces of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">body  21</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0051]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutter  30</span>  is selected from a variety of shapes as shown in  FIGS. 6   a  to  8   c  and is fixedly mounted at the inside of the fingernail insertion part  22  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">body  21</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutter  30</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">fixed plate  31</span>  fixed supportedly to a cutter fixing part  26 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutter  30</span>  is selected from a single cutter having the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">single fixed plate  31</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">blade face  33</span>  formed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">single fixed plate  31</span> , as shown in  FIGS. 6   a  to  7   c , and a double cutter having the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">fixed plates  31</span>  disposed opposite to each other and upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">lower side blade faces  33</span>  formed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">fixed plates  31</span> , as shown in  FIGS. 8   a  to  8   c .  FIGS. 6   a  to  6   c  show the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">single cutters  30</span> , wherein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">blade face  33</span>  is formed on one side surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">fixed plate  31</span> , and  FIGS. 7   a  to  7   c  show another type of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">single cutters  30</span> , wherein a portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">fixed plate  31</span>  is incised to form a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutter blade portion  34</span>  having <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">blade faces  33</span>  adapted to cut the fingernail inserted into a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">gap  32</span>  formed by the incision on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">fixed plate  31</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0052]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">blade face  33</span>  has a shape of a straight line or a curved line. In case of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">blade face  33</span>  of the straight line, it is desirably formed within a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> range between 5</span>Â° to 175Â° and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem185"> between 185</span>Â° to 355Â°.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0053]      FIGS. 9   a  and  9   b  are sectional views showing examples of the mounting of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutter  30</span>  having the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">single fixed plate  31</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0054]    As shown in  FIGS. 10   a  and  10   b , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutter  30</span>  is mounted at any one side with respect to the fingernail insertion part  22 , and as shown in  FIG. 10   c , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutter  30</span>  is mounted symmetrically or asymmetrically at both sides with respect to the fingernail insertion part  22 . Otherwise, as shown in  FIGS. 11   a  to  11   c , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">two cutters  30</span>  are mounted at the upper and lower sides with respect to the fingernail insertion part  22 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0055]    On the other hand, as shown in  FIGS. 14 to 16 , there are proposed nail clippers according to a second embodiment of the present invention, wherein the nail clippers are provided with a fingernail insertion and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">depth adjusting guide  56</span>  adapted to induce the contact with the front end of the finger. The fingernail insertion and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">depth adjusting guide  56</span>  is protruded forwardly from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">head  23</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">lower case  25</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">body  21</span>  toward the front side of the fingernail insertion part  22  in such a manner as to have a shape corresponding with the shape of the fingernail insertion part  22 , thereby guiding the insertion of the fingernail into the fingernail insertion part  22  and adjusting the depth of the fingernail inserted into the fingernail insertion part  22 . Desirably, the fingernail insertion and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">depth adjusting guide  56</span>  is formed as a unitary body with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">head  23</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">lower case  25</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">body  21</span> . Further, the nail clippers according to the second embodiment of the present invention is provided with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">a direction indication protruding guide  57</span>  adapted to allow the initial position and direction of the fingernail to be cut to be easily recognized. Th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">e direction indication protruding guide  57</span>  is protruded forwardly from one end of the fingernail insertion and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">depth adjusting guide  56</span>  toward the front side of the fingernail insertion part  22 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0056]    Now, an explanation on an operating method of the nail clippers according to the present invention will be given.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0057]    As shown in  FIGS. 12 ,  13  and  16 , the finger abuts against the fingernail insertion part  22  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">nail clippers  20</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">fingernail  54</span>  is inserted into the fingernail insertion part  22 . In this state, if a pushing force is applied to any direction, that is, to a direction A in  FIG. 12  and directions A 1  and A 2  in  FIG. 13 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">fingernail  54</span>  inserted into the fingernail insertion part  22  is cut by means of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">blade face  33</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutter  30</span>  mounted at the inside of the fingernail insertion part  22 , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">cut fingernail  54</span>  is discharged through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">fingernail discharging hole  29</span> , without any movement to the interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">body  21</span>  by means of the formation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">partition  29</span>   a.     </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0058]    Unlike the conventional nail clippers wherein the fingernail is cut by means of the shearing force generated by pressing the cutter, the nail clippers according to the present invention cuts the fingernail in safe and easy manners at a time just by inserting the fingernail into the fingernail insertion part  22  and moving the finger or the nail clippers in one direction.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0059]    Furthermore, the front end of the finger is brought into contact with the fingernail insertion and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">depth adjusting guide  56</span>  protruded forwardly from the front side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">head  23</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">lower case  25</span> , such that the finger does not abut against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutter  30</span> , thereby ensuring the safe use of the nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0060]    Also, the fingernail is easily inserted into the fingernail insertion part  22 , thereby allowing the kids and children to easily use the nail clippers, and the depth of the fingernail inserted into the fingernail insertion part  22  is checked, thereby adjusting the length of the fingernail to be cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0061]    Additionally, when the fingernail is pushed and cut, since the cutting angle is not constantly defined in conventional practices, a user does not know that the fingernail should be cut at any angle, such that the fingernail is cut with the sense of the touch. However, according to the present invention, the end of the fingernail slightly abuts against th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">e direction indication protruding guide  57</span>  and the finger is not separated from th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">e direction indication protruding guide  57</span>  until the fingernail is completely cut, thereby easily cutting the fingernail. Accordingly, the position of a direction where the fingernail is pushed and cut is recognized in advance by the user by means of the formation of the fingernail insertion and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">depth adjusting guide  56</span>  and th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">e direction indication protruding guide  57</span> , such that the user can obtain the depth of the insertion of the fingernail and the position of the pushing and cutting direction of the fingernail with the sense of the touch of the front end of the finger with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">guides  56</span>  and  57 . Thus, the initial position at which the fingernail is pushed is accurately found, and the fingernail is cut. Also, the depth of the fingernail inserted into the fingernail insertion part  22  is maintained constantly, such that the fingernail is not cut larger or smaller than a desired cutting length.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0062]    As described above, there are provided the nail clippers according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention that are capable of being safely used without any damage on the fingernail and the finger upon cutting and of rapidly completing the fingernail cutting with a single cutting action, thereby providing easy and simple usage to everyone.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0063]    In addition, the nail clippers of the present invention are capable of easily collecting the fingernails cut through the fingernail discharging hole, thereby removing inconveniences of the collection of the fingernails one by one after cutting.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0064]    While the present invention has been described with reference to the particular illustrative embodiments, it is not to be restricted by the embodiments but only by the appended claims. It is to be appreciated that those skilled in the art can change or modify the embodiments without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. </p>
