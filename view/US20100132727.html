                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A nail clipper configuration accommodates permanent three dimensional covers on the front of the nail clipper by limiting the necessary movement of the operating handle to move from the stored position to the operating position. </p>

                        <p> PRIORITY INFORMATION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    The present invention claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/200,326 filed on Nov. 28, 2008, making reference to same in its entirety and incorporating same herein.  </p>
                    
                        <p>       </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIELD OF INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    The present invention relates generally to nail clippers, such as those that are provided with an operating handle for applying pressure to bring together a pair of cutting edges. More particularly, the present invention is directed to nail clippers in which the operating handle is configured to accommodate a decorative three-dimensional cover arranged on the front of the nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0003]    The type of nail clipper to which the present invention is directed generally includes a body having an upper flexible member and a lower flexible member, connected at one end thereof, and having cutting edges at the opposite end. The cutting edges are configured to be brought together under pressure. The operating handle is connected to a holding pin adjacent the cutting edges. The holding pin is configured to keep the two, preferably flat, flexible members a predetermined distance apart. The holding pin is also used to anchor the operating handle so that pressure can be applied, forcing the upper flexible member against the lower flexible member, with the holding pin providing an anchor for the fulcrum that is applied to the upper flexible member by the operating handle.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    The operating handle is the key to the entire configuration. In a stored position, it lies flat along the upper spring providing a slim configuration. This position of the operating handle also permits it to be accessed easily to move the entire apparatus into an operating configuration.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    Conventional nail clippers of this type require that the operating handle be lifted and rotated about. It is normal for the operating handle to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180"> be rotated approximately 180</span>Â° and then rotated around so that the top of the handle faces in a direction opposite that occupied in the stored position. A structure on the bottom of the handle serves as a pressure point and a fulcrum so that when the handle is pressed down, part of it is held by the holding pin and the upper flexible member acts as a spring when it is pressed down toward the second flexible member. This develops sufficient force so that a cutting operation can take place using the blades at the ends of the flat spring-like structures.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    While the action of moving the operating handle from the stored position to the operating position is rather awkward, this does not constitute a problem in most conventional nail clippers. However, there are drawbacks in certain situations. For example, usually two hands are needed to move the handle from the stored position to the operational position. Additional space is also needed for this operation. If one-handed use is required, or a constricted area is imposed upon the user, then the use of such conventional nail clippers becomes problematic at best.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    Conventional nail clippers are so common that they are very often used in merchandising and advertising. Normally this is done by simply placing text, trademarks, images and the like on the various flat surfaces of the nail clipper. This is an easy process, and admits readily to mass distribution for advertising purposes.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    However, not all advertising and merchandising can be carried out using plane surfaces. A substantial amount of merchandising is carried out using three dimensional models and images. For example, logos in the form of three dimensional depictions of mascots (such as those for schools, corporations and the like) are very common. Because of the wide-spread use of conventional nail clippers with mass advertising and merchandising, the marketing and merchandising of various images with conventional nail clippers would appear to be a natural combination. However, such a combination is impractical with conventional nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    Generally, any three dimensional structure that is fit onto the nail clipper is forced off or damaged when moving the nail clipper handle for the stored position to the operating position. Consequently, the marketing of three dimensional covers or images is impractical with conventional nail clippers. This drawback is true of all the conventional nail clippers considered. These include the arrangements of: U.S. Pat. No. 6,941,657 to Choi, et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,941,658 to Park; U.S. Pat. No. 6,904,683 to Shinoda, et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,449 to Lee, et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 7,020,964 to Han, et al. All of these patents are incorporated herein by reference.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    Improvements upon these designs, as well as all of the others in the conventional art directed to nail clippers would include nail clippers that could be used with three dimensional decorative covers. Such decorative covers could remain on the nail clippers at all time, and would not have to be removed or suffer damage when moving the nail clipper operating handle back and forth from the stored position to the operating position. Such improved nail clippers would readily admit to easy marketing in conjunction with three dimensional images or designs.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0011]    Accordingly, it is a principle object of the present invention to overcome the drawbacks of conventional nail clippers, especially with respect to mounting three dimensional decorative covers on the nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    It is another object of the present invention to provide nail clippers having simplified operation when moving the operating handle back and forth from the stored position to the operating position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]    It is a further object of the present invention to provide nail clippers that take up less space than conventional nail clippers when moving the handle from the stored position to the operating position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0014]    It is an additional object of the present invention to provide nail clippers that can accommodate a wide variety of three dimensional decorative covers, without necessitating removal of those covers or damage to those covers when moving the operating handle back and forth from the stored position to the operating position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0015]    It is still another object of the present invention to provide an arrangement of a nail clipper and a decorative cover wherein the cover is arranged to facilitate the function of the nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0016]    It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a combination of nail clippers and three dimensional cover, wherein the cover expresses the function of the nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0017]    These and other goals and objects of the present invention are achieved by a nail clipper configuration arranged to accommodate a three dimensional cover for a nail clipper having two flexible members, each joined at a first end and each having opposed transverse blades at a second end. The flexible members are attached to a holding pin adjacent to the transverse blades, and the nail clipper has a handle operatively connected to the holding pin. The nail clipper further includes a pivot structure at one end of the handle and a bearing structure containing the pivot structure in both the operating position and the stored position for the handle. A locking mechanism is arranged so that the handle is moved from the stored position to the operating position solely by moving the pivot structure up and down within the bearing structure.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0021]      FIG. 1  is a side view with a slight perspective depicting the present invention with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">operating handle  5</span>  in the stored position. The basic nail clipper structure has a number of parts that are very similar or virtually the same to those conventional nail clippers. In particular, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">upper flexible member  2</span>  is connected at one end to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">lower flexible member  3</span> . Preferably, both of the flexible members are flat, as is common with conventional nail clippers. The nature of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">material constituting flexible members  2</span>  and  3  (metal or appropriate plastic), as well as the connection between them at one end, constitutes an assembled structure that operates in a spring-like manner. As a result, when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">flexible members  2</span> ,  3  are forced together, they will spring apart once the force is removed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]    Opposite the connection between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">flexible members  2</span> ,  3 , each flexible member has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">transverse blade  21</span> ,  31  respectively. The two flexible members are held at a predetermined distance apart by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">holding pin  4</span> . Part of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">pin  4</span>  is the lower connecting part  42  which securely connects to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">lower flexible member  3</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">Holding pin  4</span>  also includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">upper holding cap  41</span>  that fits over <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">flexible member  2</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">Upper holding cap  <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">41</span>  also holds bearing structure  6</span>  to the top of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">flexible member  2</span> . The use of this additional element is a substantial departure from conventional nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]    A major distinction over the conventional art resides in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">bearing structure  6</span>  and the use of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">pivot structure  52</span>  at the end of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">operating handle  5</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">pivot structure  52</span>  is held loosely in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">bearing structure  6</span>  so that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle  5</span>  <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">can lie against upper flexible member  2</span>  (as depicted in  FIG. 1 ), or can be lifted, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">thereby moving pivot structure  52</span>  downward into the operating position (as depicted in  FIG. 2 ). This is a crucial difference with the present invention, permitting a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">decorative three dimensional cover  100</span>  to be applied over the front of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail clipper  1</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">decorative cover  100</span>  can be app<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">lied permanently since operating handle  5</span>  does not interfere with it during the shift between operating or storage positions.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    When the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle  5</span>  is used to operate the nail clippers, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">forcing down flexible member  2</span>  to bring together the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">two transverse blades  21</span> ,  31 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">pivot structure  51</span>  is m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">oved downwards within bearing structure  6</span> . This <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">allows locking pin or protrusion  53</span>  t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">o be inserted into locking pin aperture  61</span> , thereby rigidly locking the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle  5</span>  into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">bearing structure  6</span> . Movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle  5</span> , within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">bearing structure  6</span> , is facilitated by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">release aperture  62</span>  which permits an arc of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">movement for handle  5</span> , thus, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">pivot structure  51</span>  is both rotated and shifted vertically within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">bearing structure  6</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]    Once handle  5</span>  is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">locked into bearing structure  6</span>  (by means of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">locking pin  53</span> ), <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle  5</span>  can be moved downwards in the normal cutting motion used with this type of nail clipper. As this is done, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">fulcrum piece  51</span>  slides along the outside of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">bearing<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">  6</span>  until fulcrum<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> piece  51</span>  reaches indentation  22</span>  in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">flexible member  2</span> . Once this occurs, further pressure on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> 5</span>  forces flexible m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">ember  2</span>  toward flexible member  3</span>  so that a cutting action can be effected by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">transverse blades  21</span> ,  31 . The fulcrum action of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">fulcrum piece  51</span>  when force is exerted on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle  5</span>  is facilitated by the structure of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">bearing piece  6</span>  being permanently connected to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">upper holding cap  41</span> , so that all force is transm<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">itted into moving upper flexible member  <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">2</span>  towards lower flexible member  3</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]    When the cutting operations are finished, the natural spring action of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">bearing piece  6</span>  (as well as <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">flexible members  2</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> 3 ) brings handle  5</span>  up to the position depicted in  FIG. 2 . Then, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle  5</span>  need only be pulled upwards a slight amount to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">release locking pin or protrusion  53</span>  from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">locking pin aperture  61</span> . At which point, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle  5</span>  can be placed back into the stored position depicted in  FIG. 1 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]    This limited range of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">movement for handle  5</span>  to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">operate nail clipper  1</span>  is significant because it permits a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">three dimensional cover  100</span>  (usually a decorative cover) to be placed as depicted on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail clipper  1</span>  without interfering with the operation of the nail clipper. It should be noted that conventional nail clippers require that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle  5</span>  be rotated about in order to moved from the stored position to the operating position. Such movement would force removal or destruction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">three dimensional cover  100</span> . This detriment is avoided by the configuration and operation of the present invention depicted in  FIGS. 1-3 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]    Further, the decorative cover can easily be configured to have an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">aperture  101</span>  (as depicted in  FIGS. 2 and 3 ) through which the operation of the nail clippers can be effected without disturbing the decorative cover, or limiting the function of the nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0029]    As a result, decorative three dimensional covers can be placed permanently on nail clippers configured according to the present invention. As such, this type of nail clipper can be used extensively for promotional projects, advertising, or merchandising of logos, mascots, celebrities, and the like. The present invention provides the operation of a conventional nail clipper while still permitting the addition of permanent covers that can be used in advertising or promotion, or even sold for their own sake.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0030]    While at least one preferred embodiment has been described by way of example, the present invention is not limited thereto. Rather, the present invention should be interpreted to encompass all variations, modifications, permutations, derivations, and embodiments that would occur to one skilled in this technology having possession of the teachings of the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention should be construed as being limited only by the following claims. </p>
