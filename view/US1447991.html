                        <p>   ticularly when the blades are of a character in which the cutting edges are made to meet instead of passing each other, as they do in the ordinary form of scissors, difliculty has been experienced in grinding these cutting edges where the tool has been arranged so that in its normal operation the cutting edges have a limited amount of opening between them. It is one of the objects of my invention to provide an arrangement by which these cutting edges may be ground when the cutting blades are assembled, but when they are widely spaced apart beyond the normal amount of opening which is allowable during the operation of the tool.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   With this and other objects in view, my invention consists of certain novel features of construction combination and arrange ment of parts as will be more fully described and pointed out in the appended claims.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the drawings, Figure 1 is a side elevation of one form of cutting tool to which my present invention has been applied;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> Fig ure 2</span> is a vertical sectional elevation through the pivot of the shears with some of the parts removed. Similar reference characters indicate similar parts in the several views.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   For purpose of illustration of my present invention I have chosen a pair of scissors or shears, such as are used in manicuring, in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">   </p>
                    
                        <p>  whi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">ch two members 10 and 11</span></span> are pivotedon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> screw 16</span>, these two members being provided respectively with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> portions 14 and 15</span></span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">g edges 12 and 13</span></span>. Between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> portions 14 and 15</span></span>, in the form illustrated, is placed a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> spring 23</span> of a well-known form, having its ends resting in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> openin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">gs 21, 22</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> member<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">s 11 and 10</span></span>.   </p>

                        <p>  sive amount of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> opening would be greater 1</span> than would be desirable in the normal use of thetool, because the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem141"> spaceb<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">etweenthe handles 141 and 15</span></span> wouldthen be too widefor Q the palm of the operators hand, and, fur   </p>

                        <p>  therefore, to arrange the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> shoulder 17</span> in such a way that the opening would be much less than this in extent.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  v &#39;l v itl the arrangement heretofore used,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  however, difiicultyis experienced in grinding the edges l2&#39;and 13 which, particularly in the type of tool illustrated, must be ground so that when these two edges meet there will be an exact alin&#39;ementbetween them throughout their length. The amount of opening between these blades, shown in full lines in. Figure 1, is all that is necessary&#34; or desirable in the normal operation of&#39;the tool. With this amountof opening, hoW&#39;- ever, dii&#39;iiculty is experienced in passing a grinding wheel-between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutting edges 12</span> and .13 so that both edges will not&#39;be. i   </p>

                        <p>  In order tooverconie this difficulty I pro vide a removable stop, such as the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> screw 18</span>, which isprovided with a taper thread engaging a tapered thread in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> member 10</span> i and having a plain rounded end so thatwhen the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> screw 18</span> is in place, its smooth end will engage in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> slot 19</span> in the surface of thejoint portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> member 11</span>. The engagement between the side of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> thescrew 18</span> and the end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> slot 19</span> will form a stop to limit the outward motion of the.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> handles Hand 15</span> and correspondingly, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">g edges 12</span> i 16</span>, which may with my device be made a permanent joint. by riveting, if so desired;   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Then, with. the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> screw 18</span> out of place the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> blades<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> 12 and 13</span></span> are<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> open until 13</span> occupies the dotted line position of Figure 1, when thetwo edges may be ground, and tried against each other until-they are in exact alinement. Then, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> spring 23</span> is inserted.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  betweenthe handles which are broughtto the full line position of Figure &#34;1, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> screw 18</span> put into place with its endv engaging the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> slot 19</span>. &#39;The opening of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">g v i edges 12, 13</span></span> is now limited to the amount shown in Figure 1, but at any time in re sharpening the blades the amount of opening may be increased by unscrewing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> screw 18</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   While I have illustrated a simple screw passing from the face of one of the members l0 into a slot in the face o&#39;r&#39; the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> other member 11</span>, it willhe obvious tl at any form of removable stop may be used in carrying out my invention. i Vhile I have shown my invention applied to a specific form of cutting tool, it will be obvious that it may be applied to any form, and particularly such tools as require cutting edges which exactly meet I claim:   </p>
