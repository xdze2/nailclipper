                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A novel nail clipper equipped with a light source is comprised of including but not limited to, two elongated spring arms, a biasing lever, a pivot pin, a light source, an on/off switch and a battery. The two spring arms are rigidly secured at one end and diverge at the other end. Two cutting edges are developed at the ends. The spring arms are pressed together in opposition to their inherent resilient force by a downward pressure on the lever. Upon the downward pressure applied by lever, cutting edges cooperatively engage to clip the nail. The biasing lever is pivoted at one end, to the pin extending through the aligned openings formed by the spring arms and is rotatably mounted so that the lever may be turned 180 degrees and is then put in its stored position for compactness. The light source is installed, including but not limited to, between the two spring arms, on the surface of the biasing lever, on the front surface of upper spring arm and in the pivot pin. The novel light source equipped nail clipper of this invention enables a safe nail cutting as well as picking out small pieces of glass, metal chips and a thorn of wood stuck in the skin all in a dark environment. </p>

                        <p>          SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    It is the purpose of this invention to provide a novel nail clipper for safe nail cutting and picking out small pieces of metal and of wood stuck in a skin, all in a dark environment. The nail clipper of this invention is comprised of, including but not limited to, two elongated spring arms, a biasing lever, a pivot pin, a light source, an on/off switch and a battery. The two spring arms are rigidly secured at one end and diverge at the other end. Two cutting edges are developed at these ends. The spring arms are pressed together in opposition to their inherent resilient force by a downward pressure on lever. Upon the downward pressure applied by the lever, cutting edges cooperatively engage to clip the nail. The biasing lever is pivoted at one end, to the pin extending through aligned openings formed in spring arms and is rotatably mounted so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180"> lever may be turned 180</span> degrees and put in its stored position for compactness. The light bulb is installed, including but not limited to, between the two spring arms, on the surface of the biasing lever, in the pivot pin and on the front surface of the upper spring arm.  </p>
