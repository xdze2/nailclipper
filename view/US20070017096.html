                        <p> I. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]     A. Field of Invention   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0002]     This invention pertains to the art of methods and apparatuses for cutting devices and, more specifically to a toenail clipper.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]     B. Brief History   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]     The conventional toenail clipper contains a lever arm secured to the body of the clipper by a central peg. Typically, the peg is anchored to the base of the clipper. The lever arm may include an angled portion, usually triangular or elliptical in shape that protrudes from the lever arm. This angled portion creates a fixed point that gives the clipper its leverage. The upper and lower clipper bodies are connected at one end and open at the other end, with each having sharpened edges at the opened end. Cutting is commenced by depressing the lever arm using the angled portion of the lever arm as leverage. As this motion starts, the angled portion of the clipper pushes the clipper body down. Since the blades are held together at their tips by the peg, the top blade is allowed to move down along the peg as it is compressed by the work of the lever arm. As such, the upper blade moves down until it contacts the bottom blade, thus cutting a fingernail or toenail that is placed between them.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]     This conventional nail clipper design is typically not well suited for cutting thickened toenails. The user often has to put an extra amount of effort into cutting these nails with the conventional nail clippers, and at times does not succeed. The simple leverage system of the existing clipper does not create enough force to easily cut the nail. Therefore, it would be beneficial to have a nail clipper that reduces the amount of force needed to cut thickened toenails. Additionally, it would be helpful to have a nail clipper that minimizes the slip occurring at the lever arm during the toenail cutting process. The subject invention solves the aforementioned problem.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        II. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0006]     One aspect of the subject invention includes a cutting clipper that includes a first cutting member having first and seconds ends, the first cutting member having a cutting edge at the first end of the first cutting member; a second cutting member having first and second ends, the second cutting member having a cutting edge at the first end of the second cutting member, wherein the second end of the first cutting member is fixedly connected to the second end of the second cutting member; a cam fixedly connected to the first cutting member; and, a lever arm pivotally connected with respect to the second cutting member for use in engaging the cam to juxtapose the cutting edge of the first cutting member to the cutting edge of the second cutting member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]     Another aspect of the subject invention includes a cutting clipper wherein the first end of the first cutting member is selectively moveable with respect to the first end of the second member between a first spaced apart position and a second juxtaposed position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]     Yet another aspect of the subject invention includes a cutting clipper wherein the lever arm includes a first lever arm portion and a second lever arm portion, the second lever arm portion extending from the first lever arm portion at an angle, and, further including a roller member rotatably connected with respect to the lever arm, the roller member connected between the lever arm and the cam.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]     Still yet another aspect of the subject invention includes a cutting clipper wherein the first lever arm member has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> length L 1</span> , wherein the second lever arm member has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> length L 2</span> , and,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> wherein L 2</span>  is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> longer than L 1</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]     Even yet another aspect of the subject invention includes a cutting clipper wherein the ratio of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> L 2</s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">pan> /L<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> 1</span>  ranges from 1</span>.5 to 4.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]     Yet another aspect of the subject invention includes a cutting clipper wherein the roller member is rotatably connected with respect to the second lever arm portion, and, further including a handle pivotally connected with respect to the second cutting member, the handle being rotatably connected with respect to the first lever arm portion.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]     Still another aspect of the subject invention includes a cutting clipper having first and second gripping pads, the first gripping pad affixed to the second cutting member, the second gripping pad affixed to the handle.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]     Yet another aspect of the subject invention includes a cutting clipper having at least a first post rigidly extended from the second cutting member, and, wherein the lever arm is pivotally connected to the at least a first post for use in engaging the cam to juxtapose the cutting edge of the first cutting member to the cutting edge of the second cutting member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0014]     Still another aspect of the subject invention includes a cutting clipper having at least a second post rigidly extended from the second cutting member, and, wherein the handle is pivotally connected to the at least a second post.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0015]     A toenail clipper is discussed herein that increases leverage and grip when cutting toenails. The toenail clipper is comprised of upper and lower members of the clipper body, a lever arm, four support members, and angled body, a roller, and a roller ramp. The upper and lower members of the clipper body may be connected at one end while the distal end has an open space containing the cutting edges. The lever arm may have two ends: one padded with a grip type surface, and the other affixed to the angled body by a pin, which creates a continuous hinge. The lever arm has a fixed point where it meets the support member creating a fixed hinge. This fixed point may be located anywhere on the lever arm, but in one embodiment has the fixed point near the continuous hinge. Both ends of the lever arm rotate around this fixed point. The four support members, two small and two large, may be appropriately positioned to create pivot points where the body is attached and rotates thereabout. The two smaller support members connect the lever arm to the clipper body creating a hinge. This hinge allows the end of the lever arm opposite the grip surface to rise upon the depression of the lever arm. The large support members may be positioned to create a pivot point for the angled body and secure the angled body to the clipper body. The angled body can include any angle between 0 degrees and 180 degrees. In one embodiment, the angle is 90 degrees. Support members may be affixed to the angled body at the point of intersection of its two sides. The first end of the angled body is affixed to the lever arm by a pin creating the fore mentioned continuous joint. The second end is affixed to the roller. The roller is secured on either end to the angled member and moves with the motion of the angled body. As the lever arm is depressed, the continuous hinge raises, causing the angled body to rotate around the fixed hinge. As the roller moves up the roller ramp, the sharpened opening of the clipper closes.  </p>

This allows the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">cutting members  3</span> ,  4  to be placed one on top of the other for assembly purposes as will be discussed further in the paragraphs below. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">first cutting member  3</span>  may be described as having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">top portion  6</span>  and first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">second ends  7</span> ,  8  respectively. In a similar manner, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">second cutting member  4</span>  may have <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">top portion  10</span>  and first and second ends shown at  12  and  13  respectively. The first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">second cutting members  3</span> ,  4  may further include <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">side portions  16</span>  from which support members extend as will be discussed further in a subsequent paragraph. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">clipper  1</span>  may include an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">upper cutting edge  21</span>  fashioned on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">first end  7</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">first cutting member  3</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">fixed lower cutting edge  24</span>  similarly fashioned on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first end  12</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">second cutting member  4</span> . As the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">first ends  7</span> ,  12  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">cutting members  3</span> ,  4  are brought together the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">cutting edges  21</span> ,  24  may be used to cut toenails, fingernails or any other item as is appropriate for the subject invention. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">cutting members  3</span> ,  4  may be constructed from a sufficiently hard material so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">cutting members  3</span> ,  4  may efficiently cut the items as desired. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">cutting members  3</span> ,  4  may be constructed a metal or other material as is appropriate for cutting the items described above. It is noted here that metal retains its shape if it is bent to a small degree. In other words, metal is elastically deformable.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]     With continued reference to  FIGS. 1 and 2 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">clippers  1</span>  may additionally include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">lever arm  27</span>  pivotally connected to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">posts or support members  32</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">support members  32</span>  may extend from a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">side  16</span>  of the second cutting member upward past the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">top portion  10</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">first cutting member  3</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">support members  32</span>  may be rigidly secured to the second cutting member for use in supporting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">lever arm  27</span>  as it moves during operations of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">clipper  1</span> . The distal end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">support members  32</span>  may include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">hole  35</span>  fashioned therein for use in receiving a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">pin  38</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">pin  38</span>  may be inserted through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">holes  35</span>  and through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">lever arm  27</span>  creating a pivot point about which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">lever arm  27</span>  moves. Any manner of connecting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">lever arm  27</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">pin  38</span>  for pivotal rotation to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">support members  32</span>  may be chosen with sound engineering. In one embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">lever arm  27</spa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">n>  may comprise two lever arm portions  27</span>   a ,  27   b . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">first arm portion  27</span>   a  may be configured at an angle A with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">second arm portion  27</span>   b . In this embodiment the angle A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90"> may be 90</span>Â°. However, the angle A may fall within the range of 0Â° to 180Â°. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">arm portions  27</span>   a ,  27   b  may also have different arm portion segment lengths. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">Arm portion  27</span>   a  may have a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> length L 1</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">arm portion  27</span>   b  may have a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> length L 2</span> . The ratio of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> L 2</s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">pan> /L 1</span>  may fall with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> range 1</span> to 8. More preferably, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> ratio <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">L 2</span> /L 1</span>  is with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> range 1</span>.5 to 4. However, any ratio of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> L 2</s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">pan> /L 1</span>  may be chosen with sound engineering judgment as is appropriate for use with the subject invention. It is noted here that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> longer arm portion L 2</span> , over<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> L 1</span> , provides increased leverage and torque that may used to cut thicker nails or harder substances more easily.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]     With continued reference to  FIGS. 1 and 2 , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">roller  42</span>  may rotatably connected to the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">leverage arm  27</span> . More specifically, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">roller  42</span>  may be connected to the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">arm portion  27</span>   a . Any manner of rotatably securing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">roller  42</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">leverage arm  27</span>  may be chosen with sound engineering judgment. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">leverage arm  27</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">roller  42</span>  may be positioned proximate to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">cam or cam member  45</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">cam member  45</span>  may be fixedly attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">top portion  6</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">cutting member  3</span> . In one embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">cam member  45</span>  may include a linear sloped cam surface designed to be in contact with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">roller  42</span> . Alternatively, the cam may be curved or include any configuration as is appropriate for use with the subject invention. In this manner, when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">leverage arm  27</span>  is pivoted the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">roller  42</span>  moves up the cam surface thereby creating a force that pushes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">first cutting member  3</span>  downward with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">second cutting member  4</span> . As the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">support arms  32</span>  are fixed to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">second cutting member  4</span> , force from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">pivoting leverage arm  27</span>  brings the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">cutting edge  21</span>  into a cutting relationship with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">cutting edge  24</span> . It is noted here that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">second ends  8</span> ,  13  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">cutting members  3</span> , may be fixedly connected together. More specifically, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">cutting members  3</span> ,  4  may be riveted together at their <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">respective ends  8</span> ,  13 . However, any manner of securing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">cutting members  3</span> ,  4  together may be chosen with sound engineering judgment. In the securing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">cutting members  3</span> ,  4  together, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">second ends  8</span> ,  13  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">cutting member  3</span> ,  4  may be juxtaposed to each other while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">first ends  7</span> ,  12  may be spaced apart so that item being cut may be placed in between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">cutting edges  21</span> ,  24 . In this way, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">cutting members  3</span> ,  4  may be elastically deformable so that when the force from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">leverage arm  27</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">cam  45</span>  force the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">first cutting member  3</span>  downward with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">second cutting member  4</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">first cutting  3</span>  member may spring back into its original spaced apart position when the force from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">leverage  27</span>  is released.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]     With continued reference to  FIGS. 1 and 2 , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">handle  48</span>  may be hingingly connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">leverage arm  27</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">handle  48</span>  may be pivotally connected a second set of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">support arms  51</span>  via a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">pin  55</span>  or other pivoting mechanism. One end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">handle  48</span>  may be rotatably connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">leverage arm  27</span>  at the distal end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">arm  27</span>  with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">roller  42</span> . The configuration of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">leverage arm  27</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">handle  48</span>  are constructed so that in the open position, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">handle  48</span>  is extended upward from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">top surface  6</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">first cutting member  3</span> . In this manner, when the operator depresses the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">handle  48</span>  against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">second cutting member  4</span> , force is applied through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">handle  48</span> , via the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">leverage arm  27</span>  and transferred to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">cutting edges  21</span> ,  24 . In certain circumstances, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">handle  48</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">top portion  10</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">second cutting member  4</span>  may become slippery before and/or during use. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">handle  48</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">second cutting member  4</span>  may therefore be covered with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">grippin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">g pads  59</span>  or gripping material  59</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">material  59</span>  may be secured to the surfaces via adhesives. However, any manner of securing the gripping material to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">handle  48</span>  and/or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">second cutting member  4</span>  may be chosen with sound engineering judgment. In one embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">gripping material  59</span>  may be a polymeric material. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">gripping material  59</span>  may be textured to allow for no-slip gripping action during use. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">gripping material  59</span>  may also be soft for easy gripping action during use. However, any type of gripping material may be chosen as is appropriate for use with the subject invention.   </p>
