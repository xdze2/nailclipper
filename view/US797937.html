                        <p>  To all whom it nuty concern;   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known th at LCHAPEL S. CARTER, a citizen of the United States, residing at Ansonia, in the county of New Haven and State of Connecticut, have invented a new and useful Improvement in Finger-Nail Trimmers; and I do hereby declare the following, when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings and the numerals of reference marked thereon, to be a full, clear, and exact description of the same, and which said drawings constitute part of this specification, and represent, in-   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 1, a plan view of a finger-nail trimmer constructed in accordance with my invention; Fig. 2, a view thereof, partly in side elevation and partly in longitudinal section and shown as closed; Fig. 3, a View thereof in side elevation, shown as open; Fig. 4, a reverse plan view thereof; Fig. 5, a detached view in inside elevation of the lever member provided with an integral locking-lug; Fig. 6, a corresponding view of the other lever member to which the locking-slide is applied; Fig. 7 a detached plan view of the lockingslide; Fig. 8, an edge view thereof; Fig. 9, a plan View of one of the modified forms which the device may assume; Fig. 10, a view thereof in longitudinal section; Fig. 11, a view in longitudinal section of another form which my improved device may assume; Fig. 12, a detached view, in inside elevation, of one of the two members of the device of Fig. 11; Fig. 13, a view in longitudinal section of still another form which my improved device may assume; Fig. 14:, a broken plan view of the handle end of one of the two members of the device of Fig. 13; Fig. 15, a detached plan view of the cam upon the locking-stud forming a feature of the device of Figs. 13 and 1 1.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My invention relates to an improvement in finger-nail trimmers of the plier type, the object being to produce at a low cost for manufacture a simple, compact, and efiective appliance constructed with particular reference to ease and convenience of operation and durability in use.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   With these ends in view my invention consists in a finger-nail trimmer of the plier type having certain details of construction and combinations of parts, as will be hereinafter described, and pointed out in the claims.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In carrying out my invention as shown in F1gs.l to 8, 1nclus1ve,of the drawings I employ<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> two st<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">ruck-up sheet-metal lever members 2 and 3</span></span>,flanged or cupped to increase their rigidity and having their cutting ends respectively formed with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> large <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">clearance-openings 4 and 5</span></span>, adapting one member to be passed through the other plierwise. The-said lever members are connected by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> pivot 6</span> passing through the said clearance-openings and located relatively near the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> integr<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">al cutters 7 and 8</span></span>, which are concaved to conform to the curvature of the finger-nails. For holding the lever members together against the tension of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> spring 9</span>, which constantly tends to throw them apart, I provide the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> member 2</span>, at the center of its handle end, with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> an integral inwardly-turned locking-lug 10</span>, adapted to be engaged by the end of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> pointed nail-cleaner 11</span>,inwardly off set from the outer end of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> locking-slide 12</span>, located within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> lever member 3</span> and sliding back and forth under a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> bridge or staple 13</span>, located within the same. The inner end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> slide 12</span> is bowed to form a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> frictionspring 14</span>:, which restrains its endwise movement and holds it in place. The slide is operated by means of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> button 15</span>, located upon the outer face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> lever member 3</span> and having its shank passed through a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> slot 16</span> therein and into the slide, to which it is thus secured.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   After the user of the device has finished using it he will close the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lever <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">members 2 and 3</span></span> against the tension of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> spring 9</span> and use the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> button 15</span> for shoving the slide outward, so as to engage the point of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> nail-cleaner 11</span> with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> locking-lug 10</span>, as shown in Fig. 2. On the other hand, if he desires to use the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> nail-cleaner 11</span> the same is disengaged from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> lug 10</span> by shoving the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> button 15</span> inward and allowing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> spring 9</span> to separate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lever <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">members 2 and 3</span></span>, after which the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> slide 12</span> is again shoved outward by its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> button 13</span>, whereby its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> nail-cleaner 11</span> will be projected beyond the rounded handle end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> lever member 3</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> spring 9</span> aforesaid is mounted in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lever member 2</span>, to which it is secured by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> rivet 17</span>; but the form and arrangement of this spring may obviously be varied.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  As shown in Fig. 4, the outer face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lever member 2</span> is roughened, as at 18, to serve as a file.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the modified construction shown by Figs. 9 and 10 of the drawings the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lever <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">members 2 and 3</span></span> have substantially the construction already described; but the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> slide 12</span> instead of being operated by a button has its inner end turned outward to form an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> operating-finger 19</span>, which projects through a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> wide slot 20</span>, formed in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> lever member 3</span>. In this modified construction the slide has the same<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> nailcleaner 11</span> which engages with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> inwardlyturned locking-lug 10</span>, formed integral with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lever member 2</span>. In this modified construction also instead of employing a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> fiat spring 9</span> I employ a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> spiral spring 21</span>, encircling the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> pivot 6</span> and having its respective ends engaged with the inner faces of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lever <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">members 2 and 3</span></span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the modified construction shown by Figs. 11 and 12 the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lever <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">members 2 and 3</span></span> have the same or substantially the same construction as those before described, as well-as the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> slide 12</span> with its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> inwardly-offset nail-cleaner 11</span> for engagement with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> inwardly-turned lockinglug 10</span>, formed integral with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lever member 2</span>. In this construction, however, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> operating-spring 22</span> is mounted in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> lever member 3</span>, its fork-like inner portion embracing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> slide 12</span> and its free outer end being extended through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> clearance-opening 4</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lever member 2</span> and bent to form a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> hook 23</span>, which grips the inner edge of the said opening, Fig. 11, so as to prevent the two lever members from flying apart to too great a distance under the pressure of the spring, which is held in place by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> bridge 13</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the modified construction shown by Figs. 13 to 15, inclusive, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lever <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">members 2 and 3</span></span> are of substantially the construction elsewhere shown; but instead of employing a lockingslide I employ a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> rotary post 24</span>, journaled in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> lever member 2</span> and rotated by means of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> triangular finger-piece 25</span>, bearing upon the outer face of the said lever member. At its inner end the post is formed with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> cam 26</span>, engaging with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> an inwardly-turned integral locking-lug 10</span>, formed in this instance upon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> lever member 3</span>. In this construction the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> operating-spring 27</span> consists of a fiat strip of sheet metal bent midway of its length to form a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> sleeve 28</span> to embrace the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> pivot 6</span>, whereby it is held in place, the respective ends of the spring engaging with the inner face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> respec<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">tive lever members 2 and 3</span></span>.   </p>
