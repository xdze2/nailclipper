                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A nail clipper includes a clipper body having a front section and a rear section acting as a first handle, the front section including a top plate and a base plate defining a passageway therebetween. The top plate and the base plate each has an aperture substantially aligned to each other and adapted to receive a finger nail therewithin. A blade is slidably positioned in the passageway. The nail clipper further includes a second handle having a front end connected to the blade, and a flexible plate. The first end of the flexible plate is attached to the second handle and the opposing second end of the flexible plate is attached to the first handle. The flexible plate is adapted to normally bias the second handle and the blade in a retracted position rearward from the apertures. However, when the second handle is gripped against the first handle, the bias of the flexible plate is overcome to advance the blade from the retracted position to a forward position in which the cutting edge of the blade passes the apertures to cut a finger nail positioned within the apertures. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates to finger nail clippers, and in particular, to a simplified nail clipper that can be used to cut both natural and artificial nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Description of the Related Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Long finger nails have been popular for some time. Women, and some men, deliberately allow specific nails to grow, or others simply attach artificial nails to their existing nails to provide the appearance of longer natural finger nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The process of attaching artificial nails can be rather troublesome. Artificial finger nails are typically composed of elongate plastic material such as acetate or styrene with a crescent-shaped cross-section similar to that of a natural nail but much thicker. Artificial nails are typically first attached to the natural nail and then clipped to length with a series of lateral cuts across the nail to form a rough outline of desired nail curvature. The roughened edge is filed to a smooth continuous curvature and then buffed to complete the process. In the filing step, harmful plastic dust is introduced into the surrounding environment. A full set of artificial nails can take up to two hours to apply using the above process.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Attempts have been made to simplify this process for applying a set of artificial nails. One such attempt is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,856,190 to Gary J. Reiswig, which discloses a clipper which purportedly clips an artificial nail to its final shape with a single cut and with selective curvature to minimize the filing needed after clipping. The clipper comprises a clipper body having a stationary handle and a head section which forms a rectangular passage through which a blade is slidably housed. A movable handle pivots on the clipper body about a first pin, while a second pin couples the movable handle to the rear end of an elongated flat link. The link comprises a notch having an upper tongue insertable into a slot on the blade. A spring couples the link to the stationary handle and biases the link downwardly in a counterclockwise direction shown in FIG. 1. The notch and its upper tongue are coupled to the slot of the blade. If the movable handle is pivotally closed against the stationary handle, the notch of the link will drive the blade toward a forward position shown in phantom in FIG. 3. Upon releasing the movable handle, the spring urges the movable handle away from the stationary handle causing the upper tongue of the link to pull or retract the blade from its forward position back to its original position. The nail holder is provided with a crescent shaped aperture adapted to retain an artificial nail. In use, the movable handle is closed to cause the blade to be driven to its forward position, passing over the aperture and severing the nail held in the aperture.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      While the clipper described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,856,190 is helpful in simplifying the process of applying a set of artificial nails, it is also relatively expensive due to its complex construction. The complex construction also compromises the reliability of the clipper. For example, the movable handle controls the sliding action of the blade through the link mechanism which couples the blade to the movable handle. Therefore, the reliability and performance of the clipper will be diminished if the notch and upper tongue of the link becomes worn or disengaged through extended or careless use. The same could happen if the spring becomes worn or loose through extended use. When the link becomes ineffective, the entire nail clipper must be replaced.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Thus, there is a need for a nail clipper that has a simple and durable construction, is reliable, safe and easy to use, and can be provided at low cost to the consumer.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The objects of the present invention may be achieved by providing a nail clipper having a clipper body. The clipper body has a front section and a rear section acting as a first handle. The front section has a top plate and a base plate defining a passageway therebetween. The top plate and the base plate each includes an aperture substantially aligned to each other and adapted to receive a finger nail therewithin. A blade is slidably positioned in the passageway, and has a cutting edge. The nail clipper further includes a second handle having a front end connected to the blade, and a flexible plate. The first end of the flexible plate is attached to the second handle and the opposing second end of the flexible plate is attached to the first handle. The flexible plate is adapted to normally bias the second handle and the blade in a retracted position rearward from the apertures. The second handle is adapted to be gripped against the first handle to overcome the bias of the flexible plate to advance the blade from the retracted position to a forward position in which the cutting edge of the blade passes the apertures to cut a finger nail positioned within the apertures. The normal bias of the flexible plate slides the blade and the second handle rearwardly when the grip of the second handle against the first handle is released.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Thus, the nail clipper according to the present invention has a simple construction. The blade is directly connected to the front end of the second handle so that the second handle directly controls the sliding operation of the blade. This improves the reliability and durability of the clipper since the direct connection between the blade and the second handle eliminates the need for an additional linking mechanism which would increase the opportunity for defect. In addition, the flexible plate is durable and effective for biasing the second handle in the rearward direction. Thus, the nail clipper has a simple construction, is reliable and durable, is safe and easy to use, and its simple construction allows it to be provided at low cost to the consumer.  </p>

                        <p>      DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The following detailed description is of the best presently contemplated modes of carrying out the invention. This description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating general principles of embodiments of the invention. The scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIGS. 1-6. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> has an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> elongated clipper body 12</span> having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> front section 14</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> rear section 16</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> front section 14</span> comprises a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> base plate 18</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> top plate 20</span> connected by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> two si<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">des 19 and 21</span></span> by riveting, soldering, welding, or any other conventional attachment mechanism. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> base plate 18</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> top plate 20</span> have substantially the same width such that, when connected together by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> sides <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">19 and 21</span></span>, they define a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> substantially rectangular passageway 22</span> through which a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade 24</span> is slidably positioned. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> front end 25</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> front section 14</span> is closed or sealed as a safety feature to prevent the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade 24</span> from sliding out of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> passageway 22</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> top plate 20</span> includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> substantially longitudinal slot 26</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> crescent-shaped aperture 28</span> forward of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> longitudinal slot 26</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> base plate 18</span> also has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> crescent-shaped aperture 30</span> which is substantially aligned with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> crescent-shaped aperture 28</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> top plate 20</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> rear section 16</span> of the clipper body defines a stationary handle. A plurality of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> corrugations 32</span> are provided adjacent the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> rear end 34</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> handle 16</span>. In one embodiment, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> base plate 18</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> front section 14</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> handle 16</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> rear section 16</span> comprise one integral plate which extends throughout the length of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> clipper body 12</span>. In another embodiment, the front and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> rear s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">ections 14 and 16</span></span> may be provided separately and then attached by welding, soldering, or other conventional attachment mechanisms. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> clipper body 12</span> preferably has an elongated configuration with a length of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem95"> about 95</span> mm to 100 mm from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> front end 25</span> to its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> rear end 34</span>, and a width of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> about 18</span> mm to 20 mm. The height of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> passageway 22</span>, or the distance between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> top plate 20</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> base plate 18</span>, ranges from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> about 3</span> mm to 3.5 mm.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> further comprises a movable handle that is connected to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> rear section or handle 16</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> clipper body 12</span> by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> flexible spring plate 42</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> movable handle 40</span> comprises a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> slot 44</span> through which a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> narrowed first end 46</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> flexible plate 42</span> is fitted and held. Although the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> slot 44</span> is illustrated as being provided about a central portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> handle 40</span>, it can also be provided anywhere along the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> handle 40</span> without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Also, instead of fitting a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> narrowed end 46</span> into a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> slot 44</span>, other mechanisms can be used to accomplish the connection between the first end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> flexible spring plate 42</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> second handle 40</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47"> opposing second end 47</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> flexible spring plate 42</span> is connected to a top surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> rear section or handle 16</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> flexible spring plate 42</span> may be provided as a separate piece and then connected to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> handle 16</span> by soldering, welding, riveting or other conventional attachment methods, or may be provided integrally with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> handle 16</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> front end 48</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> handle 40</span> is connected to, or provided integrally with, the back end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade 24</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade 24</span> comprises a plate with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> sharp cutting edge 50</span> at its front end. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> longitudinal slot 26</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> top plate 20</span> is preferably wide enough to allow the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> front end 48</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> handle 40</span> to slide in reciprocal manner within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> slot 26</span> as the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade 24</span> is reciprocated along the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> passageway 22</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem49"> front surface 49</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> slot 26</span> acts as a stop which prevents further advancement by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> front end 48</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> handle 40</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> movable handle 40</span> has a plurality of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> corrugations 52</span> provided adjacent its rear end. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> corrug<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">ations 32 and 52</span></span> provided on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">s 16 and 40</span></span> assist the user&#39;s fingers in firmly gripping the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">s 16 and 40</span></span> when using the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> movable handle 40</span> has a length ranging from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80"> about 80</span> mm to 83 mm, and is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82"> preferably about 82</span> mm. The width of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> movable handle 40</span> is preferably consistent throughout its length, and ranges from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> about 12</span> mm to 17.5 mm. Although the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> front end 48</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> handle 40</span> is shown as having a width that is about the same as the width of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> handle 40</span>, it is possible to provide a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> narrowed front end 48</span> so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> longitudinal slot 26</span> may also be narrowed if desired. This can be accomplished by tapering the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> handle 40</span> near its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> front end 48</span> so that the width of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> handle 40</span> progressively decreases towards the front end.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The length of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> flexible spring plate 42</span> depends on the location of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> slot 44</span> that receives the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> narrowed first end 46</span>. The width of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> flexible spring plate 42</span> is also not critical, but must be of a sufficient width to provide the desired biasing action to keep the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade 24</span> in the retracted position, as described below.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> hook 33</span> is provided at the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> rear end 34</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> handle 16</span> and is adapted to engage a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> slot 35</span> provided at the rear end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> movable handle 40</span>. This allows the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> two ha<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">ndles 16 and 40</span></span> to be held together to conserve space during packing an shipping.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> handle 40</span> is normally biased by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> flexible spring plate 42</span> in a rearward direction to hold the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade 24</span> in the retracted position in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> passageway 22</span> rearward of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> cresce<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">nt-shaped apertures 28 and 30</span></span>, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. When the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade 24</span> is in the retracted position, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> apertu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">res 28 and 30</span></span> are unobstructed and are adapted to receive a finger nail N (see FIG. 5). To cut a finger nail N, the user inserts the nail N through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> cresce<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">nt-shaped apertures 28 and 30</span></span>, and then presses the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> movable handle 40</span> against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> stationary handle 16</span>. This overcomes the normal bias exerted by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> flexible spring plate 42</span> on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> handle 40</span>, and forces the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade 24</span> to slide forwardly along the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> passageway 22</span> and across the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> apertu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">res 28 and 30</span></span> to cut the finger nail N positioned within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> apertu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">res 28 and 30</span></span>. After the nail N has been cut, the user releases the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> movable handle 40</span>, so that the bias of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> flexible spring plate 42</span> pulls the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> movable handle 40</span> rearwardly to retract the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade 24</span> back to the retracted position shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> clipper body 12</span>, including its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> front section 14</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> rear section 16</span>, together with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade 24</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> movable handle 40</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> flexible spring plate 42</span>, are preferably made from the same material, which may include a metal such as aluminum, stainless steel, high-carbon steel, or steel, or a non-metal such as plastic. Alternatively, each of these components may be made of a different material as desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> according to the present invention has a simple construction. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade 24</span> is directly connected to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> front end 48</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> movable handle 40</span> so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> movable handle 40</span> directly controls the operation of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> blade 24</span>. This improves the reliability and durability of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> clipper 10</span> since the direct connection between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> blade 22</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> movable handle 40</span> eliminates the need for an additional linking mechanism which would increase the opportunity for defect. In addition, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> flexible spring plate 42</span> is durable and effective for biasing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> movable handle 40</span> in the rearward direction. Thus, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> has a simple construction, is reliable and durable, is safe and easy to use, and its simple construction allows it to be provided at low cost to the consumer.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      While the description above refers to particular embodiments of the present invention, it will be understood that many modifications may be made without departing from the spirit thereof. For example, according to another embodiment, instead of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> flexible spring plate 42</span>, a coiled spring (not shown) may be provided without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. According to this embodiment, the spring would have one end connected to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> movable handle 40</span> and a second end connected to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> stationary handle 16</span>, and would likewise operate to normally bias the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> movable handle 40</span> in the rearward direction. </p>
