CARTER, citizens of the United States, residing at Ansonia, in the county of New Haven and State of Connecticut. have invented a new and useful Improvement in F inger-Nail Trimmers; and we do hereby declare the following, when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings and the characters of reference marked thereon, to be a full, clear, and exact description of the same, and which said drawings constitute part of this application, and represent, in   </p>

                        <p>   Our invention relates to an improved finger-nail trimmer, the object being to produce at a low cost for manufacture, a simple, convenient and efiicient toilet-accessory of the character described. WVith these ends in view, our invention consists in a finger-nail trimmer having certain details of construction and combination of parts as will be hereinafterdeseribed and pointed out in the claims.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In carrying out our invention as herein shown, we employ an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> operating-lever 8</span>,   </p>
                    
                        <p>   which is given desired bulk. strength and lightness by forming it of a piece of wrought-metal folded lengthwise into inverted U-shaped form in cross-section, its convex face being uppermost, so as to present a smooth surface to the hand and to the lining of the pocket. At its outer end this lever is symmetrically flattened to form a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> spoon-shaped nail-cleaner 9</span>, which serves to burnish as well as clean the nails. For   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Serial No. 446,099.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   holding the said lever in its closed position the point of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> said nail-cleaner 9</span> is caught under a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> forwardly-opening retaining-finger 10</span>. struck up from the butt or inner end of a filell, which normally rests directly upon the flat upper face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> relatively rigid jaw-member 12</span> of the device in alignment therewith. The said file has its upper face serrated, as at 13, and terminates in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> point 1</span> 1, also adapted to be used for cleaning the nails. At its inner end the file is pivotally mounted upon the enlarged bearing portion at the upper end of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> rivet 15</span>, the shank of which passes downward through the inner end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> rigid jaw-member 12</span> and through the inner end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring jaw-member 16</span>, upon the lower face of which it is headed over, as clearly shown in Figure 41, where by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> rivet 15</span> is made to serve the double purpose of securing the upper and lower jaw-members together and of pivotally mounting the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> file 11</span>. The upper and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> lower <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">jaw-members 12 and 16</span></span> are also secured together by means of an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> aligning rivet 17</span>, whereby the alignment of the two jaw-members is maintained.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   At its forward end, the U-shaped operating-lever is formed with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> transverse clearancenotch 18</span>, which permits it to be swung over&#39;into its full open position as shown in Figure 7. The extreme forward end of the said lever is rounded to form a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> ears 19</span>, perforated to receive a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> pivot 20</span> passing through the upper end of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> post 21</span> riveted at its lower end in the outer end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring jaw-member 16</span>. The forward end of the said lever extends downward, when the lever is lifted, into a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> slot 22</span> in the forward end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> upper jaw-member 12</span>, as shown in Figure 6, the rear wall of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> slot 22</span> being, at this time, engaged by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> two lifting-cams 23</span> formed upon the forward ends of the side walls of the lever for lifting the spring, lower jaw-member with respect to the relatively rigid upper jaw-member to bring their<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">gedges 24 and 25</span></span> together, as the lever is pressed downward into its closed position from which it is lifted into its nailtrimming position by the spring of the said springmember, as soon as downward pressure is removed from its upper face. The lower jaw-member is extended at its inner end beyond the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> rivet 15</span> to form a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> perforated suspension-arm 26</span>, by means of which the device is attached to the watchrhain or the key-chain of the user. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> nail-file 11</span>, when swung in to its open position, greatly increases the over-all length of the device and enables the hand to conveniently grip and manipulate it. Then the lever is thrown over into its full open position the Lbevelled inner wall of its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> clearance-notch 18</span> engages with the forward wall of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> sl<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ot 21</span> in&#39;the upper jaw-member 12</span>, whereby the lever is supported in this position.   </p>
