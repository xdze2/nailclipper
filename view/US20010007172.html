                        <p> A tool for the hygiene and cutting of cuticles, fingernails and toenails, wherein two interchangeable jaws, provided with respective cutting blades, are removably supported by two jaw holders connected to respective handles for gripping the tool itself; the jaw holders and the handles are mutually hinged to rotate the aforementioned jaws between an open position and a closed and cutting position. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0001]    The present invention relates to a tool for the hygiene and cutting cuticles, fingernails and toe nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0002]    In particular, the tool of the present invention is of the type commonly known by the name of nail clippers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0003]    Known nail clippers usually comprise two metal arms mutually connected in crossed position by means of a pivot pin for the rotation of the arms themselves. Each arm presents, at opposite sides of the pivot pin, a longer portion, which is curved and shaped in such a way as to define a handle for gripping the nail clippers, and a shorter portion, which defines a jaw with a pointed end and provided with a cutting blade.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0004]    The blades of the two jaws are positioned facing each other and are forced against one another in a side-by-side cutting position when the handles are forced against one another in a close position of closure.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0005]    In such a tool, it is necessary for the blades to be sharpened periodically with sharpening operations which are rather costly. Moreover, each sharpening operation causes the tool to be unavailable for a more or less long period of time, thereby entailing the need to have a back-up tool available, with the deriving additional costs.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0006]    In addition to the aforesaid drawback, known nail clippers of the kind described above present the drawback of being difficult to sterilize in order to allow their hygienic use by more than one person. This difficulty fundamentally derives from the fact that known sterilizing fluids tend to oxidize its blades rather easily. On the other hand, dry sterilization is oftentimes not very effective and, hence, not very safe.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    The aim of the present invention is to provide a tool for the hygiene and cutting of cuticles and fingernails and toe nails which is free from the drawbacks described above.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0008]    According to the present invention a tool for the hygiene and cutting of cuticles and fingernails and toe nails is provided, comprising two jaws provided with respective cutting blades, characterized in that it comprises two jaw holders able removably to support said jaws and mutually hinged to rotate the jaws themselves between an open position and a closed and cutting position; said jaws being interchangeable.   </p>

                        <p>        [0018]    With reference to FIG. 1, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">reference number  1</span>  indicates in its entirety a set of nail clippers for the hygiene and cutting of cuticles, fingernails and toenails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail clippers  1</span>  are wholly made of stainless steel and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">comprise two arms  2</span>   a ,  2   b  mutually hinged by means of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">pivot pin  3</span>  in correspondence with respective ends defined by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">appendices  4</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]    Each arm  2</span>   a ,  2   b  presents, at opposite sides of its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">own appendix  4</span> , a longer portion, which is curved and shaped in such a way as to define a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">handle  5</span>  for gripping the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail clippers  1</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">short end portion  6</span> , which bears hinged a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">respective jaw holder  7</span>   a ,  7   b  by means of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">pivot pin  8</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]    In proximity to its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">own appendix  4</span> , at the opposite side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">end portion  6</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">each arm  2</span>   a ,  2   b  bears a screwed on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">cylindrical element  9</span> , which is oriented in the same direction as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">appendix  4</span>  itself and serves as an internal support element for a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">helical spring  10</span>  interposed between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">arms  2</span>   a ,  2   b  themselves.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">jaw holder  7</span>   a , shown in greater detail in FIGS. 4, 5 and  6 , is connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">respective arm  2</span>   a  through its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">own end portion  11</span>  defined by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">two appendices  12</span>  positioned at opposite sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">portion  6</span>  and hinged thereon by means of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">aforementioned pivot pin  8</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">jaw holder  7</span>   a  is provided with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">seat  13</span>  able removably to support a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">respective interchangeable jaw  14</span>   a , shown, in detail, in FIGS. 10, 11 and  12 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">jaw  14</span>   a  is defined by a single piece so shaped as to present a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">tip  15</span>  provided with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting blade  16</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">substantially cylindrical terminal body  17</span>  provided with an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">intermediate annular groove  18</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">substantially cylindrical central body  19</span>  positioned between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">tip  15</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">aforesaid terminal body  17</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]    In particular, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">central body  19</span>  presents a diameter that is greater than the diameter of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">terminal body  17</span>  and is partially flattened, at the part confining with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">terminal body  17</span>  itself, in order <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">to present two planar rectangular faces  20</span>  diametrically opposite to each other.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">seat  13</span>  for supporting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">jaw holder  7</span>   a  presents a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">first compartment  21</span>  for receiving and supporting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">central body  19</span> , and, in communication with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">compartment  21</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second compartment  22</span>  able to house the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">terminal body  17</span>  in its interior.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]    Specifically, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">compartment  21</spa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">n>  presents two planar lateral walls  23</span> , mutually parallel, which are at a mutual distance approximating by excess the distance between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">faces  20</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">central body  19</span>  so as to be coupled, each, with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">respective face  20</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">compartment  21</span>  also presents a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">bottom planar wall  24</span> , which is orthogonal to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">walls  23</span>  and serves as a support wall for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">central body  19</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0029]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">bottom wall  24</span>  centrally presents a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">circular hole  25</span>  for communicating with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">cylindrical cavity  26</span>  defining the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second compartment  22</span> . In particular, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">cavity  26</span>  presents a diameter approximating by excess the diameter of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">terminal body  17</span> , and is placed in “T” communication with an additional cylindrical cavity defined by a through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">hole  27</span>  obtained in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">jaw holder  7</span>   a . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">hole  27</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">cavity  26</span>  pres<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">ent respective mutually orthogonal axes  28</span>  and  29 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0030]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">jaw  14</span>   a , once housed in its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">seat  13</span> , is axially locked in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">seat  13</span>  itself by means of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">screw  30</span>  screwed inside the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">hole  27</span>  and terminating inside the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">groove  18</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0031]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">jaw  14</span>   b  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">jaw holder  7</span>   b  are substantially similar to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">jaw  14</span>   a  and to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">jaw holder  7</span>   a  described above. In particular, for the reason described above, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">jaw holder  7</span>   b  is shown in FIGS. 7, 8 and  9  with the same reference numbers used to describe the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">jaw holder  7</span>   a.     </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0032]    Lastly, as shown in FIG. 1, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">jaw holders  7</span>   a  and  7   b  are mutually connected, in correspondence with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">respective end appendices  31</span>  positioned adjacent to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">seats  13</span> , by means of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">pivot pin  32</span>  parallel to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">pivot pins  3</span>  and  8  and to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">screws  30</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0033]    In conclusion of the above, it should be stressed that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">tip  15</span>  of the pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">interchangeable jaws  14</span>   a ,  14   b  can have a different shape from the one shown in FIGS. 10, 11 and  12  described above. In this regard and as shown in FIGS. 13 and 14, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">aforementioned tip  15</span>  assumes, respectively, a shape particularly suitable for cutting cuticles and a shape particularly suitable for cutting in-grown nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0034]    This, in fact, constitutes a further advantage of the present invention, since it allows to have available, for each nail clipper set of the type described above, a plurality of jaws, each dedicated to a particular cutting requirement.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0035]    It should, moreover, be noted that the interchangeable jaws, thanks to their relatively low cost, can conveniently be of the disposable type.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0036]    The invention thus conceived can be subject to numerous modifications and variations, without thereby departing from the scope of the inventive concept. Moreover, all components can be replaced by technically equivalent elements. </p>
