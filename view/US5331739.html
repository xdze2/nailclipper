Preferably, the body member is fabricated from a plastic material, and the cutting blades are fabricated from a metal material. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The invention relates to nail cutting nippers or clippers, and more particularly, to nail cutting nippers or clippers which are disposable, and which have cutting members which can be removed and disposed of, thus permitting the body member thereof to be used several times before disposal thereof.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Nail cutting nippers or clippers are well known in the art, where most of the prior art devices are fabricated from a metal material and therefore are not of the disposable type, though some do have removable cutting blades. Due to the current fear of contracting AIDS, people are very cautious when it comes to utensils which possibly may come in contact with another person&#39;s blood, such being the case when cutting a person&#39;s finger nails. Therefore, for the person&#39;s safety, it would be recommended that the nail cutting nippers or clippers be disposed of after each time it is used on a particular person, where it would even be helpful if only the cutting blades themselves were disposed of after use on the particular person.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Thus, there is a need for disposable nail cutting nippers which can be used for cutting or trimming a person&#39;s nails or cuticles, so that the entire nippers or at least the cutting blades of the nippers can be thrown away after cutting a person&#39;s nails or cuticles. Accordingly, if any blood is drawn by the cutting blades, these cutting blades when disposed of cannot contaiminate the next person having their nails and cuticles trimmed or cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Most of the prior art devices are in the form of scissors or pliers, where the handles thereof pivot around a pin which connects the handles together. U.S. Pat. No. 770,032, No. 806,037 and No. 1,976,067 disclose nail clippers or cutters in the form of a pair of pliers which are activated by pressing the ends of the handles together, each having removable cutting blades disposed at the opposite ends of the handles, the handles being fabricated from a metal material.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 4,819,673 discloses a nail clipper having a one piece U-shaped configuration fabricated from a plastic material with removable cutting blades disposed on one side thereof which are connected to a front side edge of each handle, which is activated by squeezing the rear free ends of the handles together, the bight portion at the front end thereof providing a spring hinge at the front end. The nail clipper device of the latter patent contains a safety feature which prevents the user from being cut while clipping his nails, so that there does not appear to be any intention therein to dispose of the nail clipper or the cutting blades thereof after using same on a particular person to avoid being contaminated with AIDS.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>

                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cutting member 14</span> is now inserted, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> bight portion 48</span> first, into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> slot 42</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> hinge portion 20</span> from the outside thereof, by squeezing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> leg po<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">rtions 44, 46</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cutting member 14</span> together until the end walls of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> slot 4<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">2</span<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">> snap into notches 54, 56</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cutting member 14</span>, as best shown in FIG. 4. It is noted, that when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">g blades 50, 52</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cutting member 14</span> are in the open position, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 4, the distance between the end walls of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> slot 42</span> is approximately equal to the distance between the base walls of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> notche<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">s 54, 56</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cutting member 14</span> so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cutting member 14</span> is securely attached to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body member 12</span>, where the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> leg po<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">rtions 44, 46</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cutting member 14</span> are in a non-tensioned position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In use, the user grips the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body member 12</span>, preferably at the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> ridges<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> 34, 36</span></span>, and squeezes the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> grippi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">ng portions 16, 18</span></span> together, thereby applying a force on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39"> spring hinge 39</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> tab member 38</span>. During this squeezing action, the end walls of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> slot 42</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> hinge portion 20</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body member 12</span> are pivoted closer together while seated in their<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> associ<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">ated notches 54, 56</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cutting member 14</span>, so that in turn, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> leg po<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">rtions 44, 46</span></span> are also squeezed together until the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">g blades 50, 52</span></span> are brought together, as shown in FIG. 5. Thus, anything disposed between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">g blades 50, 52</span></span>, such as a person&#39;s finger nail, will be cut by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">g blades 50, 52</span></span>. When the user releases the tension on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> grippi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">ng portions 16, 18</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body member 12</span>, both the spring tension in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cutting member 14</span> and in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39"> spring hinge 39</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> tab member 38</span> force the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">g blades 50, 52</span></span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> grippi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">ng portions 16, 18</span></span> to their open non-tensioned positions shown in FIG. 1. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nippers 10</span> are now ready to be used again to further cut the person&#39;s finger nails, where this procedure is repeated until all the finger nails are cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      After a person&#39;s finger nails are cut, the user can either dispose of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> entire nippers 10</span>, and use a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> new nippers 10</span> for the next person, or the user can merely remove the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cutting member 14</span> from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body member 12</span> by squeezing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> leg po<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">rtions 44, 46</span></span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cutting member 14</span> together until the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> notche<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">s 54, 56</span></span> are released, and replace same with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> new cutting member 14</span>, as desired, where the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body member 12</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nippers 10</span> can be used many times before the disposal thereof in that, because of the construction thereof, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body member 12</span> does not come in contact with any of the persons having their nails cut. Thus, according to the user&#39;s discretion, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> body member 12</span> itself can be used as many times as desired, but the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cutting member 14</span> is always replaced for use on each new person.  </p>

Thus, when the user releases the tension on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> grippi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">ng portions 68, 70</span></span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> spring hinge portion 72</span> forces the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> grippi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">ng portions 68, 70</span></span> apart to the open non-tensioned position shown in FIG. 6, in which the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">g members 64, 66</span></span> are again spaced apart, as best shown in FIG. 9. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> nippers 60</span> are now ready to be used again to further cut the person&#39;s finger nails, where this procedure is repeated until all the finger nails are cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Here again, after a person&#39;s finger nails are cut, the user can either dispose of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> entire nippers 60</span>, and use a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> new nippers 60</span> for the next person, or the user can merely remove the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">g members 64, 66</span></span> from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> grippi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">ng portions 68, 70</span></span> and replace same with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> new cu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">tting members 64, 66</span></span>, as desired, where the body member of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> nippers 60</span> can be used many times before the disposal thereof in that, because of the construction thereof, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> body member 62</span> does not come in contact with any of the persons having their nails cut. Thus, according to the user&#39;s discretion, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> body member 62</span> itself can be used as many times as desired, but the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">g blades 64, 66</span></span> are always replaced for use on each new person.  </p>
