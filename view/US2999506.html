                        <p>  NAIL CLIPPER Filed. Dec. 20, 1957 I NV ENTUR.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2,999,506 NAIL CLIPPER John W. Hunt, Pontiac, Mich., assignor to Pontiac Specialties Manufacturing Corporation, Pontiac, Mich., a corporation of Michigan Filed Dec. 20, 1957, Ser. No. 704,085 8 Claims. (Cl. 132-755) This invention relates to manicure implements and more particularly to a one-piece pocket device which is a combination of a nail clipper, cleaner and file.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is a principal object of the present invention to provide a pocket manicure implement capable of clipping cleaning and filing nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  It is a further object of this invention to provide such an implement having a one-piece construction.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object of the invention is the provision of a manicure device which can be completely formed in one stamping operation and then hardened by heat treating to form a finished product without requiring additional fabricating operations such as welding, grinding, honing or assembly.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A further object of this invention is the provision of a manicure device having a pair of scissor-action cutting jaws to facilitate the clipping of finger nails on either the right Or left hand with equal ease and which are provided with guide means to aid in cutting the nails to the proper length.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A still further object is to provide a locked condition for the manicure implement when not in use thereby to protect the cutting jaws against damage and to enable the device to be carried in a pocket or ladys handbag withous danger of injury to the person or damage to his clothes.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Other objects of this invention will appear in the following description and appended claims, reference being had to the accompanying drawings forming a part of this specification wherein like reference characters designate corresponding parts in the several views.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In the drawings:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 1 is a view in perspective of one embodiment of the present invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  FIG. 2 is a top plan view of the FIG. 1 embodiment.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIG. 3 is a side elevational view of another embodiment of the present invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Before explaining the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and arrangement of parts illustrated in the accompanying drawings, since the invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology or terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The manicure implement is formed from a strip of heat treatable metal, preferably a spring steel or the like. The continuous one-piece construction comprises an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> upper arm 12</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> lower arm 14</span> hingedly secured together at one end by means of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> plate spring portion 16</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring 16</span> may be provided with a plurality of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> relief openings 18</span> to control the spring rate. The spring rate may also be reduced by narrowing the width or reducing the thickness of the cross-section at the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> turning point 17</span>. The   </p>
                    
                        <p>  thickness may conveniently be reduced by a coining operation during the fabricating process.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As indicated in the FIG. 1 embodiment, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> lower arm 14</span> is provided on each side, at a point adjacent the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring portion 16</span>, with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> upwardly extending shearing blade 20</span> which is receivable in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> rectangular recess 22</span> provided on each side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> upper arm 12</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> shearing blades 20</span> may be provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> notches 24</span> in the upper corners remote from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring 16</span> to abut against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> upper arm 12</span> and act as a stop when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> arms 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">2, 14</span></span> are pivoted towards one another.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> shearing blades 20</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> recesses 22</span> cooperate to act as cutting jaws for trimming finger nails. The inner surfaces of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> blades<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> 20</span> form shearing edges 26</span> which .remote from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring 16</span> and proceeds towards the spring &#39;16. This is accomplished by tapering the upper portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> blades 20</span> downwardly toward the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring 16</span> and off-setting the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> arm 12</span> from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring 16</span> by means of an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> upwardly projecting portion 32</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> arm 12</span> is preferably olf-set at a point adjacent the spring side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> recesses 22</span>. This arrangement tends to stiffen the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> arm 12</span> adjacent the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring 16</span> to thus move the pivot point away from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring 16</span> and to increase the distance between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> sheari<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">ng edges 26, 28</span></span> when the device is in the normal open position. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> upper arm 12</span> may be bent upwardly at a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37"> point 37</span> intermediate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> recesses 22</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> point 34</span> to provide a longer travel for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> arm 12</span> during the shearing process.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   When the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> arms 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">2, 14</span></span> are in a closed position as shown in FIG. 2, the upper surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> shearing blade 20</span> is substantially flush with the upper surface of the upper.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">   </p>
                    
                        <p>  arm 12</span>. This arrangement provides protection for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> sheari<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">ng edges 26, 28</span></span> against being nicked or otherwise,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  damaged when carried in a pocket or purse and also forms a smooth outer surface having no sharp projections which could damage the users clothes or person.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> manicure implement 10</span> may be locked in the.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">   </p>
                    
                        <p>  point 34</span> to engage the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> recess 36</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> device 10</span> will resume approximately its normal position when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> point 34</span> is seated in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> recess 36</span> thus providing a firmly locked position. There will, however, be some distortion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> device 10</span> which will result in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> notches 24</span> abutting against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> outer end walls 19</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> recesses 22</span>. The resulting biasing of these surfaces aids in securely locking the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> device 10</span> in a closed position. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> point 34</span>, in addition to acting as part of the locking means, serves as a nail scraper for cleaning beneath the finger nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The upper surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> bottom arm 14</span> may be provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> lateral serrations 40</span> to serve as a nail file portion.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> Openin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">gs 42, 44</span></span> may also be provided in one end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> arm 14</span> for the insertion of a key ring chain.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3 is similar in all respects to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> device 10</span> hereinbefore described excepting that the position of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> shearing blade 20</span>&#39; and recesses 22- is reversed. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> blade 20</span>&#39; extends downwardly from the Patented Sept. 12,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> .1961:   </p>
                    
                        <p>  upper arm 12</span>&#39;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> and&#39;the cooperating recesses 22</span>&#39; are provided in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> lower arm 14</span>&#34;. This alternate form will operate with comparable effectiveness to the embodiment previously described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> manicure implement 10</span>, when used as a nail clipper, may be held in one hand and a finger nail of the other hand inserted past the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> sheari<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">ng edges 26, 28</span></span> preferably at a slightly downward angle and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> arms 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">2, 14</span></span> pivoted towards one another. The cutting action will proceed in a scissor-like fashion from the back of the jaws forward i.e. towards the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring 16</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> blade 20</span> acts as a guide to determine the length of the cutnail. The. extending portion of the finger nail-will thusbe ap proximately equal to thethiclgne&#39;s&#39;s&#39; of the blade ztl. If it is desired to cut the hail shorter, the device may be turned upside down and applied with the upper surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> blade 20</span> abutting against the outer surface of the nails rather than&#39;the inner surface. Two cutting jaws are provided, one on either side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> device 10</span>, to facilit&#39;ate&#39;c&#39;lipping the nail of either the right or the left hand with equal ease. i   </p>
                    
                        <p>  &#39; The preferred method of releasing the manicure implement &#39;10 from the locked condition is to hold it in one hand with&#39;the index finger extended beneath the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> arm 14</span> about A; from the end. With the thumb extended, pressure-is exerted on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> point 34</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> upturned end 38</span> thus distorting these parts and forcing them apart. Due-to the action of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring 16</span> the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> arm 12</span> will move away from and out of engagement with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> end 38</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   To use the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> device 10</span> as a nail cleaner, it is preferable to hold it with the index finger wedged between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> arms 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">2, 14</span></span> thus forcing them further apart and providing finger clearance about the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> point 34</span>. The pressure of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> arms 12</span> 14 against the index finger will aid in securing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> device 10</span> in this nail cleaning position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The clipper as described is thus seen to be inexpensively constructed and effective in use. The one piece structure and&#39;the over all design of the cooperating parts permits the clipper to be fabricated in one operation by, for example, a progressive or follow die. This reduces the tooling and fabrication costs with a resultant low unit cost per manicure implement. 7   </p>
