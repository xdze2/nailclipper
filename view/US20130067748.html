                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> An apparatus for safely clipping nails comprises a blade/base assembly, a lever, and a shaft. The blade/base assembly comprises a blade incorporating a sharp cutting edge, a base incorporating a ledge having a front face for aligning the tool to the nail and a top face for supporting the nail, and a rivet to fix said blade to said base. The lever is designed to actuate the apparatus, having a fixed end, an unconstrained end, and a cam. The fixed end is mechanically fixed to said blade/base assembly by means of a shaft designed to place said blade/base assembly into a spring-loaded condition. The cam is designed to compress the blade/base assembly as the unconstrained end of the lever is pressed toward blade/base assembly, thereby causing the sharp cutting edge to clamp down upon and cut through the nail. </p>

                        <p> CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    This application claims the benefit of and is a continuation of prior U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/494,357,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> filed 13</span> Jun. 2011.  </p>
                    
                        <p>       </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    The present invention generally relates to apparatus for clipping nails and, more specifically, to a nail clipper apparatus for safely clipping the fingernails or toenails of young children and others who may require care in the trimming of nails, such as the elderly, persons with poor eyesight, or disabled persons.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    The trimming of fingernails and toenails is important to the safety, appearance and hygiene of a person. Further, when a child&#39;s nails are not trimmed, especially a young infant, the child may scratch his/her face and eyes, causing injury.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    For some persons, the trimming of fingernails and toenails may pose a particular challenge. For example, young children, elderly people with poor eyesight, or those with other disabilities may find it difficult or impossible to trim their own nails. When a person clips the nails of another person, the person performing the clipping cannot feel whether the clipper is properly positioned to correctly and safely trim the nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    Conventional nail clippers include sharp upper and lower blades. In U.S. Pat. No. 1,702,137, Schnefel discloses an example of a conventional nail clipper featuring sharp upper and lower blades. When people use these conventional nail clippers, especially when trimming the nails of another person, they often unintentionally clip the flesh underneath the nail with the sharp bottom blade of the clippers, thereby causing injury.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    As can be understood, there is a need for an apparatus and method for safely trimming the nails of young children and infants, and of other persons for whom trimming of fingernails and toenails may be a challenge.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0007]    In view of the limitations and disadvantages inherent to conventional means of trimming nails, it is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method for trimming nails that reduces the risk of injury.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    According to one aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for safely clipping nails (hereinafter “safety clipper”) comprises a blade/base assembly, a lever, and a shaft. The blade/base assembly comprises a blade, incorporating a sharp cutting edge for cutting a nail; a base, incorporating a ledge having a front face for aligning the tool to the nail to be clipped and a top face for supporting the nail as the safety clipper is used; and a rivet designed and configured to mechanically fix said blade to said base. The lever is designed to actuate the apparatus, having a fixed end, an unconstrained end, and a cam feature. The fixed end is mechanically fixed to said blade/base assembly by means of a shaft that incorporates a slot designed to simultaneously capture the fixed end of the lever and to place said blade/base assembly into a spring-loaded condition. The cam feature is designed to compress the blade/base assembly as the unconstrained end of the lever is pressed toward blade/base assembly, thereby causing the sharp cutting edge to clamp down on the nail, capturing the nail between the sharp cutting edge and the ledge, and causing the sharp cutting edge to cut through the nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    According to another aspect of the present invention, the top face of the ledge incorporates a groove that is designed and configured to align with the sharp cutting edge of the blade and to enable the sharp cutting edge to cut all the way through the nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those with skill in the art from the following figures, descriptions and claims. As will be appreciated by those with skill in the art, the apparatus and method of the present invention may be implemented in a plurality of equivalent embodiments. Such alternative embodiments, and their attendant objects, aspects and advantages, are within the scope of the present invention and, therefore, the examples set forth herein shall not be limiting.  </p>

A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">blade  14</span>  may be mechanically fixed to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">base  12</span>  by means of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">rivet  20</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever  16</span>  may be mechanically fixed to this <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">blade  <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">14</span> /base  12</span>  assembly by means of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">shaft  18</span>  which incorporates a slot designed to simultaneously capture the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever  16</span>  and to place the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">blade  <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">14</span> /base  12</span>  assembly into a spring-loaded condition. As illustrated in perspective detail view  FIG. 1D , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">blade  14</span>  may incorporate a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">sharp cutting edge  22</span>  designed to cut through a nail. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">base  12</span>  may incorporate a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ledge  24</span> , having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">front face  28</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">top face  26</span> . A front portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ledge  24</span>  may extend outwardly and beyond the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">sharp cutting edge  22</span>  when the blade is closed against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ledge  24</span> , as shown in  FIGS. 1C and 1D .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]    As shown in  FIG. 1C , the top view profile of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">blade  14</span>  at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">sharp cutting edge  22</span>  may be concave in order to conform to the convex shape of a nail. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">front face  28</span>  may be a flat or curved surface configured to align the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">safety clipper  10</span>  to the nail to be trimmed. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">top face  26</span>  may comprise a generally flat surface designed to align the safety clipper to the nail to be clipped and to support the nail as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">safety clipper  10</span>  is in use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]      FIG. 2  illustrates a method of deploying the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">safety clipper  10</span>  of  FIG. 1  from the stowed configuration to the ready-for-use configuration, according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">safety clipper  10</span>  may be deployed in the following manner. First, as illustrated in  FIG. 2A , the unconstrained end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever  16</span>  may be lifted away from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">blade  14</span>  and rotated forward and over the centerline axis of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">shaft  18</span> , the restrained end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever  16</span>  thereby compressing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring-<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">loaded blade  14</span> /base  12</span>  assembly, until the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever  16</span>  reaches the over-centered position, as illustrated in  FIG. 2A . Then, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180"> 16</span>  may be rotated 180</span> degrees about the centerline axis of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">shaft  18</span> , as illustrated in  FIG. 2B , until the lever reaches the ready-for-use position, as illustrated in  FIG. 2C . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">safety clipper  10</span>  may subsequently be reconfigured after use into its stowed, safe configuration by reversing the deployment steps.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]      FIG. 3  illustrates a method of using the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">safety clipper  10</span>  of  FIG. 1 , according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. Starting with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">safety clipper  10</span>  in the ready-for-use configuration, as illustrated in  FIG. 3A , a user of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">safety clipper  10</span>  may align the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">safety clipper  10</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail  40</span>  to be trimmed by placing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">top face  26</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ledge  24</span>  beneath the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail  40</span>  to be trimmed, and pressing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">front face  28</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ledge  24</span>  against the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">finger  42</span>  beneath the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail  40</span> , as illustrated in  FIG. 3B . The user of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">safety clipper  10</span>  may then press downward on the unconstrained end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever  16</span> , as illustrated in  FIG. 3C . As the unconstrained end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever  16</span>  is pressed downward toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">blade  14</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cam feature  30</span>  of the lever may force the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">sharp cutting edge  22</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">blade  14</span>  to clamp down on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail  40</span> , capturing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail  40</span>  between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">sharp cutting edge  22</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">top face  26</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ledge  24</span> , as illustrated in  FIG. 3C . As the downward force on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever  16</span>  is increased, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">sharp cutting edge  22</span>  may cut through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail  40</span> , thereby removing the unwanted portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail  40</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]    In one embodiment of the invention, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">top face  26</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ledge  24</span>  may be a generally flat surface.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    In an alternative embodiment of the invention, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">groove  32</span>  may be incorporated into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">top face  26</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ledge  24</span> , as shown in  FIGS. 1D , and  3 B. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">groove  32</span>  may work in conjunction with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">sharp cutting edge  22</span>  to allow the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">sharp cutting edge  22</span>  to cut all the way through the thickness of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail  40</span> , as opposed to pinching the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail  40</span> . The cross-section of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">groove  32</span>  may be in the shape of a “V”, as shown in  FIGS. 1D and 3B , or any other useful and practical shape. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">groove  32</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ledge  24</span>  may also provide a visual cue to allow the user to see exactly where the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">sharp edge  20</span>  will trim the nail. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">groove  32</span>  may also be designed as a guide to control the length of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail  40</span>  to be left after clipping by adjusting the distance of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">groove  32</span>  from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">front face  28</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ledge  24</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]    The components of the safety clipper may be made of any useful material including, but not limited to metal, wood, plastic or rubber.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]    In alternative embodiments of the invention, the top face of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">ledge  26</span>  may be a contrasting color to that of skin and nails and/or illuminated such that the user may see that only the nail (and no skin) is resting on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ledge  24</span>  and, therefore, that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail  40</span>  is ready to safely be trimmed. In further alternative embodiments, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">groove  32</span>  may be a contrasting color to that of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ledge  24</span>  or illuminated for increased visibility and accuracy. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ledge  24</span>  may have a rubber surface or overlay to enhance positioning of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">safety clipper  10</span>  between the nail and the tip of the finger under the nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]    In still further alternative embodiments of the invention, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">base  12</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">blade  14</span>  and/or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever  16</span>  may be encased in a material including, but not limited to, plastic, rubber or paint which may act as an outer skin for the purpose of aiding in gripping the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">safety clipper  10</span> , or simply for aesthetics.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]    It is within the contemplated scope of the invention that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">ledge  <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">24</span>  and/or groove  32</span>  features of the present invention may be incorporated into other clipper configurations, both currently known in the art and yet to be designed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0029]    As can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, embodiments of the present invention provide an improved apparatus for safely trimming the nails of young children and infants, and of other persons for whom trimming of fingernails and toenails may be a challenge.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0030]    It should be understood, of course, that the foregoing relates to exemplary embodiments of the invention, and that modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims. The elements of the device may be modified, interchanged, separated or combined, or additional elements added without departing from the spirit of the invention. The invention may be practiced in alternative embodiments other than those illustrated in the Figures. Such modifications, combinations, additions and alternatives are within the contemplation of the present invention. The exemplary embodiments disclosed are not intended to limit the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be determined not by the embodiments illustrated, but by their legal equivalents, and shall be as broad as the claims will allow. </p>
