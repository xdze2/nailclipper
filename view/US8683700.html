                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> An apparatus for cutting toe nails and finger nails includes a plastic frame member. The frame member includes an upper frame member and a lower frame member. The upper and lower frame members are either attached together at a rear thereof or they are formed as a continuous component that generally includes a V-shape or a U-shape at the rear. One of a pair of cutting blades is attached to a front of the upper frame member and a remainder of the pair of cutting blades is attached to a front of the lower frame member so that a cutting edge of each of the pair of cutting blades will be in alignment and face each other. According to certain preferred embodiments, the device is disposable. According to certain other preferred embodiments each of the pair of cutting blades can be replaced with a new replacement blade assembly. A safety bumper prevents injury and provides a means for controlling the finished length of the nail. Various embodiments are shown sufficient to illustrate the benefits of having the plastic frame member align and support the disclosed novel steel blades which are considerably smaller, lighter, and less expensive to manufacture than the steel blades of prior opposing, non-overlapping blade types of nail clippers. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> This application is a continuation in part of currently patent application Ser. No. 11/305,561 and entitled “Nail Clipper with Blade-Insert” that was filed by the same applicants on Dec. 15, 2005, and the applicants claim the benefit of priority of the patent application Ser. No. 11/305,561 which was filed on Dec. 15, 2005.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention, in general, relates to personal grooming devices and, more particularly, to toe and finger nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Nail clippers, the term herein including either toe or finger nail type of clippers, are generally well known.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Nail clippers have certain problems. For example, prior art designs tend to spray the clippings into a room. The clippings may be sharp and can even spread infection. Therefore, it is desirable to contain clippings.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      However, prior art nail clippers include a center post that engages with a pivoting lever. The pivoting lever, pressing upon a ridge in the center post applies pressure to the clipper sufficient to urge a pair of opposite sides, and therefore also the blades, toward one-another during use. This is described in greater detail hereinafter.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The center post, though necessary, provides an obstruction that certain of the clippings inevitably must impact. The clippings bounce off of the center post and are scattered. Any prior art type of modification intended to retain the clippings has proven to be ineffective when they are bouncing off of the center post.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Other prior art types of nail clippers do not fold sufficiently flat for storage. Others do not apply leverage that can create sufficient force to cut through difficult nails without requiring a great deal of force by the user.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Additionally, prior art nail clippers include considerable metal that has been machined. This is considerably more expensive than plastic, for example. However, all prior art designs have heretofore included an all metallic nail clipper if opposing parallel blades are used, with perhaps some plastic surround components as well. This has been expensive to manufacture.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      There is a need for an inexpensive nail clipper. There is a need for a disposable nail clipper that is also inexpensive. Such a device could be given away at finer hotels or sold for minimum cost. It could also be a free item that included advertising, for example.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Nail clippers are expensive because of the machining that is required to manufacture the metal portions thereof. The top and bottom blades must not only be cut to a fine edge, but they must align precisely so as to abut one-another when closed. It is relatively inexpensive to make a blade, but the manufacture of two opposing blades that mesh precisely together and abut each other when closed is what drives up the cost of manufacture of these types of prior art nail clippers. Additionally, each blade includes a remaining portion that forms one-half of a body of the prior art nail clipper. Each prior art blade is formed from a single piece of metal that includes two bends (radiuses) and a blade that has a cutting edge. Accordingly, the cost of manufacture is substantially increased. The construction of this common prior art type of nail clipper is described in greater detail hereinafter.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Also, because nail clippers include so much metal, they are detected at airport security checks and often result in the searching of personal sundries that would not otherwise be so scrutinized. The metallic nail clipper is typically taken away from the owner during a security screening. The owner is then faced with a return to a non-secure area and shipping the nail clipper from the airport, which typically takes over two weeks to arrive or loss of their nail clipper what would otherwise be confiscated by security personnel who have been instructed to view it as a potentially dangerous weapon which, of course, is a debatable assessment. Either way the all metallic nail clipper is likely to be detected and the owner will be without a nail clipper when they arrive at their intended destination.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is desirable that a nail clipper include very little metal so that it does not register as a potential threat during airport check-in procedures. An acceptable amount is similar to the amount of metal found in a few coins, at most. Therefore, the ideal nail clipper would not include significantly more metal than that provided by the cutting blades.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As mentioned briefly before, a very common prior art type of a nail clipper includes a pair of opposing metallic blades that include a right angle radius and a remaining portion that extends to the rear of the nail clipper where the two remaining portions are joined together. Each of the opposing blades typically includes a slight curvature to correspond better with the curvature that most people prefer for their finished nails, although the opposing blades can include a cutting edge that is straight, if desired. A chord taken across the opposite ends of the cutting edge of each opposing blade is generally perpendicular with respect to a longitudinal axis of the remainder of the nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The opposing blades are normally disposed in a parallel and spaced-apart relationship with respect to each other. A connecting post passes through an opening provided in an upper remaining portion. The post is attached to a lower remaining portion. A lever cooperates with an upper end of the post and bears upon an upper surface of the upper remaining portion. As the lever is urged toward the upper remaining portion it applies an upward force to the post and a corresponding downward force to the upper remaining portion that, together, urge the upper remaining portion and the lower remaining portion toward each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As the upper and lower remaining portions are urged together the cutting edges of both opposing blades are also urged toward each other. The cutting edges of the two opposing blades are in a spaced-apart parallel relationship with respect to each other when they are maximally disposed away from each other and they remain in a spaced-apart and parallel relationship with respect to each other as they are urged closer together. When the cutting edges of both of the opposing blades are urged fully toward each other the cutting edges abut each other and are parallel with respect to each other when they are in contact with each other. Accordingly, for this common prior art type of nail clipper the cutting edges of the blades are always parallel with respect to each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      During use a finger nail or a toe nail is disposed between the two opposed blades when the lever is in a fully raised position and the two cutting edges are disposed maximally away from each other. As the two cutting edges are urged toward each other the nail is simultaneously being severed by each of the two cutting edges. Accordingly, the nail is being cut simultaneously on both sides of the nail. An audible snap is typically heard at the moment the nail is severed when the cutting edges of the opposing blades make contact with each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is important to note that this type of prior art nail clipper experiences considerable mechanical stress (i.e., force-loading) as it cuts the nail because cutting is occurring simultaneously across the entire width of the cutting blade and also because cutting is occurring simultaneously on both sides of the nail. This has heretobefore required that the blades in their entirety and interconnecting portions of the prior art nail clipper be formed of steel to withstand the magnitude of the mechanical stresses (i.e., forces) that are experienced.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is useful to consider that prior art types of metallic nail clippers that have a cutting edge which is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the clipper and that cut both sides (top and bottom) of the nail simultaneously actually can be considered as having two elongated blades. Each of the blades can be seen as including a cutting edge that is provided at a forward end of each blade.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As mentioned above, the two elongated blades each include a ninety degree bend proximate the cutting edge and the remaining portion of each cutting blade extends rearward to form the body of the nail clipper. Each of the two remaining portions are joined together at a rear of the remaining portion, often by spot welding or by the use of a fastener, with the cutting edges facing toward each other and disposed in a spaced-apart and parallel orientation. The metallic lever and post, as mentioned above, is used to draw the two cutting edges together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      An inherent spring constant of each remaining portion of the two extended blades is used to supply a force to urge the blades apart. By including a slight rear angle in the remaining portions prior to where the two remaining portions contact each other and are secured together, a distance between the two remaining portions increases from the rear of the nail clipper moving forward toward the cutting edges. By controlling the magnitude of the rear angle the maximum amount of gap between the opposing cutting edges is determined.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Each blade and each remaining portion of each blade is formed of a continuous piece of metal. The post of the prior art type of nail clipper is also formed of metal. Therefore all load bearing components that experience significant loading of these common prior art types of nail clippers are formed entirely of metal. Accordingly, in general the use of metal for these component parts of these prior art types of nail clippers have been the only way to provide the strength that is required to sever the nail across its width simultaneously along both the top and bottom of the nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Therefore, any of the known prior art types of nail clippers that is not formed entirely of metal (for the load-bearing components) or which includes an intermediate portion that is made from plastic or from some other non-metallic material and which supports the cutting blades must use a scissor-type (also known as a shear cut) of cutting action rather than the two opposing blades, as described above, which abut each other in order to withstand the magnitude of forces that are experienced during use. A scissor cut experiences considerably less stress that does the common prior art type of opposing parallel spaced-apart blade nail clipper because the nail is only being severed at a point when a scissor or shear cut is utilized. Severing the nail at a single point requires considerably less force than does severing the nail along the entire width of the nail simultaneously on both sides of nail. Severing the nail simultaneously along its width is a cutting of the nail along a line, either along a straight or a curved line depending on the shape of the cutting blades.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As the nail is continually sheared the point where the nail is being cut moves across the width of the nail, progressing further away from a pair of shear handles that control the shear blades. Therefore, considerably less mechanical stress is experienced by the prior art type of nail clipper utilizing a scissor cut than by the prior art type of nail clipper utilizing parallel opposing blades that cut simultaneously across the entire width of the blades. Because of the lower forces experienced by a scissor cut the prior art use of plastic members that support metal blades for a nail clipper has been possible.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is, of course, possible to include plastic members that support metal blades which may abut each other along their cutting edges for very light duty low-stress cutting applications, but it has not heretobefore been possible to do so for any device intended to cut finger or toe nails. However, there has been a long standing need to provide a nail clipper for use with finger nails and toe nails that includes a body portion formed of a plastic for the reasons mentioned throughout this disclosure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is also useful to note that finger and toe nails can come in various thicknesses and that considerable force can be encountered when simultaneously cutting across the width of the blade and through especially thick nails as can occur, for example, by nails that have been compromised by fungal infection. This can further increase the loading that is experienced by a nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      However, a significant first disadvantage to a shear type of cut as found with any prior art nail clipper that includes a plastic member to support a metallic cutting blade is that a shear includes a wide opening into which a user can over insert the tip of their finger or toe and risk cutting of the fleshy part of the finger tip or tip of the toe during insertion. This problem is especially acute for the visually impaired and for those with other disabilities.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Preventing cutting of the fleshy part of the finger or toe is an important consideration. While prior art types of spaced-apart opposing parallel cutting edge (blade) nail clippers provide some benefit over shear types of nail clippers it is still possible to over insert the nail and cut the fleshy part of the finger or toe. Also, the quality of cut is likely to vary from nail to nail as some nails are likely to be cut shorter while others are cut longer.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      People desire a nail clipper that provides a constant depth of cut from nail to nail for optimum appearance and they want to minimize and preferably eliminate the possibility of cutting the finger. For example, people typically desire that their nails be of equal length after cutting to provide a uniform appearance. Also, people may desire that a predetermined amount of the lighter portion that is common at the tip of the nail to remain after cutting. A type of cut that provides this appearance is commonly referred to as a “French manicure”.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, it is not possible for unskilled users of any type of prior art nail clipper to prevent the possibility of cutting the fleshy tip of the finger or toe and it is not possible to precisely control the depth of cut from nail to nail or provide a French manicure. Therefore, many people pay a manicurist to provide these services. However, this is challenging even to a skilled manicurist and especially so to a manicurist of lesser skill. Even a manicurist could benefit from the use of a nail clipper or set of nail clippers that each include means for controlling the depth of cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A second significant disadvantage to the use of a shear cut (of any prior art device intended for cutting finger/toe nails) is that the user must exert and maintain considerable force at all times while urging the nail in a direction that is toward the intersecting cutting edges of the shear type of nail clipper. This is necessary because as the shear blades are drawn together they create an angle of intersection between the two shear blades that applies a force (i.e., a force vector) to the nail which tends to urge the nail away from the point of intersection as the blades are drawn closer together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In order to cut the nail with a scissor or shear type of cut the user must simultaneously close the shears while supplying a force urging the nail toward the shear blades. This effect is not noticeable when cutting a sheet of paper using paper shears. This is because the paper is easy to cut and thin. Being thin, the shear blades tend to be disposed at a less severe angle at the point of cut than they would if the paper (or object being cut) were thicker. Therefore, a greater percentage of the force applied to the paper by the shears is in a downward direction while less of the force is applied to the paper in a horizontal direction. However, a finger nail or toe nail is considerably harder and thicker than is a sheet of paper. Accordingly, the horizontal force component that is applied to the nail by the shear blades and which tends to urge the finger or toe nail away from the shear blades is considerably greater when cutting finger or toe nails than when cutting through paper with a pair of scissors.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Not only is this difficult to coordinate, but there is considerable risk that the nail could be urged away from a position of contact with the shear blades for any of several possible reasons. If the user is cutting a small amount of finger nail, for example, the small amount of nail could suddenly be severed simply by urging the nail toward the shear blades. The moment the nail is severed an acceleration of the finger will occur that can drive the fleshy part of the finger that is near the nail into the cutting edges of the shear blades. The finger can be cut, perhaps severely so. If the nail is urged away from contact with the shear blades because the user is unsteady, the same risk of cutting the finger arises. While this is difficult for users in general it is especially difficult for those with impaired vision or diminished hand-eye motor control to accomplish. For example, people in hospitals, nursing, and convalescent homes are unable to use shear type nail clippers for these reasons.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, there is a long-standing need to provide a nail clipper with opposing parallel cutting blades that abut each other that is safe to use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Also, there is a long-standing need to provide a nail clipper with opposing parallel cutting blades that abut each other that includes less metal.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Also, in nursing and convalescent homes for the reasons mentioned herein, shears cannot be provided for the residents to trim their own nails, less they injure themselves. However, the prior art nail clippers that include opposing parallel cutting blades that abut each other are too expensive to routinely provide to the residents. Also, it is possible to over-insert a finger into the prior art nail clippers that include opposing parallel cutting blades that abut each other when closed and to cut the fleshy part of the finger. For this reason, the residents are often prevented from cutting their own nails and must rely on assistance from staff to cut their nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Also, due to failing memory, the residents are apt to lose or to leave their own personal nail clippers (typically provided by family members) in community areas. The staff, upon finding such a nail clipper, is often unable to determine the correct owner and is reluctant to guess and provide a found nail clipper to the wrong person because of the risk of spreading viruses, bacteria, and fungal infections.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, there is a need for a low cost nail clipper that includes opposing parallel cutting blades which abut each other that is low in cost. Similarly, there is a need for a nail clipper that includes opposing parallel cutting blades which abut each other that can be readily identified. For example, a plastic body could be provided in a variety of colors or designs to provide a visual means of identification. Similarly, a plastic body of a nail clipper could be written on by the use of a permanent market to identify the owner. Additionally, a plastic body could include Braille markings to identify ownership or any other desired attribute of the nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, there is also a long standing need to provide a means for controlling the depth of cut of a finger (or toe) nail by a nail clipper of the type that includes opposing parallel cutting blades which abut each other. Similarly, there is a need to provide a set of nail clippers that each include means for controlling the depth of cut of a finger (or toe) nail and where each clipper provides a different depth of cut. Additionally, there exists a need to provide a means for indicating the degree of depth of cut on a nail clipper that limits the depth of cut. There is a need to identify the depth of cut of a nail clipper by visual or by tactile means.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, there exists today a need for a nail clipper with blade-insert that helps ameliorate the above-mentioned problems and other difficulties.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Clearly, such an apparatus would be a useful and desirable device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Description of Prior Art  </p>

                        <p>      Briefly, a nail clipper with blade-insert that is constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention has a plastic frame with a pair of cutting blades that are attached to the plastic frame and face each other. A safety bumper is described that controls the depth of cut of a finger or toe nail relative to a fleshy tip of the finger or toe and which helps to prevent cutting of the fleshy part of the finger or toe. If desired, the safety bumper also provides structural support for the cutting blades. According to a preferred embodiment the pair of cutting blades can be replaced with new blades. According to another preferred embodiment, the device is disposable. Various embodiments are shown to illustrate some of versatility and benefits that are possible. All of the embodiments disclosed herein appertain to a general type of nail clipper having a basic structure as defined by the remainder of this paragraph. All embodiments include a pair of opposing blades. Each of the two opposing blades includes a cutting edge. The two cutting edges are identically shaped with respect to each other and face each other. The cutting edges are disposed in a parallel, spaced-apart relationship with respect to each other when the opposing blades are disposed maximally away from each other which occurs when the opposing blades are not being urged toward each other. When a force is applied to urge the opposing blades maximally toward each other each cutting edge will come into contact with and abut the identically-shaped cutting edge of the opposing blade along the length of the cutting edges. The cutting edges of the opposing blades are maintained in parallel relationship with respect to each other when they are disposed maximally away from each other, when they abut each other, and when they are disposed at any intermediate distance between being disposed maximally away from each other and being in contact with each other. A finger nail or toe nail is inserted between the cutting edges when they are disposed maximally away from each other. The cutting edges are then urged toward each other. As the cutting edges are urged toward each other the upper cutting edge begins to sever (i.e., cut) a first side of the nail as the lower cutting edge simultaneously begins to sever an opposite second side of the nail. Increasing force is applied to continue urging the cutting edges toward each other until the opposing cutting edges have simultaneously severed both sides of the nail and have come into contact with one-another along their length. A chord that is taken across the ends of the cutting edges (if the cutting edges are curved) or a line that is parallel to the cutting edges (if the cutting edges are straight) is perpendicular with respect to a longitudinal axis that passes through a main body of any version of the nail clipper with blade-insert.  </p>

                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring  14</span>  is provided to push an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame member  12</span>  away from a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">bottom half  12</span>   b . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring  14</span>  fits into a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">hole  16</span>  provided in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">bottom half  12</span>   b  and a similar hole (not shown) that is provided in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">top half  12</span>   a.     </p>
                    
                        <p>      If desired, a greater amount of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">plastic material  18</span>  (shown in dashed lines) is provided near a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">rear  20</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame member  12</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">plastic material  18</span>  is used instead of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring  14</span>  to urge the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">bottom half  12</span>   b  away from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  when no force is applied to any portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame member  12</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If desired, other types of springs (not shown) can be used.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame member  12</span>  of the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  includes a first enlarged front portion, identified in general by the reference numeral  22 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">The first enlarged front portion  22</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">vertical section  24</span>  that is generally perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a . An <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">inside radius  26</span>  connects the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">vertical section  24</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  along an inside surface of the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> . An <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">outside radius  28</span>  similarly connects the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">vertical section  24</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  along an outside surface of the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">first recess  30</span>  is provided in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">bottom surface  32</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">vertical section  24</span>  that extends across the width thereof. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">first recess  30</span>  can be straight or it may include a curve, as desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  is inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">first recess  30</span>  and is held in place by friction or by any preferred method or combination of methods, as desired. For example, holes (not shown) can be provided through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span> . Plastic material from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">vertical section  24</span>  can extend through the holes sufficient to secure the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  precisely in position. If desired, an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">adhesive  35</span>  may be used.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  includes a small piece of planar material with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  that is disposed closest toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">bottom half  12</span>   b . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  is preferably formed of metal, although other materials, for example a ceramic material, can be used, if desired. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  preferably includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">curvature  38</span>  along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  as is common with prior art types of nail clippers (not shown).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  small piece of planar material is sharpened and bent (if desired) prior to insertion into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">first recess  30</span> . As such, the cost of manufacture of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  is minimal.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">bottom half  12</span>   b  includes a second enlarged front portion, identified in general by the reference numeral  40 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">second enlarged front portion  40</span>  is a mirror in construction and composition to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">first enlarged front portion  22</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second blade  34</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">second enlarged front portion  40</span>  is identical to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span> , just oriented upside down with respect thereto.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second blade  34</span>   a  aligns with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">bottom half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame member  12</span>  are urged together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  are urged toward each other when a force sufficient to overcome hysteresis and the force of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring  14</span>  is applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  in the direction and location of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">arrow  42</span>  and to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">bottom half  12</span>   b  in the direction and location of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">opposite arrow  44</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      When urged together, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  align perfectly with respect to each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A f<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">inger nail ( 324</span>   FIG. 10 ) or a toe nail (not shown) is inserted between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second blade  34</span>   a  (or between the blades of any embodiment) and is severed by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  and by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  when sufficient force is applied to urge the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">bottom half  12</span>   b  toward each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Therefore, as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  are urged toward each other, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">finger nail  324</span>  is being severed on a first side by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">finger nail  324</span>  is also simultaneously being severed on an opposite second side by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a . After sufficient force has been applied (either by hand or by a mechanical advantage supplied by a lever, as described in greater detail hereinafter) the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  are drawn together until they eventually contact each other along the length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a , at which time an outer portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">finger nail  324</span>  will have been severed apart from a remainder of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">finger nail  324</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is important to note that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  abut each other. They do not overlap one-another. Accordingly, there is no shear action that occurs with any embodiment of the instant invention as occurs with a (common) pair of household scissors or shears (not shown). A scissor-cut (i.e., a shear cut) is undesirable for use in cutting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">finger nail  324</span>  (or toenail) for several reasons. If attempting to cut a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">finger nail  324</span>  with a shear-type of cutting action the user must constantly apply a force urging the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">finger nail  324</span>  toward the intersecting (i.e., pivot) point of the shears to counteract a force that the shears are applying to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">finger nail  324</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As the shear blades are drawn together they create a force vector in a direction that is urging the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">finger nail  324</span>  away from the intersecting point. If the user did not apply the counteracting force the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">finger nail  324</span> , being relatively hard, would be urged away from the intersecting point and it would not be severed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Not only is it difficult for the user to apply and maintain the (counteracting) force but there is considerable danger that the position of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">finger nail  324</span>  with respect to the shear blades might suddenly slip. The user could then impact the sharp cutting edges of the shear blades with the fleshy part of the finger. This could result in minor to severe injury (cutting) of the finger.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      There is another significant disadvantage associated with the use of a scissor-type cutting action for severing finger or toe nails. During use shear blades must be opened and disposed at angle with respect to each other. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">fingernail  324</span>  is placed between the shear blades so that it contacts the shear blades near their point of intersection. A significant portion of the shear blades will extend outward beyond the thickness of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">finger nail  324</span>  and along the angle between the shear blades. This provides an opening that is considerably larger than is the thickness of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">finger nail  324</span> . When a slip occurs, the excessive size of the open shear blades permits entry of the finger and contact with the cutting edges of the shear blades by any portion of the finger (or fingers). Therefore, injury can occur to the fingers well beyond the thickness of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">finger nail  324</span> . By way of contrast, only a small opening for insertion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">finger nail  324</span>  is provided by any embodiment of the instant invention. This is described in greater detail, hereinafter.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is noted that all embodiments described herein resemble in some very general ways the structure of a prior art type of nail clipper that includes opposing metal blades and a metal body. As described hereinafter in greater detail, the all-metal construction was required to withstand the forces involved. The disclosure herein overcomes the prior art limitations to allow for construction of the instant invention without the use of metal for the members that extend and support the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blades  34</span> ,  34   a  (or any of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">other blades  106</span> ,  152 ,  202 ,  300 ,  301 , as described herein).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      All embodiments of the instant invention resemble in only these very general ways the prior art all-metal type of nail clipper in that they include <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">two opposing blades  34</span> ,  34   a  with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">each blade  34</span> ,  34   a  having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span> ,  36   a  at an end thereof. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">two cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a  of all embodiments (and the prior art device) face each other. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">two cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a  are either curved or straight but for any given embodiment they are identically shaped with respect to each other. Like the prior art device, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a  are disposed in a parallel, spaced-apart relationship with respect to each other whenever the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">opposing blades  34</span> ,  34   a  are disposed away from each other. When the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">opposing blades  34</span> ,  34   a  of the instant invention (and the prior art device) are urged together the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a  contact one-another along their length. There is no overlap of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a . Therefore, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">two cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a  are always in a parallel relationship with respect to each other for the instant invention (and the prior art device). A chord that is taken across the ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a  (if the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a  are arcuate) or a line that is parallel to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a  (if the cutting edges are straight) is perpendicular with respect to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem514">longitudinal axis  514</span> , ( FIG. 17 ) that passes through a main body of any embodiment of the instant invention (and the prior art device).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring again to  FIG. 1 , typically, a thumb and finger of a user can supply sufficient force to sever the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> . If desired, the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  is modified to include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lever  52</span>  (see  FIG. 2 ) to apply greater force to urge the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  together.  FIG. 2  also illustrates that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">one-piece frame member  12</span>  can be modified to include two pieces, as described in greater detail hereinafter. The use of one or two pieces for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame member  12</span>  is possible for any embodiment of the invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If desired, an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">advertisement  46</span>  is provided wherever preferred on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame member  12</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Because the cost of manufacture is so little for the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> , they can be sold at very low cost, used for a period of time until the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  become dull, and then disposed of.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring  14</span>  is eliminated, other than the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second blade  34</span>   a  there is no metal. Of course, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring  14</span>  could be changed from a coil-type of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring  14</span>  to include a leaf-type of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring  14</span>  that is disposed further toward the rear of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  (not shown) than is the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring  14</span> , as shown. This makes the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  lightweight and very inexpensive to manufacture.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Unlike all known prior art types of nail clippers, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second blade  34</span>   a  are separate parts. They are not formed of a continuous piece of metal (as is the prior art). Because the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second blade  34</span>   a  are not continuous, precision machining of the each prior art cutting edge with respect to the other is eliminated.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This greatly reduces the cost of manufacture because the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second blade  34</span>   a , being separate components, are easy to manufacture and to machine the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a.     </p>
                    
                        <p>      Luxury hotels can provide the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  for free or at low cost. Manufacturers of any type of a product who wish to increase customer awareness of their products (or services) can include their name, telephone number, and website as part of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">advertisement  46</span> . The manufacturers may wish to give the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  away for free.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Every time a person who has received one for free cuts his or her finger nails or toe nails, they are apt to be reminded of the manufacturer and to think favorably of the manufacturer. If repeated enough times, when a purchase decision is required by the person for a product offered by the manufacturer, it is likely that the name of the manufacturer will spring favorably to mind.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame member  12</span>  can be any desired color of plastic. For example, a pink color of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame member  12</span>  may appeal to girls and women whereas another color may be more likely to appeal to boys and men.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Furthermore, because there is so little metal, airport security devices are not likely to detect the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  during security screening. This prevents delays and possible confiscation of the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  by overly zealous security personnel.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now primarily to  FIG. 2  is shown, a second disposable type of a nail clipper with blade-insert, identified in general by the reference numeral  50 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">plastic lever  52</span>  is pivotally attached to a top of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">vertical plastic pin  54</span>  by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">horizontal pin  55</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">pin  54</span>  passes through a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">pin hole  56</span>  provided in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">first modified frame member  58</span> . If desired, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">pin  54</span>  can be formed of a metal or material other than plastic.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">pin  54</span>  continues to pass through a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">second pin hole  60</span>  provided in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">first modified frame member  58</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span>  are identical, just inverted with respect to each other. They are each formed of plastic or nylon preferably and include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">center wedge  64</span>  at an end opposite to where the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">pin  54</span>  is disposed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">pin  54</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">split bottom  54</span>   a . The two opposite sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">split bottom  54</span>   a  are urged together sufficient to pass through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">second pin hole  60</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem65">pin wedge  65</span>  is urged into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">split bottom  54</span>   a  sufficient to spread the two opposite sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">split bottom  54</span>   a  apart an amount sufficient to prevent the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">split bottom  54</span>   a  from passing back up and through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">second pin hole  60</span> . There are, of course, ways of securing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">pin  54</span>  or a modified type of pin (not shown) other than by the use of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">split bottom  54</span>   a.     </p>
                    
                        <p>      <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">The first modified frame member  58</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span>  are preferably planar members that approximate the size of current prior art types of nail clippers. Prior art types of nail clippers come in a variety of sizes and it is to be understood that the instant invention can similarly be provided in a variety of sizes.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">wedge  64</span>  is either welded (by ultrasound or other means) or adhered (by an adhesive) to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">first modified frame member  58</span>  and to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span> . Injection molding or other known or future manufacturing techniques can, of course, be used to form any version of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> ,  50  ( 100 ,  150 ,  200 , as described hereinafter).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">wedge  64</span>  orients the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">first modified frame member  58</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span>  in a spaced apart relationship where they are disposed further apart at a front, identified in general by the reference numeral  66  than at an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">opposite rear  68</span> . If desired, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">wedge  64</span>  is molded as an integral part of the second disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">blade-insert  50</span>  so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">wedge  64</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">first modified frame member  58</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span>  are one continuous piece.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first modified blade  70</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">blade hole  72</span>  through which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">pin  54</span>  passes. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first modified blade  70</span>  includes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  which is substantially identical to that of the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first modified blade  70</span>  is attached at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">front  66</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">first modified frame member  58</span>  by adhesive or any preferred means.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">second modified blade  74</span>  is identical to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first modified blade  70</span>  and is similarly attached in an inverted fashion to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span>  so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">second modified blade  74</span>  are aligned with respect to each other and face each other, as they did on the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      When the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lever  52</span>  is depressed in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">arrow  76</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">fulcrum  78</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">lever  54</span>  applies a mechanical advantage to the top of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">first modified frame member  58</span>  sufficient to urge it toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">pin  54</span>  prevents the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span>  from moving away from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">first modified frame member  58</span>  as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lever  52</span>  is depressed. This causes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">second modified blade  74</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first modified blade  70</span>  to move toward each other until the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  align with each other and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">any finger nail  324</span>  or toe nail placed there-between has been severed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The second disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">blade-insert  50</span>  shares the advantages of being lightweight, inexpensive to manufacture, low cost of purchase, space for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">advertisement  46</span> , and because of little metal, freedom from detection by airport security devices of the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If desired, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem79">retainer clip  79</span>  can be inserted over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">opposite rear  68</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">first modified frame member  58</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">wedge  64</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span>  to secure them together. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem79">retainer clip  79</span>  if formed of metal or any preferred material and can be crimped in place to provide a low-cost manufacturing method.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now primarily to  FIG. 3  is shown a portion of a first half of a third disposable type of a nail clipper with blade-insert, identified in general by the reference numeral  100 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">front portion  102</span>   a  of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">second modified frame member  102</span>  is shown. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">second modified frame member  102</span>  and those portions of the third disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">blade-insert  100</span>  not shown or otherwise described as being different than the previously described embodiments, are substantially the same as with either the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  or, alternately, the second disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">blade-insert  50</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">front portion  102</span>   a  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">horizontal recess  104</span>  into which a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">third modified blade  106</span>  is disposed and attached in any preferred manner. For all embodiments described hereinafter, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  is similarly included. Also, for all embodiments described hereinafter, a bottom half that is not shown includes a mirror image of the top portion which is shown and described. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  will similarly align with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  (of the bottom half) when the bottom half is urged toward the top half (i.e., for example, toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">second modified frame member  102</span> ) that is shown.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The third disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">blade-insert  100</span>  provides the advantages of the previously described embodiments.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now primarily to  FIG. 4  is shown a portion of a first half of a first replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with blade-insert, identified in general by the reference numeral  150 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A replacement blade assembly, identified in general by the reference numeral  152  is shown in a spaced-apart orientation, ready for insertion into an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem154">open end  154</span>  of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem156">third modified frame member  156</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  is similar to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">front portion  102</span>   a  of the third disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">blade-insert  100</span> . However, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  is detachably-attachable with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem156">third modified frame member  156</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem158">tangs  158</span> ,  160  extend from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  and each include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem162">respective beveled leading edge  162</span> ,  164 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem162">Each leading edge  162</span> ,  164  will extend progressively further away from a center of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  as it passes toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">third modified blade  106</span>  until it terminates at a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem166">retaining edge  166</span> ,  168  that are each perpendicular with respect to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem170">arrow  170</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">The replacement blade assemblies  152</span>  are expected to be sold in pairs for replacement of a prior set when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a  of the first replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">blade-insert  150</span>  become dull.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To remove a previously used <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">and now dull replacement blade assembly  152</span>  from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem156">third modified frame member  156</span>  (or bottom member; not shown), a force is simultaneously applied through a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem172">side openings  172</span> ,  174  that are provided in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem156">third modified frame member  156</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem162">two leading edges  162</span> ,  164 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem162">two leading edges  162</span> ,  164  are urged toward each other an amount sufficient to permit the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem166">retaining edges  166</span> ,  168  to clear the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem172">side openings  172</span> ,  174 . The pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem158">tangs  158</span> ,  160  bend inward in response to the force that is applied.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A force in the opposite direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem170">arrow  170</span>  is also simultaneously applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem162">leading edges  162</span> ,  164  are depressed. When the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem166">retaining edges  166</span> ,  168  clear the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem172">side openings  172</span> ,  174 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  is pulled out of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem154">open end  154</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem156">third modified frame member  156</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This is repeated for both the first (top) half of the first replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">blade-insert  150</span>  and also for the second (bottom) half (not shown).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To insert a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">new replacement blade assembly  152</span>  after an older one has been removed, it is simply oriented as shown in the drawing and urged in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem170">arrow  170</span>  until a click is heard as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem166">retaining edges  166</span> ,  168  pass beyond the front edge of each of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem172">side openings  172</span> ,  174 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  is accordingly held in position. Furthermore, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">top replacement blade assembly  152</span>  is aligned with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  (not shown) of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">bottom replacement blade assembly  152</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      An additional benefit is provided over the previous embodiments described herein. The additional benefit is that the first replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">blade-insert  150</span>  can be restored to like-new cutting ability by periodically replacing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assemblies  152</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assemblies  152</span>  are a consumable item, similar to razor blades, which can prove to be as profitable or potentially even more profitable than the sale of the first replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">blade-insert  150</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now primarily to  FIG. 5  and also to  FIG. 6  is shown a portion of a first half of a second replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with blade-insert, identified in general by the reference numeral  200 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">A second replacement blade assembly  202</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204">modified blade  204</span>  that is attached to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206">channel member  206</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204">modified blade  204</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206">channel member  206</span>  are preferably formed of steel. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206">channel member  206</span>  in cross-section ( FIG. 6 ) includes a generally rectangular “C-shape” that is adapted to slide over an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">end  208</span>  of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">fourth modified frame member  210</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">The second replacement blade assembly  202</span>  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">alignment hole  212</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">fourth modified frame member  210</span>  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">alignment protrusion  214</span>  that engages with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">alignment hole  212</span>  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second replacement blade assembly  202</span>  is fully inserted onto an end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">fourth modified frame member  210</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">alignment protrusion  214</span>  disposed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">alignment hole  212</span>  provides two benefits. Together, they ensure that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second replacement blade assembly  202</span>  is fully and properly inserted on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">fourth modified frame member  210</span>  and they help retain the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second replacement blade assembly  202</span>  in position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To ensure that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second replacement blade assembly  202</span>  is not inserted too far onto the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">fourth modified frame member  210</span> , an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem216">elevated ridge  216</span>  is preferably included as part of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">fourth modified frame member  210</span>  that prevents over-insertion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second replacement blade assembly  202</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To remove the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second replacement blade assembly  202</span>  from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">fourth modified frame member  210</span>  it is grasped and sufficient force is applied in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem218">arrow  218</span>  while retaining the remainder of the second replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">blade-insert  200</span> . The resistance provided by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">alignment protrusion  214</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">alignment hole  212</span>  is overcome and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second replacement blade assembly  202</span>  is separated apart from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">fourth modified frame member  210</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To add <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">a new second replacement blade assembly  202</span>  it is urged in a direction opposite that of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem218">arrow  218</span>  until the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">alignment protrusion  214</span>  is in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">alignment hole  212</span>  and a rear edge of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second replacement blade assembly  202</span>  is disposed against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem216">elevated ridge  216</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Of course, when replacement is warranted, two of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">the second replacement blade assemblies  202</span>  are used at both the top and bottom halves of the second replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">blade-insert  200</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      For example, referring now primarily to  FIG. 7  is shown, a fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with blade-insert, identified in general by the reference numeral  250 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">blade-insert  250</span>  is similar to the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> . However, the fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">blade-insert  250</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem252">raised pivot area  252</span>  in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem254">bottom half  254</span>  of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem256">further modified frame member  256</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem256">further modified frame member  256</span>  is preferably formed of plastic or nylon (not metal).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem252">raised pivot area  252</span>  extends across the width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem254">bottom half  254</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span>  is preferably formed of a plastic or nylon and pivots about a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem260">bottom pivot pin  260</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem260">bottom pivot pin  260</span>  passes through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem252">raised pivot area  252</span>  and also through a bottom end of a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem262">opposite lower sides  262</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span>  is similar in design to that which was disclosed in the above-referenced pending patent application.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If desired, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem260">bottom pivot pin  260</span>  can be eliminated and a pair of modified bottom pivot pins (not shown) can instead be provided. The modified bottom pivot pins are each molded as a cylindrical extension to each of the pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem262">opposite lower sides  262</span>  proximate the bottom thereof and extending inward a predetermined distance toward each other. A corresponding cylindrical opening is provided on each side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem252">raised pivot area  252</span>  to receive one of the pair of modified bottom pivot pins.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This can help to lower manufacturing and assembly cost. To assemble the fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">blade-insert  250</span>  when the pair of modified bottom pivot pins are used, the pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem262">opposite lower sides  262</span>  are urged apart an amount sufficient to permit each of the modified bottom pivot pins to enter into the corresponding cylindrical openings in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem252">raised pivot area  252</span> , where they are urged inward by their own elastomeric properties. The modified bottom pivot pins then snap into the cylindrical openings where they are retained.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem262">opposite lower sides  262</span>  (the rear side is not visible) are disposed on opposite sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem256">further modified frame member  256</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span>  includes an opening (as indicated by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem263">bracket  263</span> ) that extends from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem260">bottom pivot pin  260</span>  (i.e., the bottom of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span> ) up to an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem264">upper cross member  264</span> . The opening extends along the length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem262">opposite lower sides  262</span>  as shown by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem263">bracket  263</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem264">upper cross member  264</span>  extends across the width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span>  and when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span>  is urged in the direction shown by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem266">arrow  266</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span>  bears against and urges an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem268">upper half  268</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem256">further modified frame member  256</span>  toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem254">bottom half  254</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blade  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second cutting blade  34</span>   a  are then drawn together sufficient to sever a toe nail or a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">finger nail  324</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem264">upper cross member  264</span>  can extend up to and into a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem270">finger pad  270</span>  or, if preferred, it can extend only partially along the remaining length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span> . For storage, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span>  is pivoted about the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem260">bottom pivot pin  260</span>  in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem272">arrow  272</span>  until it is disposed under the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem254">bottom half  254</span>  and is adjacent thereto.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The only metal used in the fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">blade-insert  250</span>  are for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blade  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second cutting blade  34</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem260">bottom pivot pin  260</span> . Of course, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem260">bottom pivot pin  260</span>  could be made of a material other than metal, if preferred. Also, if the modified bottom pivot pins are used instead of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem260">bottom pivot pin  260</span> , they would not be formed of metal.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, the fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">blade-insert  250</span>  includes all of the advantages of the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  plus the added ease of use that is provided by the mechanical advantage created by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As disclosed, the fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">blade-insert  250</span>  is expected to be used for a period of time and then disposed of. Depending on the quality of construction, the period of time can be less than, equal to, or even longer than that of the known prior-art types of nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      However, if preferred, it can be further modified so that it includes either the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second replacement blade assembly  202</span> , or any other possible type of modified replacement blade assembly (not shown).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      After having had benefit of the instant disclosure, it is anticipated that other and further modifications will be obvious to those possessing ordinary skill.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">first enlarged front portion  22</span>  of the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> , the second disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">blade-insert  50</span> , the third disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">blade-insert  100</span> , or the fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">blade-insert  250</span>  could each be modified, as desired, so as not to be disposable but to include a preferred type of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span> ,  202  (or newly designed).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      For example, any of the disposable types of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  250  can be modified to include the teachings of the first replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">blade-insert  150</span>  ( FIG. 4 ) including a modified replacement blade assembly (not shown).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The modified replacement blade assembly would be similar to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  except that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blade  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second cutting blade  34</span>   a  of the modified replacement blade assembly would be attached vertically (as shown in  FIG. 1  or  FIG. 7 ) instead of horizontally, as shown in  FIG. 4 . This is to illustrate only a small sampling of the many modifications that are now possible regarding the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assemblies  152</span> ,  202 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Similarly, any disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  250  can be modified to include the second replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">blade-insert  200</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Also, any of the versions herein can include any type of an enclosure (not shown) to retain the nail clippings.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      An additional modification could allow replacement of only the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blade  34</span>  instead of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  (or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second replacement blade assembly  202</span> ) which include additional components other than the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blade  34</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">first recess  30</span>  could be modified to secure the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blade  34</span>  in position, allow its withdrawal, and permit the insertion of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">replacement cutting blade  34</span>  therein.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As an example of a possible way to secure the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blade  34</span>  in a modified type of a first recess (not shown), a modified type of a cutting blade (not shown) could include an opening into which a protrusion that is provided in the modified type of a first recess would engage, similar to way in which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">alignment hole  212</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">alignment protrusion  214</span>  cooperate.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The modified type of a cutting blade is grasped and pulled out and another is urged into the modified type of a first recess. This is generally not preferred over use of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assemblies  152</span> ,  202  because of the possibility of injury occurring during removal or insertion of the modified type of a cutting blade into the modified type of a first recess.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to  FIG. 8 , for any version of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250  (including the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">blades  300</span>  and  301 , described in greater detail hereinafter) the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blade  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second cutting blade  34</span>   a  require that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a  contact each other when the device is urged into a closed position. The planar portion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">each cutting blade  34</span> ,  34   a  does not have to be vertical or in parallel planar alignment with each other but could be disposed at an angle, if preferred.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If desired, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blades  34</span> ,  34   a  could be formed of a material other than metal, for example, a ceramic material.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Other changes are also possible. As is well-known in the nail clipper arts, a radius is included in the cutting edges to provide a curvature to the nails (either toe or finger) when cut. Prior art designs machine the curvature into the cutting edges. However, with any version of the instant invention, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blades  34</span> ,  34   a  can be formed of a flat material stock, if preferred, that is bent to provide the desired amount of curvature during assembly. This provides even lower cost for the manufacture of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blades  34</span> ,  34   a.     </p>
                    
                        <p>      If preferred, any portion of any version of the instant invention as described herein that is formed of a plastic, nylon, or polymer, for example, can include either a solid core or a hollow core. Proper selection of materials and skillful design will, of course, allow minimal use of the plastic, nylon, or polymer. Not only does minimal use reduce manufacturing cost, it also reduces weight, which in turn, can substantially reduce shipping costs. This is especially true when compared with the known prior-art. Also, a lower weight makes portage of the instant invention easier to accomplish, whether it is placed in a pocket, purse, or added to a keychain, for example.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to  FIGS. 9 ,  10 , and  11  a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">modified blade  300</span>  is shown that is similar to that shown in  FIG. 5  and  FIG. 6 . As shown in  FIG. 9  the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">modified blade  300</span>  is flat. It has been stamped from low cost flat steel stock. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">modified blade  300</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edge  302</span>  that has been provided (machined or ground) in the flat steel stock at an end of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">blade extension portion  304</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edge  302</span>  for any embodiment of the invention can include, as desired, a “V-shape” as shown in  FIG. 10  and  FIG. 11  or it can be tapered from one edge only as shown for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  of  FIG. 1 ,  FIG. 2 ,  FIG. 3 ,  FIG. 4 ,  FIG. 5 ,  FIG. 7 , and  FIG. 8 . Similarly, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">any cutting edge  302</span> ,  36 ,  36   a  can be straight or curved, as desired. If a curvature is desired, it is preferably introduced during machine forming (i.e., machining) of any desired type of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span> ,  34   a ,  106 ,  204 ,  300 , (and  301 , as described below). <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem306"> </p>
                    
                        <p>      Dashed lines  306</span> ,  308 ,  310 , and  312  indicate lines about which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">modified blade  300</span>  is bent quickly and inexpensively by machine to fit around an end of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem314">plastic modified member  314</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">modified blade  300</span>  is bent downward (with respect to  FIG. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem306">9 ) along dashed lines  306</span> ,  308 ,  310 , and  312  to surround the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem314">modified member  314</span>  and secure the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">modified blade  300</span>  thereto.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">blade extension portion  304</span>  is bent upward, with respect to the view that is shown in  FIG. 9 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem316">along dashed line  316</span>  to provide a finished shape to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">modified blade  300</span>  as shown in  FIG. 10 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If desired, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">blade extension portion  304</span>  is lengthened to provide a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem305">lengthened blade extension portion  305</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem305">The lengthened blade extension portion  305</span>  is bent downward, with respect to the view that is shown in  FIG. 9 , to provide a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem301">further modified blade  301</span> , as shown in  FIG. 11  for attachment to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem318">standard plastic member  318</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem318">standard plastic member  318</span>  is similar to the member shown in  FIG. 5  in that no portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem318">plastic member  318</span>  protrudes beyond the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edge  302</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem301">further modified blade  301</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In  FIG. 10 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem314">modified member  314</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  that extends forward of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edge  302</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">blade extension portion  304</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  creates a safety bumper that prevents injury to the user and which determines the cut length of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> , as explained in greater detail hereinafter. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  can include any desired length forward of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">blade extension portion  304</span>  and it can include any desired shape or profile. See  FIGS. 1 ,  2 ,  7 , and  8  which show the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  on the top and bottom portions of each embodiment that is shown. See also  FIGS. 12 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 , and  17 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring again to  FIG. 10 , a fleshy part of a tip of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem322">finger  322</span>  contacts the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  and limits how far the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  can be inserted under the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edge  302</span> . The distance from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edge  302</span>  to the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  is shown by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem326">arrow  326</span> . This, in turn, limits the amount of material that can be removed from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> . Therefore, a means is provided for controlling a depth of cut of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> . By varying the length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  the means for controlling a depth of cut of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  is able to provide any desired depth of cut of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem328">slight inward concavity  328</span>  of the fleshy portion of the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem322">finger  322</span>  is shown in  FIG. 10 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem328">inward concavity  328</span>  occurs in response to the force applied by the user tending to urge the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem322">finger  322</span>  toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edge  302</span> . The amount of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem328">inward concavity  328</span>  varies only slightly over a reasonably wide range of forces that the user may apply. However, from a practical point of view the user will not apply so much force that it feels uncomfortable. Rather, the user will tend to apply a force that is nearly the same <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem322">for all fingers  322</span> , which will result in a uniform depth of cut for all fingers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      By limiting the amount the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  can be inserted into any version of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250  the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  extending beyond the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> edge  302</span>  (or  36</span> ,  36   a ) provides the safety bumper that controls the depth of cut of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  and significantly reduces the risk of over-inserting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  and cutting any of the fleshy part of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem322">finger  322</span>  in the process. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span> , which extends forward of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edge  302</span> , is the safety bumper which prevents over-insertion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  and it also prevents accidental cutting of the fleshy part of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem322">finger  322</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, the safety bumper is provided which increases safety when using a type of nail clipper that includes parallel opposed blades that are urged together and abut each other when fully closed. This permits use by visually impaired people and by those with other disabilities that otherwise would be unable to cut their <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">own nails  324</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If is, of course, understood that  FIG. 10  and  FIG. 11  only show a portion of one side of a desired nail clipper and that the remaining opposite side that is not shown would be a mirror image of the side that is shown and that both sides would be attached together at a distal end, thereof, (i.e., to the right of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem314">modified member  314</span>  of  FIG. 10  and to the right of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem318">standard plastic member  318</span>  of  FIG. 11 ) or formed of a continuous piece. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edge  302</span>  of the remaining opposite side that is not shown is always parallel with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edge  302</span>  that is shown and the two cutting edges would align and abut each other without overlap during use when they were urged together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to original drawing  FIGS. 1 ,  2 ,  7 , and  8  the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusions  320</span>  of each FIG. have a different length which, accordingly, provides for a different depth of cut (i.e., length of the cut nail). The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusions  320</span>  can also have any desired shape. Therefore, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusions  320</span>  as shown in  FIGS. 1 ,  2 ,  7 ,  8 ,  10 , 12 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 , &amp;  17  indicate some of the shapes and design configurations that are possible. Other shapes for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  are also anticipated.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now first to  FIG. 2 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusions  320</span>  of the second disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">blade-insert  50</span>  include the smallest distance of any shown from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  or from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  (which is the equivalent of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edge  302</span>  of  FIG. 10 ) to the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  (comparable with that shown by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem326">arrow  326</span>  of  FIG. 10 , though not equivalent in actual magnitude). The shortest possible distance from the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  provides a maximum amount of depth of cut of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  while still providing some limitation as to how far the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  can be inserted beyond the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a . This reduces the risk of injury (of cuts) while still providing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">shortest possible nail  324</span>  length after cutting.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring next to  FIG. 1 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusions  320</span>  of the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  include a slightly greater distance from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  (or from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a ) to the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  than that of the second disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">blade-insert  50</span> . By providing a slightly greater distance from the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span> , the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  provides a slightly reduced magnitude for the depth of cut of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  by slightly further limiting the amount that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  can be inserted beyond the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a . This results in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">slightly longer finished nail  324</span>  length after cutting while further reducing the risk of cutting any of the flesh.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring next to  FIG. 7 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusions  320</span>  of the fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">blade-insert  250</span>  include a second greater distance from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  (or from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a ) to the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  than that of the first or second disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> ,  50 . By providing a slightly greater distance from the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span> , the fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">blade-insert  250</span>  provides a second even further reduced magnitude for the depth of cut of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  that that provided by the first or second disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> ,  50 . This, in turn, provides an even greater second increased limitation as to how far the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  can be inserted beyond the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a . This results in an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">even longer finished nail  324</span>  length after cutting and added safety. If it is sufficiently long and can leave some of the naturally occurring white portion of certain people&#39;s finger nails it would be capable of providing a “natural” type of French manicure cut to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to  FIG. 8 , which can be used with any version of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250 ,  400 ,  500  including use of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">blades  300</span>  and  301  the distance from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusions  320</span>  as shown in  FIG. 8  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a  is the greatest of any as shown in  FIG. 1 ,  2 ,  7 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">or  8</span> . Therefore, an even greater distance from the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  (or to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a ) provides a still further reduced magnitude for the depth of cut of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  which results in an even longer finished length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  after cutting. This can provide even greater safety and length for the natural French manicure cut to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Any style or version of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250 ,  400 ,  500  can be provided with any length for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span> . It is anticipated that most users will select a preferred version with a preferred length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span> . It is also anticipated that a plurality of any style or version of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250 ,  400 ,  500  will be provided with progressively increasing lengths for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  and marketed individually and as a set. This permits individuals who purchase the set to cut their own nails to any desired length. They can even give themselves a natural French manicure. Manicurists are also expected to purchase the set to more easily provide consistent nail length or French manicures for their customers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring again momentarily to  FIG. 10  a series of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem330">Braille markings  330</span>  are included as surface irregularities provided on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem314">modified member  314</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem330">Braille markings  330</span>  can be used to identify the depth of cut (which is inversely proportional to the length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span> ) or to provide any other desired information, such as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper&#39;s  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250 ,  400 ,  500  color.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The safety bumper (i.e., the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span> ) controls the depth of cut. Accordingly, the instant invention provides the only known type of nail clipper that includes means for positively controlling (i.e., limiting) the depth of cut possible for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> . The instant invention, thereby, provides the only known type of nail clipper that positively controls and limits the amount of material that can be cut (i.e., removed) from a nail and in this way it determines how long the finished nail will be after it has been cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is important to note that the maximum permissible depth of cut (the amount of material that is removed from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> ) is relative to the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem322">finger  322</span>  of the user. That means that after the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  has been cut, even if the user attempts to again cut the same <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  using the same nail clipper (any embodiment thereof that includes the safety bumper [i.e., the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span> ]), then a repeated attempt at cutting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  will not remove anymore additional material because the nail clipper will be blocked (i.e., prevented) from being urged closer toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  by the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem322">finger  322</span> . Accordingly, additional material cannot be removed (i.e., cut) from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  even if the user makes additional attempts to do so.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As briefly noted, there will typically be little variation in the finished length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  after cutting between different users who use the same length safety bumper (i.e., <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span> ). This is because the depth of the fleshy portion extending over the bone at the tip of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem322">most fingers  322</span>  does not vary significantly between most people. Also, as previously mentioned, the user will not apply so much force as to feel discomfort in contacting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span> . If each user applies a consistent force when cutting their <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nails  324</span> , then all of their <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nails  324</span>  will be of nearly the same length after cutting.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If one user were to consistently apply a greater force than does another user apply when using any embodiment of the disclosed nail clipper with safety bumper, and if the greater force results in creating <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem328">a consistently deeper inward concavity  328</span> , then for any given finished length of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  that is desired the one user who applies the greater force would purchase and use a version of the instant nail clipper that included a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">longer protrusion  320</span>  (i.e., a longer safety bumper) than would the other user to obtain an equivalent finished length of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  after cutting relative to the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem322">finger  322</span>  of each user.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is desirable to include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem332">visible indication  332</span>  of the l<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem326">ength ( 326</span> ) of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem332">visible indication  332</span>  can provide in millimeters or other units an expected finished (i.e., cut) length for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  or it can be used to indicate the length of the naturally occurring white portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> . Preferably, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem332">visible indication  332</span>  is provided in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem314">plastic modified member  314</span>  or in any plastic member of any version of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250 ,  400 ,  500   318  during manufacture. All preferred versions of the invention include plastic member(s) or nylon or polymer member(s) for supporting the (metal or ceramic) blades and most designs can be modified to include the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">safety bumper (protrusion  320</span> ). Raised molded or printed text indicates the expected length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">finished nail  324</span>  after it has been cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The finished length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  would preferably include an average length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  taken from a sampling of users indicating what most users will obtain for any given length of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  (i.e., for any given length of the safety bumper). This provides an excellent starting point for the user to select and purchase a desired version of the instant nail clipper that includes the safety bumper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If, however, the user tends to be especially light in applying force then the user may need a version of the nail clipper having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">shorter protrusion  320</span>  than average. As mentioned above, if the user tends to be especially heavy in applying force then the user may need a version of the nail clipper having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">longer protrusion  320</span>  than average.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      There are many possible ways of providing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem332">visual indication  332</span> . If desired, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem332">visible indication  332</span>  can include a color-coding scheme whereby a particular color or pattern of colors for the plastic member(s) or for a portion of the plastic member(s) of any desired version of the instant invention is indicative of the length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  (or any other desired information).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem332">visual indication  332</span>  includes raised markings of any sort, then the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem332">visual indication  332</span>  would also provide a tactile indication of the length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  (or other information). It is to be understood that the length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  is directly proportional to and thereby indicative of the cut length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      By including Braille markings in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem314">plastic modified member  314</span>  or in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem318">standard plastic member  318</span>  (or in the plastic member(s) of any version) when they are formed or molded), the instant invention provides the only known type of nail clipper that controls the amount of material that can be cut (i.e., removed) from a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  (i.e., how long the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">cut nail  324</span>  will be) and which is able to inform the blind or visually impaired person what the expected finished length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  will be before use of any version of the nail clipper that includes the safety bumper. This allows the blind or visually impaired to more precisely groom their <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nails  324</span>  to a particular standard of length and to do so without assistance.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to  FIG. 12 , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem350">forward projecting blade  350</span>  is shown embedded in the forward end of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem352">plastic member  352</span> . Only a portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem352">plastic member  352</span>  is shown. It is understood that a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem354">curved cutting edge  354</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem350">projecting blade  350</span>  will abut a mirror-image of the structures that are shown in the actual completed nail clipper. If preferred, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">straight cutting edge  302</span> ,  36 ,  36   a  could be used instead of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem354">curved cutting edge  354</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  extends forward of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem350">projecting blade  350</span>  to prevent over-insertion of the tip of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem322">finger  322</span>  (for safety) and to control the finished length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">cut nail  324</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring briefly to  FIG. 13 , an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem360">embedded blade  360</span>  includes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">straight cutting edge  302</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem360">embedded blade  360</span>  extends out of the forward end of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem362">square-end plastic member  362</span> . Accordingly, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edge  302</span>  would be disposed forward of any portion of the nail clipper that is completed by extending the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem362">square-end plastic member  362</span>  to the rear and including a mirror image underneath. This version would not provide a safety bumper because it would not include the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>        FIG. 14 , illustrates a way to include the safety bumper by a slight modification made to the structure of  FIG. 13 . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem370">modified protrusion  370</span>  extends forward of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edge  302</span>  and therefore, provides the safety bumper. As previously described herein for other possible embodiments, by controlling the distance that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem370">modified protrusion  370</span>  extends in front of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edge  302</span> , the length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">finished nail  324</span>  can similarly be controlled.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      By providing an additional quantity of plastic in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem370">modified protrusion  370</span>  that extends downward and which contacts the upper surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem360">embedded blade  360</span>  across its width, additional reinforcement is provided that improves strength and rigidity of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem360">embedded blade  360</span> . Accordingly, the resultant safety bumper that is provided by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem370">modified protrusion  370</span>  also provides an unexpected additional benefit of strengthening the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem360">embedded blade  360</span> . This helps to prevent flexing and possible loosening of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem360">embedded blade  360</span>  during use, especially when <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">cutting very thick or hard nails  324</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This illustrates how by modifying the shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span> , it is possible to provide the safety bumper as well as additional reinforcement for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem360">embedded blade  360</span> . Additional modification continuing these teachings will allow for inclusion of the safety bumper and a method for controlling the length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">cut nail  324</span>  for use with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blades  34</span> ,  34   a ,  300 ,  350 ,  360  in any version of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250 ,  400 ,  500 . If the blade itself blocks forward extension of the plastic member (See  FIG. 5  and  FIG. 11 ) the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem320">protrusion  320</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem370">modified protrusion  370</span>  can be included by extending the plastic forward around the sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204">modified blade  204</span> ,  301  or over the top of the blades.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring momentarily to  FIG. 3 , the top of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">front portion  102</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">second modified frame member  102</span>  can be extended forward to pass a predetermined desired distance forward of the plane of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">third modified blade  106</span>  and forward of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  to provide a further modified type of a protrusion (not shown) and, therefore, to provide the safety bumper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring momentarily to  FIG. 4 , the plastic surrounding the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">third modified blade  106</span>  can similarly be extended forward, as desired, to provide the further modified type of the protrusion and safety bumper for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to  FIG. 15 , is shown a further modified nail clipper identified in general by the reference numeral  400  that is somewhat similar to that as previously shown and described in  FIG. 2 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">further modified nail clipper  400</span>  includes a pair of upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem402">lower plastic members  402</span> ,  404  that are each attached together along a rear portion, identified by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">bracket  400</span>   a . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">rear portions  400</span>   a  are joined together by fusion (heat, ultrasound, etc.), adhesive, or mechanical fastener, as desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem406">small angle  406</span>  is preferably included between the plane of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">main body  400</span>   b  and the plane of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">rear portion  400</span>   a  of at least one and preferably both the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem402">plastic members  402</span> ,  404  to introduce an offset that, when fastened together supplies a force sufficient to urge the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">modified blades  300</span>  apart when they are not, otherwise, being urged toward each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The use of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">modified blades  300</span>  illustrates how the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem370">modified protrusion  370</span>  can be varied slightly and used to create the safety bumper, limit the depth of cut of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> , and provide additional structural support for different types of blades.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      An unexpected and significant improvement in the manufacture of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">further modified nail clipper  400</span>  (as well as any version that includes separate upper and lower members) is provided by these structures. By separately manufacturing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem402">plastic members  402</span> ,  404  and providing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">modified blades  300</span>  in a flat orientation ( FIG. 9 ), the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">modified blades  300</span>  can be quickly bent by machine to fit around the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem402">plastic members  402</span> ,  404  and abut the portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem370">modified protrusion  370</span>  that provides additional support to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem304">blade extension portion  304</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Because it is important to ensure proper alignment of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edges  302</span>  in the finished device, after the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">modified blades  300</span>  have been attached to each of the pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem402">plastic members  402</span> ,  404 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem402">plastic members  402</span> ,  404  are then properly oriented with respect to each other so as to ensure that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edges  302</span>  align. This may cause a slight forward or rearward displacement and offset to occur between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">two rear portions  400</span>   a . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">two rear portions  400</span>   a  are then fused (or otherwise attached) together. This ensures proper alignment of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edges  302</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      After attachment, if desired, a distal end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">rear portions  400</span>   a  can be trimmed to provide a flush, or more even appearance. If desired, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem79">retainer clip  79</span>  or a modification thereof can be placed over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">rear portions  400</span>   a  to secure the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem402">plastic members  402</span> ,  404  together or as a covering over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">rear portions  400</span>   a  to improve the aesthetics of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">further modified nail clipper  400</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      For any version of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250 ,  400 ,  500  (see below), if desired, a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem408">opposing inner bumpers  408</span> ,  410  (shown in dashed lines to indicate their optional inclusion) can be added. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem408">inner bumpers  408</span> ,  410  can be molded into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem402">plastic members  402</span> ,  404  or attached, for example, by an adhesive. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem408">inner bumpers  408</span> ,  410  include a combined height that causes them to come in contact with one-another at approximately the same time that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">two opposing cutting edges  302</span>  come in contact with each other. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem408">inner bumpers  408</span> ,  410  can be set to contact each other slightly before or slightly after the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edges  302</span>  contact one-another.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is generally preferred that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem408">inner bumpers  408</span> ,  410  each include the same height. This would continue to allow the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem402">plastic members  402</span> ,  404  to be manufactured as an identical assembly which would reduce manufacturing parts inventory and the overall cost of manufacturing. If desired, one of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem408">inner bumpers  408</span> ,  410  could be made so that it was longer than the other providing the combined length of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem408">the two different height inner bumpers  408</span> ,  410  resulted in contact at about the same time that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edges  302</span>  contacted each other. If desired, only one of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem408">inner b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem410">umpers (either  408</span>  or  410</span> ) could be included and the other omitted providing <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem408">the length for o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem410">ne inner bumper (either  408</span>  or  410</span> ) was equal to the combined overall length of both of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem408">inner bumpers  408</span> ,  410 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem408">inner bumpers  408</span> ,  410  provide a limit or “stop” that limits or prevents a further urging of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem402">plastic members  402</span> ,  408  toward each other. This prevents the user from inadvertently possibly applying an excessive amount of force to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lever  52</span>  after the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edges  302</span>  have come into contact with each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Absent the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem408">inner bumpers  408</span> ,  410 , if an excessive amount of force was applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lever  52</span>  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edges  302</span>  were abutting, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">inner fulcrum  78</span>  would continue to displace the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem402">plastic members  402</span> ,  404  closer toward each other. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">abutting cutting edges  302</span>  cannot move closer together. Therefore, a portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem402">plastic member  402</span>  that is disposed underneath the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">fulcrum  78</span>  and a portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem404">opposite plastic member  404</span>  proximate a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem412">bottom end  412</span>   a  of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem412">modified pin  412</span>  would begin to distort as they were urged closer toward each other. This would subject the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem402">plastic members  402</span> ,  404  to excessive strain and to possible breakage. The extra pressure could also dull or otherwise damage the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edges  302</span>  and, if severe-enough, the distortion could offset the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edges  302</span>  and cause an overlap of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302">cutting edges  302</span>  to occur. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem408">inner bumpers  408</span> ,  410  prevent these adverse conditions from occurring.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If desired, for any embodiment the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem402">plastic members  402</span> ,  404  could, of course, be formed (molded) as a single piece (See  FIG. 1 ,  FIG. 7 , and  FIG. 16 .) Also, if desired, any preferred type of elastomer could be included to provide a force to urge the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">opposing blades  34</span> ,  34   a  apart. For example, an oval shaped elastomer could be inserted and retained in an opening that is provided proximate a rear of any version of the instant invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to  FIG. 16  and also to  FIG. 17  is shown a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem500">hinged nail clipper  500</span>  that includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem502">left member  502</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem504">right member  504</span>  that are formed of a plastic and which are connected by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem506">flexible plastic hinge  506</span> . The left and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem502">right members  502</span> ,  504  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem506">hinge  506</span>  are formed together by injection molding or by any other preferred method. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem504">right member  504</span>  is shown as including the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  embedded in an end thereof and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem502">left member  502</span>  is shown as including the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second blade  34</span>   a  embedded in an end thereof, although any of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">blades  106</span> ,  204 ,  300 ,  301  could be used.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem504">right member  504</span>  includes a securing and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem508">aligning pin  508</span>  that extends upward. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem502">left member  502</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem510">pin opening  510</span>  for receiving the securing and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem508">aligning pin  508</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      After molding and attachment of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blades  34</span> ,  34   a  the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem504">right member  504</span>  is rotated in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem512">arrow  512</span> . When the securing and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem508">aligning pin  508</span>  enters the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem510">pin opening  510</span>  additional force is applied to urge it fully therein. Friction is used to maintain the securing and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem508">aligning pin  508</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem510">pin opening  510</span> . Alternately, an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem508">enlarged tip  508</span>   a  is provided at the end of the securing and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem508">aligning pin  508</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem510">correspondingly-shaped enlarged opening  510</span>   a  is provided at the bottom of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem510">pin opening  510</span>  to provide a mechanical latch that retains the securing and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem508">aligning pin  508</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem510">pin opening  510</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If desired, a preferred type of lever (similar to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lever  52</span> ) and a preferred type of pin (similar to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">pin  54</span> ) can also be added to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem500">hinged nail clipper  500</span> .  FIG. 17  shows the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem500">hinged nail clipper  500</span>  in an assembled and ready-to-use condition after the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem504">right member  504</span>  has been fully urged in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem512">arrow  512</span> . By molding the left and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem502">right members  502</span> ,  504  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem506">hinge  506</span>  as a one-piece assembly the cost of manufacturing can be reduced. The use of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem506">hinge  506</span>  facilitates rotation and final assembly, thereby further lowering the cost of manufacture.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As mentioned, any preferred or desired type of plastic can be used including clear (transparent or semi-transparent) types of plastic as well as scented or other types of plastic, as desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is understood that any of the embodiments disclosed herein including the modifications or variations made thereto can, of course, be further modified to produce additional variations or embodiments not necessarily disclosed herein but which would fall under the design purview of those possessing ordinary skill in the art after having had benefit of the instant disclosure in order to provide a desired combination of attributes, features and benefits.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">modified blades  300</span>  can be used with the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  of  FIG. 1  or with the fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">blade-insert  250</span>  of  FIG. 7  if the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">one-piece plastic frame member  12</span>  (or if the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem256">modified frame member  256</span> ) is desired as the interconnecting body that supports the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">modified blades  300</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is useful to summarize what occurs during use of any version or possible embodiment of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250 ,  400 ,  500 . This helps to differentiate the instant invention from other types of nail clippers (not shown) and to better illustrate the benefits that are provided. Every version of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250 ,  400 ,  500  severs a portion of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  that is disposed between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302  in an identical way when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">opposing blades  34</span> ,  34   a ,  300 ,  301  are progressively urged toward each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To expand upon what was described earlier, the simultaneous cutting of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  that occurs on both sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  begins after the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">opposing cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302  have made their initial contact with opposite sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> . As the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302  are drawn closer together a first cut begins to develop along an upper surface or upper side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> . Simultaneously, a second cut begins to form along an opposite lower surface or lower side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> . The first cut and the second cut are in alignment with respect to each other and are simultaneously forming on opposite sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blades  34</span> ,  34   a ,  300 ,  301  are progressively urged closer together the depth of the first cut and of the second cut continue to deepen progressively further into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> . This is occurring simultaneously for both the first cut and the second cut. The width of the first cut and the width of the second cut cannot exceed the width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302 . However, if the width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  is only slightly greater than the width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302  the portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  that is to be removed may be completely severed from the remainder of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  even though the width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302  is less than the width of the portion that is being removed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This is because the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302  include a thickness dimension that is preferably kept as small as possible. Therefore, as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302  enter into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  a force is applied by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  that is tending to urge the portion that is being removed away from the remainder of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> . This force may be sufficient to sever the portion that is being removed even if it includes a width that slightly exceeds the width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302 . If it is not sufficient, then the process (cycle) is repeated by carefully positioning the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250 ,  400 ,  500  before making an additional upper cut and an additional lower cut to ensure that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302  align with and thereby extend the first cut and the second cut a sufficient amount to fully sever the portion that is being removed from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The width of the first cut and of the second cut can also be limited by the width of the portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  that is disposed between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302 . If only a small portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  is disposed between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302  and if the small portion is less than the width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302 , then the width of the first cut and the width of the second cut will, of course, be limited to the width of the small portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As the simultaneous progressive deepening of the first cut and of the second cut continue, eventually the first cut and the second cut will intersect. When that occurs the o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">pposing cutting edges ( 36</span>  and  36   a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem302"> or  302</span>  and  302 ) will contact each other along the entire length (either linear or curved) of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302 . When the first cut and the second cut intersect and contact between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">opposing cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302  occurs, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302  will abut one-another. There is no overlapping of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302  that occurs. Therefore, cutting of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  does not occur by an overlapping shear type of cutting action or by an overlapping scissor-type of cutting action.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Therefore, a cutting of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  by use of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250 ,  400 ,  500  does not begin at a point on a first side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  and progress toward an opposite second side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span> , as would occur with a scissor or shear type of cut. This is because a point of intersection that occurs between a pair of overlapping scissor or shear blades progresses in a linear direction as the scissor or shear blades are progressively pivoted from a fully open position into a fully closed position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      All embodiments of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250 ,  400 ,  500  include a type of cutting action that occurs simultaneously across the width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      When the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a    302  are in contact with each other (i.e., when the first cut and the second cut have intersected) this position represents a closed state of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250 ,  400 ,  500 . Conversely, when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302  are disposed maximally apart from each other the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250 ,  400 ,  500  is disposed in an open state.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The portion of the nail to be removed is severed when the first cut and the second cut intersect. Just prior to the intersection of the first cut and the second cut, the force tending to urge the portion that is being removed away from the remainder may be sufficient to urge the portion that is being removed sufficiently far away from the remainder of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem324">nail  324</span>  as to finish severing of the nail a moment before the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302  actually come into contact with and abut each other. The sudden drop in resistance causes an acceleration of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">two cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a ,  302  to occur as they move toward each other. When contact occurs an audible snap may, at times, be heard.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Also, as all versions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250 ,  400 ,  500  accomplish the desired cutting action by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">two opposing blades  34</span> ,  34   a ,  106 ,  152 ,  202 ,  300 ,  301  there is no need for the inclusion of any additional cutting blade. Accordingly, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250 ,  400 ,  500  does not include any additional cutting blades that are used or otherwise attached to it other than the first cutting blade and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second cutting blade  34</span> ,  34   a ,  106 ,  152 ,  202 ,  300 ,  301 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The invention has been shown, described, and illustrated in substantial detail with reference to the presently preferred embodiment. It will be understood by those skilled in this art that other and further changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention which is defined by the claims appended hereto. </p>
