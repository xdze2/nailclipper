                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> The cover for a nail clipper is made of plastic and is mounted over the cutting end of the nail clipper. The cover is movable from a position shielding the jaws of the nail clipper to a position permitting access to the jaws of the nail clipper. The cover includes a front wall to shield the jaws in the first position and an opening to provide access to the jaws of the second position. Shoulders are provided on the upper ends of the side walls to define a stop for abutting the nail clipper in the second position. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> This invention relates to a cover for a nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As is known, various types of nail clippers have been constructed with guards to prevent accidental cuts from sharp edges. Typically, such nail clippers include a pair of elongated bars which are secured together at one end and which carry sharp jaws at the opposite end for the clipping of nails. When exposed, the sharp jaws may inadvertently cut or nick the skin of a person handling the nail clipper. In addition, if placed in a pocket or purse in an unexposed condition, the sharp jaws may damage other articles in the pocket or purse. Accordingly, various attempts have been made to provide covers or guards or such nail clippers, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,788,768.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      However, the various attempts to provide a shield or cover over the sharp jaws of a nail clipper have been rather cumbersome or require relatively complex manufacturing and/or assembling techniques.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a cover for a nail clipper of relatively simple construction.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is another object of the invention to provide a cover for a nail clipper which can be readily mounted on a nail clipper during assembly.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is another object of the invention to provide a cover of relatively compact construction for mounting over the cutting end of a nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Briefly, the invention provides a cover which can be disposed over one end of a nail clipper to enclose a pair of cutting jaws at the end of the nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The cover is constructed with a pair of side walls disposed in spaced apart relation, a front wall connecting the side walls together and a rear wall connecting the side walls together and disposed opposite the front wall to define a hollow space for receiving the forward cutting end of the nail clipper. The cover also has a pair of shoulders, each of which is disposed on an upper end of a respective side wall to project into the space between the side walls to define a stop for abutting the forward end of the nail clipper disposed therein.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The cover is particularly constructed to cooperate with a nail clipper having a pair of elongated bars secured together at one end with each bar having a jaw at an opposite end in facing relation to a jaw on the other bar as well as means for moving the jaws relative to each other. In this embodiment, the cover is connected to the nail clipper to move between a first position shielding the jaws and a second position exposing the jaws for use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      When the cover is in the first position, the front wall faces the jaws of the nail clipper. In addition, the cover has an opening above the front wall for alignment with the jaws in the second position of the cover to provide access to the jaws. The cover also has a second opening at the bottom for expelling nail clippings from within the cover after the nail clipper has been put to use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The nail clipper may be constructed with a post secured to one of the bars and passing through the other of the bars. In this embodiment, the rear wall of the cover is disposed between the bars on the side of the post remote from the front wall in order to maintain the cover on the nail clipper. In this respect, the rear wall is of less height than the front wall.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In addition to the shoulders on the sidewalls which define a stop for abutting one of the bars of the nail clipper in the second position of the cover, the front wall has a shoulder at a lower end which projects towards the rear wall in order to define a stop for abutting the other bar of the nail clipper in the first position of the nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The cover may be made of any suitable material; however, a plastic is a preferred material for example for purposes of economy and for softness of material to avoid sharp edges.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      These and other objects and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:  </p>

                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to FIG. 1, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> is constructed in a conventional manner and need not be described in detail. For example, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> includes a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> elongated bars 11</span>, each of which is secured to the other at one end as by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> rivet 12</span>. In addition,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> each bar 11</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> jaw 13</span> at an opposite end disposed in spaced facing relation to a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> jaw 13</span> on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> other bar 11</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> Each jaw 13</span> carries a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> sharp edge 14</span> which is suitably shaped and sized for the clipping of nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As indicated, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> post 15</span> which is secured to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> lower bar 11</span> in rotatable manner and which passes through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> upper bar 11</span> as well as means for moving the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> jaws 11</span> relative to each other. This means is in the form of an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> actuating arm 16</span> which is pivotally mounted on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> post 15</span> via a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> bar 17</span> which is received in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> notch 17</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> post 15</span>. In this respect, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> actuating arm 16</span> can be moved from the position shown in FIGS. 1 and 3 into a position as shown in FIG. 5 for moving the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> bars 11</span> together in a conventional manner via a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cam 16</span>. As indicated, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> actuating arm 16</span> is bent to effect the pivoting action of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> bars 11</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to FIG. 1, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> one piece cover 18</span> is connected to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> and is disposed over one end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> to enclose the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> jaws 13</span> therein. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span> is made of any suitable material, for example, a plastic material.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span> includes a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> side walls 19</span> which are disposed in spaced apart relation, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> front wall 20</span> which connects the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> side walls 19</span> together, and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> rear wall 21</span> (see FIG. 2) which connects the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> side walls 19</span> together and which is disposed opposite the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> front wall 20</span> to define a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> hollow space 22</span> (see FIG. 2) therebetween for receiving the forward end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> (see FIG. 3).  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span> also has a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> shoulders 23</span>, each of which is disposed on an upper end of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> respective side wall 19</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> Each shoulder 23</span> projects into the space between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> side walls 19</span> in order to define a stop for abutting the forward end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> as indicated in FIG. 5.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to FIG. 2, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> front wall 20</span> carries a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> shoulder 24</span> which projects into the internal space of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span> towards the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> rear wall 21</span> in order to define a stop for abutting the forward end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> as indicated in FIG. 3  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to FIG. 3, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span> is assembled with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> so as to be permanently connected with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> while being disposed over the end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> to enclose the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> jaws 13</span> therein. As indicated, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span> is movably mounted on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> to move between a first position shielding the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> jaws 13</span> as indicated in FIG. 3 and a second position exposing the jaws as indicated in FIG. 5. To this end, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span> has an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> opening 25</span> above the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> front wall 20</span> for alignment with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> jaws 13</span> in the position shown in FIG. 5 in order to provide access to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> jaws 13</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span> also has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> second opening 26</span> in a bottom thereof through which nail clippings can be expelled from within the cover when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> clipper 10</span> is in use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As indicated in FIG. 3, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> rear wall 21</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span> is of less height than the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> front wall 20</span> for disposition between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> elongated bars 11</span> of the nail clipper. In addition, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> rear wall 21</span> is disposed on a side of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> post 15</span> which is remote from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> front wall 20</span>. As indicated in FIG. 5, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> rear wall 21</span> is sized and shaped so as not to interfere with the bringing together of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> cutting jaws 14</span> or m y be sufficiently soft and resilient to compress under the compressing force imposed by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> actuating arm 16</span> via the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> bars 11</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      By way of example, during assembly, prior to insertion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> post 15</span> into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> bars 11</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span> can be slid over the end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> bars 11</span> with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> rear wall 21</span> disposed between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> bars 11</span>. Thereafter, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> post 15</span> can be passed upwardly, as viewed in FIG. 3 through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> lower bar 11</span> past the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> rear wall 21</span> and through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> upper bar 11</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> actuating arm 16</span> can then be mounted on the upper end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> post 15</span> to secure the components together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As indicated in FIG. 4, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> shoulders 23</span> on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> side walls 19</span> of the cover are spaced apart a distance sufficient to permit passage of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> actuating arm 16</span> from the position shown in FIG. 3 to the position shown in FIG. 5.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In use, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span> is mounted on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> in a position to have the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> front wall 20</span> shield the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> jaws 13</span>, for example as shown in FIG. 3. In this position, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span> may be readily carried in a pocket, purse, on a key chain, and in other conventional manners. Further, this shielded position can be maintained by having the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> side walls 19</span> contact the sides of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> clipper bars 11</span> in a friction fit manner. That is, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> side walls 19</span> are spaced apart a distance equal to or slightly less than the width of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> clipper bars 11</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      When one desires to use the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span> is pivoted from the position shown in FIG. 3 to the position shown in FIG. 5 relative to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span>. In this position, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> jaws 13</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> are exposed through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> opening 25</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> jaws 13</span> may then be manipulated so as to cut a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> nail 27</span>, such as on a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> finger 28</span> of a person. In this respect, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> jaws 13</span> are slightly recessed within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span> so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> sharp cutting edges 14</span> do not project outwardly of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span>. The nail clippings which are subsequently made can then be passed through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> opening 26</span> in the bottom of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Alternatively, if one desires, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span> instead of being made skeletal as shown, may be provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> limited opening 26</span> in the bottom so that nail clippings may be accumulated within the interior space of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span>. In this respect, the opening would be sufficient so as to permit passage of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> post 15</span> through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> bars 11</span> during assembly. Still further, the opening may be plugged after assembling of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span> on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> so as to close off the bottom of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Various modifications may be made in the construction of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cover 18</span>, such as in the shape, thickness and spacings of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> variou<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">s walls<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> 19, 20, 21</span></span></span> to facilitate encapsulation of the cutting end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> and manipulation of the cover into the unshielded position to expose the cutting end for use. For example, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> rear wall 21</span> should be wide enough to seal off any chips from entering the rear and thin enough to compress as the nail clipper closes.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The invention thus provides a cover of relatively simple compact construction which can be readily mounted on the cutting end of the nail clipper. Further, the invention provides a cover which can be readily manipulated from a position shielding the cutting jaws of the nail clipper to a position to permit access to the cutting jaws of the nail clipper. </p>
