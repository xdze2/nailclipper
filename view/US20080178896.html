                        <p>      FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    This invention generally relates to containment and disposal of nail clippings, and, more particularly, to a sealable disposable containment device for catching and disposing of nail clippings so that the clipping can be carried out with a conventional nail clipper in a safe and sanitary fashion.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0003]    Nails require periodic maintenance including cleaning and cutting. Nails are cleaned and trimmed with instruments such as nail files, nail clippers and scissors. Nail clippings is an unavoidable by-product of the cutting process. Anyone who has trimmed nails in the past will know that nails have a unique propensity to fly away in numerous directions from the toe or finger undergoing the cutting because of the hard composition of the nail and the action of the cutting implement. For this reason, it is extremely difficult to cut nails without creating nail clippings in the surrounding areas.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    Nail clippings are problematic in that it is difficult to detect because of the small size of the nails. Concomitantly, locating and collecting cut nails is difficult, especially if the nails have fallen onto a floor. Furthermore, nail clippings is troublesome source of germs which collect at the tip and beneath nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    Accordingly, there is a need for a container for holding fingernail and toenail clippings, prevents scattering of nail clippings during the nail cutting process, is compatible with all finger and toe sizes, is compatible with all conventional nail clippers, may be easily sealed and discarded, and is inexpensive to manufacture. The invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems and solving one or more of the needs as set forth above.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0006]    To solve one or more of the problems set forth above, in an exemplary implementation of the invention, a sealable disposable containment device for catching and disposing of nail clippings so that the clipping can be carried out with a conventional nail clipper in a safe and sanitary fashion is provided. An exemplary sealable disposable containment device for catching and disposing of nail clippings includes an enclosure, a hand aperture formed in a first side of the enclosure, and a tool aperture formed in a second side of the enclosure opposite the first side. The hand aperture is adapted to receive a hand and includes an elastic wrist band adapted to securely fit around a wrist of a received hand. The tool aperture is adapted to receive a nail tool. The tool aperture may include a finished edge, such as a finished hemmed edge or a finished rimmed edge.  </p>

                        <p>        [0014]    Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the figures are not intended to be drawn to any particular scale; nor are the figures intended to illustrate every embodiment of the invention. The invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiments depicted in the figures or the types, shapes, relative sizes, ornamental aspects or proportions shown in the figures.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        DETAILED DESCRIPTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0015]    Referring to the Figures, in which like parts are indicated with the same reference numerals, various views of a sealable disposable containment device for catching and disposing of nail clippings according to principles of the invention are shown. Referring initially to  FIGS. 1 and 2 , top and bottom plan views of an exemplary sealable disposable containment device for catching and disposing of nail clippings according to principles of the invention are shown, designated generally as  100 . The device comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105">bag-like enclosure  105</span>  with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">hand aperture  115</span>  adapted to receive a hand and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">tool aperture  110</span>  adapted to receive a nail clipper. In a preferred embodiment, the hand aperture includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">elastic wrist band  120</span>  to ensure a secure fit around the wrist of a received hand. Also in a preferred embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">tool aperture  110</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem125">finished edge  125</span>  such as with a rim or hem, to provide structural reinforcement and resist tearing upon insertion of a clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0016]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105">exemplary bag-like enclosure  105</span>  is an envelope comprising substantially rectangular flat bottom panel attached along edges to a substantially rectangular flat top panel. The flat panels are preferably transparent, or substantially so, and relatively flexible. Transparency facilitates viewing the nail clipping operation. Flexibility facilitates manipulation of the clipper and hand. By way of example and not limitation, the envelope may be made of thin, flexible, plastic film of plastic or polymeric material such as polyethylene, polypropylene, coexstrusions of multiple layers to improve physical properties and optimize material usage, laminations for better mechanical or barrier properties as nylon and LDPE, woven plastic fibers such as oriented polypropylene, plasticized PVC, TyvekÂ® and/or cellophane.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0017]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">hand aperture  115</span>  is formed along one side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105">bag-like enclosure  105</span> . It is sized to receive an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem305">entire hand  305</span> , as shown in  FIGS. 3 and 4 . The device may also be adapted for pedicures, and sized to receive all or part of a foot. Advantageously, the hand (or foot) need not be withdrawn until the entire clipping operation is completed. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">elastic wrist band  120</span>  ensures a secure yet comfortable fit around the wrist (or foot or ankle) of a received hand (or foot). Concomitantly, the elastic wrist band prevents nail clippings from escaping through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">hand aperture  115</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0018]    At the side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105">exemplary bag-like enclosure  105</span>  opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">hand aperture  115</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">tool aperture  110</span>  opens into the enclosure to allow insertion of all or part of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">nail clipper  300</span> , as shown in  FIGS. 3 and 4 . Preferably, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">tool aperture  110</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem125">finished edge  125</span>  such as with a rim or hem, to provide structural reinforcement and resist tearing upon insertion of a clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]    The invention is not limited to use with any particular type of nail clipper. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">nail clipper  300</span>  constructed in conventional fashion with a pair of opposed trimming jaws and a fulcrum arm, may be used. A nail file or scissors may also be used. Any manicure and/or pedicure tool sized to be received through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">tool aperture  110</span>  may be utilized and suitable for use within the confinements of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105">enclosure  105</span>  may be used.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]    In use, preferably a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem305">hand  305</span>  or foot is inserted through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">hand aperture  115</span>  into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">sealable disposable containment device  100</span> . Then a manicure or pedicure tool such as a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">nail clipper  300</span>  is inserted through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">tool aperture  110</span>  into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">sealable disposable containment device  100</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem305">inserted hand  305</span>  may conveniently grip and manipulate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">inserted tool  300</span> . Then nails on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem305">inserted hand  305</span>  may then be trimmed within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">sealable disposable containment device  100</span> , which will catch all of the nail clippings. After trimming of the nails is completed, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem305">hand  305</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">tool  300</span>  may be removed. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">sealable disposable containment device  100</span>  can then be easily sealed and carried to a place where the nail clippings can be disposed of.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]    Sealing is accomplished by rolling or folding the sealable disposable containment device so that the ends are not exposed or are not substantially exposed.
