                        <p>        [0002]    The present invention relates to a nail clipper, and more particularly, to a method for manufacturing an inclined curve-type blade body, a blade body made therefrom, and a nail clipper having the blade body thereof which has a 3-dimensional structure complying with the curvature of a user&#39;s nail and is also capable of mass production of the same having the inclined curve-type blades exactly engaged with each other regardless of a grinding deviation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND ART  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0003]    In general, a conventional nail clipper is provided with upper and lower blades constituting a blade body, which are in the form of inclined surfaces with symmetric structures. The upper and lower inclined surfaces are formed in slightly concave surfaces having the same curvatures. The upper and lower blades having the constructions as such can be manufactured by simultaneously grinding the ends of the blade bodies using grinding media which have a radius corresponding to the curvature of the ends of the blade bodies being horizontally engaged with each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]      FIGS. 1 to 5  are schematic views each illustrating the classification of the engagement pattern of the upper and lower blades for various nail clippers.  FIG. 1  shows constructions of a conventional nail clipper, wherein the blades of the upper and lower blade bodies are engaged with each other with a curve (A-B-C) in the X-Y plane. In the drawings, points A and C indicate the opposite ends of a blade, respectively and the point C is the center of the blade.  FIG. 2  shows constructions of another conventional nail clipper, wherein the blades of the upper and lower blade bodies are engaged with each other with a straight line (A-B-C) in the X axis.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    Referring to  FIG. 1 , the upper and lower blades in the prior art are formed in concave curved surfaces when seen from the plan view as shown in  FIG. 1(   d ), so a user&#39;s nail can be cut in a circular pattern. However, when seen from the front view as shown in  FIG. 1(   b ), the upper and lower blades are engaged together in a straight line. Therefore, since the user has to cut his/her nail with a circular curved-surface shape using the upper and lower blades to be engaged with in a straight line, some problems are raised therefrom.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    In other words, when the user uses a conventional nail clipper having horizontal upper and lower blades as shown in  FIG. 1 , the end portion of the nail should be inserted between the upper and lower blades to be pressed together. Then, a downward force is applied to the middle convex portion of the nail, while a lifting force is exerted on the opposite edge portions of the nail. At this moment, the forces exerted in the opposite directions, i.e., shearing forces are applied to the nail itself, and the cutting operation of the nail is then performed while the nail is flatly retained between the upper and lower blades. Consequently, whenever the nail clipping operation is performed, stress and strain are repetitiously applied to the nail. Even in a severe case, the conventional nail clipper as described above has drawbacks in that a frail or weak nail may be damaged, or eventually torn or broken.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    In order to resolve or lessen the drawbacks in the conventional nail clippers, a variety of technologies have been proposed. For instance, there is a Korean Patent No. 10-0674475 (Jan. 19, 2007) entitled “a method for manufacturing an arc-type blade body, the blade body made therefrom, and a nail clipper having the blade body” which was issued to the same applicant of the present invention. This patent relates to a manufacturing method for a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">two (2</span>)-dimensional vertical and curve-type blade which is referenced to the present invention, wherein the upper and lower blade bodies are engaged with each other with a vertical curve (A-B-C) in the X-Z plane. The upper and lower blades of the blade body engaged with each other are in the form of an upward curve-shape, when seen from the front view. Since these blades are designed to comply with the cross-sectional shape of the nail having a curved surface, thereby considerably reducing the stress and the strain applied to the nail during the clipping operation. The blade body with the constructions as the above may be a useful technology for the users who want to cut their nails in a straight line following the art of nail fashion like a nail art. However, since the end of the nail is cut in the straight line, it cannot be employed to the case where the user wants to cut the nail in a curve-shape.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    In order to solve the problems as described above, as shown in  FIGS. 4 and 5 , a curve-type blade with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">three (3</span>)-dimensional structure may be proposed, wherein the upper and lower blades are engaged with each other in the shape of an upward curve-shape, and at the same time slightly inclined rearward in a direction of the handle, i.e., in a longitudinal direction of the blade body. However, such a proposal is just an idea, which has been regarded as technically impossible up to now to manufacture the curve-type blade having such a geometrical structure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    Meanwhile, a variety of technologies relating to the blade body of the nail clipper have been proposed as following: For example, Korean Patent Laid Open No. 10-2004-0043581 (May 24, 2004), Japanese Utility Model Laid Open Sho49-120419 (Oct. 16, 1974), Japanese Utility Model Laid Open Sho51-119970 (Sep. 12, 1977), Japanese Utility Model Laid Open Sho54-98369 (Jul. 11, 1979), Japanese Utility Model Laid Open Sho54-116468 (Aug. 15, 1979), Japanese Utility Model Laid Open No. 2005-74135 (Mar. 24, 2005), Japanese Utility Model Laid Open Pyoung01-145305 (Oct. 5, 1989), and U.S. Design Pat. No. 371, 636 (Jul. 9, 1996), or the like.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    In particular, U.S. Design Pat. No. 371, 636 discloses that the end portions of the upper and lower blades of the nail clipper have inclined curve-type surfaces. However, this patent just discloses such a design for an exterior shape of the nail clipper, but is silent on the technical method how to manufacture such inclined curve-type blades.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    Some prior arts in the above list roughly mention about the shape of the nail clipper having an inclined curve-type blade or its usefulness. However, they only raise problems to be solved or suggest idea on the shape of the inclined curve-type blade, but they fail to propose the manufacturing technologies or theoretical backgrounds how to construct and produce the inclined curve-type blade as such.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    Generally, the blade grinding work in the manufacturing process of the nail clipper is performed in a short period of time about 1-2 seconds by bringing the blades into contact with the grinding media. At this point, the upper and lower blades should be manufactured to be exactly engaged with each other. However, during a manual or an automatic grinding work, a deviation in the respective grinding depths of the blade is inevitably generated due to the jig of a grinding machine, grinding work conditions, degrees of the worker&#39;s skillfulness or the like.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]    In other words, the grinding work of the blades of the nail clipper may be divided into a manual, a semi-automatic or fully automatic work. Generally, a grinding roller with a radius suitable for the curvature of the curved surface of the end portion of the blade is used in the grinding work. The manual grinding work has a considerable difference in its grinding result depending upon the skillfulness of the worker. Further, in the semi-automatic or fully automatic grinding work there also generates deviations due to the jig or the transporting mechanism or a variety of deviations according to the degree of wear of the grinding media. Because of these deviations, the middle portion of the upper and lower blades is likely to be opened or the gap between the opposite edges of the upper and lower blades are widened after the grinding work, which makes it difficult to obtain a nail clipper having a desired quality.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0014]    Meanwhile, a nail clipper of which upper and lower blades are exactly engaged with each other may be manufactured by elaborate manual grinding works. However, in order to mass-produce the nail clipper having a uniform, precise and high quality, a theoretical background and manufacturing technology for production of the nail clipper must be provided to support that. In other words, it is necessary to propose a method for forming an inclined curve-type blade body whose upper and lower blades are exactly engaged with each other regardless of the grinding work condition, so as to mass-produce the blade body with the same quality of which upper and lower blades are precisely engaged with each other without any gap therebetween. At this point, it is very important to provide conditions for the mass production of the blade body having the same quality despite the existence of the considerable deviations in the grinding depth.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0015]    However, in the technical fields relating to the nail clipper, there has been yet no technical solution or proposal about how to manufacture the inclined curve-type blade body, whose upper and lower blades are exactly engaged with each other in the 3-dimensional space. Moreover, they are silent on which conditions are required to mass produce the nail clipper having the inclined curve-type blade body with the same quality regardless of the existence of the considerable grinding deviations. This appears to be certain that the technology or method to produce the inclined curve-type blade having such a 3-dimensional structure has not been found up to now. Such assumption as the above can be supported by the fact that there have been no nail clippers having such an inclined curve-type blade among the commercially developed and marketed nail clippers to this date.  </p>

                        <p>          [0018]    Further, it is still another object of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing an inclined curve-type blade body of a nail clipper whose upper and lower blades are exactly engaged with each other regardless of grinding deviations in the grinding process, and which can be mass-produced with the same quality.  </p>

The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">upper inclined curve-type blade  53</span>  in accordance with the present invention described hereinbelow is provided on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">upper inclined surface  51</span> . Meanwhile, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">upward inclined surface  52</span>  facing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">upper inclined surface  51</span>  is correspondingly formed at the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower blade body  12</span>  (referred to as <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">“lower inclined surface  52</span> ” hereinafter). The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">lower inclined curve-type blade  54</span>  in accordance with the present invention described hereinafter, corresponding to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">upper inclined curve-type blade  53</span> , is provided on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lower inclined surface  52</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0056]    As shown in  FIGS. 11 and 12  in detail, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade body  10</span>  is prepared to be formed with the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">lower blade bodies  11</span>  and  12  at the opposite ends of a longitudinally extending metal sheet, respectively. The metal sheet is then bent at an imaginary center line in the longitudinal direction thereof so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">upper inclined surface  51</span>  exactly faces the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lower inclined surface  52</span> . When the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">lower blade bodies  11</span>  and  12  are pressed using a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130">lever  130</span> , the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">lower blade bodies  11</span>  and  12  are engaged with or separated from each other to perform the nail clipping operation with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">inclined curve-type blades  53</span>  and  54 . At this moment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade body  10</span>  is freely rotatable at 360 degrees about the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">supporting shaft  110</span>  with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">nail clipper body  120</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0057]      FIG. 8  is a perspective view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">nail clipper  200</span>  in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">nail clipper  200</span>  is made by applying the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">inclined curve-type blades  53</span>  and  54  in accordance with the present invention to the conventional nail clipper. In other words, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">blade body  20</span>  is composed of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">upper blade body  21</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lower blade body  22</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">inclined curve-type blades  53</span>  and  54  in accordance with the present invention are formed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">inclined surfaces  51</span>  and  52  at the end portions of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower blade bodies  21</span>  and  22 , respectively. The rear ends of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower blade bodies  21</span>  and  22  are secured to each other with a conventional joining means, such as a spot welding, a riveting, a clinching, an eyeleting, a brazing, a dovetailing, a bending work or the like, so the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">lower blade bodies  21</span>  and  22  are integrally joined with each other. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem230">lever  230</span>  is coupled with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">blade body  20</span>  through a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">supporting shaft  210</span>  which is penetrated into a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">supporting shaft hole  23</span> , so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem230">lever  230</span>  presses down the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">inclined curve-type blades  53</span>  and  54  to cut the user&#39;s nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0058]      FIG. 9  is a perspective view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">nail clipper  300</span>  in accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention, in which favorable modifications are made to the nail clipper shown in  FIG. 8 . That is, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">nail clipper  300</span>  is characterized in that spoon-shaped nail collecting parts are correspondingly provided at the respective end portions of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">lower blade bodies  31</span>  and  32  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">blade body  30</span>  having the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">inclined curve-type blades  53</span>  and  54 . Hence, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem300">nail clipper  300</span>  as constructed above is able to effectively prevent the nail being cut from scattering towards the surroundings, thereby providing a hygienic environment. Similar to the nail clipper shown in  FIG. 8 , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem330">lever  330</span>  is coupled with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">blade body  30</span>  through a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem310">supporting shaft  310</span>  which is penetrated into a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">supporting shaft hole  33</span> , which allows the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem330">lever  330</span>  to press down the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">inclined curve-type blades  53</span>  and  54  to cut the user&#39;s nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0059]      FIG. 10  is a perspective view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">nail clipper  400</span>  in accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention, which is a slim-type nail clipper called a flat-type nail clipper. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail clipper blade body  40</span>  is divided into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">upper blade body  41</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">lower blade body  42</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">inclined surfaces  51</span>  and  52  of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">lower blade bodies  41</span>  and  42  are formed with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">inclined curve-type blade  53</span>  and  54  in accordance with the present invention as described above, respectively. The upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">lower blade bodies  41</span>  and  42  are pivotably coupled with each other about a pivot axis, i.e., a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem410">pin  410</span>  at a location adjacent to the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">lower inclined surfaces  51</span>  and  52 . Hence, without a separate lever as shown in  FIGS. 8 and 9 , the distal end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">lower blade body  42</span>  serves as a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem430">lever  430</span>  and is pivoted about the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem410">pin  410</span>  to press the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">inclined curve-type blades  53</span>  and  54  for cutting the user&#39;s nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0060]      FIG. 11  is a perspective view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade body  10</span>  shown in  FIG. 7 , which is separated from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">main body  120</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">nail clipper  100</span> .  FIG. 11  clearly shows the construction of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade body  10</span>  which is bent at the imaginary center line in its longitudinal direction to form the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">lower blade bodies  11</span>  and  12 , facing each other on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">inclined surfaces  51</span>  and  52 , having th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">e respective inclined curve-type blades  53</span>  and  54  in accordance with the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0061]      FIG. 12  is a schematic view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade body  10</span>  of  FIG. 11 , wherein  FIG. 12(   a ) is a front view,  FIG. 12(   b ) is a plan view,  FIG. 12(   c ) is a side elevational view seen from the right side, and  FIG. 12(   d ) is a bottom view. As shown in  FIG. 12 , it can be appreciated that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">inclined curve-type blades  53</span>  and  54  of the present invention provide a blade engagement in the shape of a upward curve-type as seen from the front view, while the blades are in the form of concave blades as seen from both the plan view and the bottom view.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0062]    Meanwhile, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">inclined curve-type blades  53</span>  and  54  of the present invention as shown in  FIGS. 7 to 12  have been made by the same technical principle. Such a technical principle to form and manufacture the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">inclined surfaces  51</span>  and  52  as well as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">inclined curve-type blades  53</span>  and  54  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade body  10</span> ,  20 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> 30  or  40</span>  of the nail clipper will be described in detail with reference to  FIGS. 13 to 15  hereinbelow.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0063]      FIG. 13  illustrates the positional relationship between the nail clipper blade body and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">cylindrical grinding media  60</span>  to be used for grinding works. The center of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">grinding media  60</span>  is located in the Z axis, and the center line of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper blade body  11</span> ,  21 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> 31  or  41</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower blade body  12</span> ,  22 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> 32  or  42</span>  lower bodies is located in the Y axis to be merged with the Z axis. When the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">inclined surface  51</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper blade body  11</span> ,  21 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> 31  or  41</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">inclined surface  52</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower blade body  12</span> ,  22 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> 32  or  42</span>  are merged into the outer periphery of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">grinding media  60</span>  with a radius Rg maintaining a perpendicular angle therebetween, it can be noted that an inclined curve with a predetermined curvature Ra is formed at their contacting portions.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0064]    Referring to  FIG. 14 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper blade body  11</span> ,  21 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> 31  or  41</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower blade body  12</span> ,  22 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> 32  or  42</span>  are shown as separated from each other for simplicity. It can be appreciated that the inclined curve with the curvature Ra, which is formed when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">inclined surface  51</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper blade body  11</span> ,  21 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> 31  or  41</span>  merges into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">grinding media  60</span> , is consecutively extending downward at the same angle corresponding to the inclination angle of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">inclined surface  51</span>  to form a trajectory and makes a surface using such a trajectory to finally form the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lower inclined surface  52</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower blade body  12</span> ,  22 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> 32  or  42</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0065]    In other words, as shown in  FIG. 14 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">inclined surfaces  51</span>  and  52  having the same i<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nclination angles θ 1</span>  and θ 2  with respect to an imaginary vertical line are formed at the end portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper blade body  11</span> ,  21 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> 31  or  41</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower blade body  12</span> ,  22 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> 32  or  42</span>  of the nail clipper blade body. Here, the inner side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">upper inclined surface  51</span>  provided at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper blade body  11</span> ,  21 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> 31  or  41</span>  is a concave curved surface (refer to  FIGS. 6(   b ) and ( d )) having a flat surface or a predetermined curvature Rb (reference numeral  70  in  FIG. 15) , which is formed along the entire length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">upper inclined surfaces  51</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">cylindrical grinding media  60</span>  with the radius Rg is then brought into contact with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">inclined surface  51</span>  as such. When the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">inclined surface  51</span>  is merged with the outer periphery of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">grinding media  60</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">grinding media  60</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">inclined surface  51</span>  form the inclined curve with a predetermined curvature Ra at the boundary line therebetween. Then, this means that the upper and lower blade bodies are obtained by making the respective inside surfaces form the upper and lower inclined surfaces according to the aforementioned ways. Therefore, when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">upper inclined surface  51</span>  is put into the grinding operation using the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">cylindrical grinding media  60</span>  with the radius Rg, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">upper inclined curve-type blade  53</span>  is then formed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">inclined surface  51</span>  accordingly (refer to  FIGS. 6(   b ) and ( d )).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0066]    Meanwhile, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">upper inclined curve-type blade  53</span>  formed at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper blade body  11</span> ,  21 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> 31  or  41</span>  is itself consecutively extending downward at the a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ngle θ 2</span>  corresponding to the a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">ngle θ 1</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">upper inclined surface  51</span>  to form a trajectory and makes a closed curved surface using such trajectory on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lower inclined surface  52</span> . Then, the closed curved surface will become the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">inclined curve-type blade  54</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower blade body  12</span> ,  22 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> 32  or  42</span> , corresponding to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">upper inclined curve-type blade  53</span>  and also being exactly engaged therewith. In other words, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">cylindrical grinding media  60</span>  with the radius Rg is placed in the upright position, and then the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lower inclined surface  52</span>  is brought into contact with the outer periphery of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">grinding media  60</span> . Then, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lower inclined surface  52</span>  makes contact with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">grinding media  60</span> , while forming an inclined curve with the predetermined curvature Ra therebetween. Accordingly, with the geometrical relationship as the above, when the end portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lower inclined surface  52</span>  is ground using the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">cylindrical grinding media  60</span>  with the radius Rg, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">lower inclined curve-type blade  54</span>  is finally formed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lower inclined surface  52</span> , corresponding to the inclined curve having the curvature Ra.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0067]    Hence, when the end portions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper blade body  11</span> ,  21 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> 31  or  41</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower blade body  12</span> ,  22 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> 32  or  42</span>  are simultaneously ground using the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">cylindrical grinding media  60</span>  with the radius Rg, a rea<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">rward inclined concave curve-type blade  53</span>  (refer to  FIGS. 6(   b ) and ( d )) is formed on the inside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper blade body  11</span> ,  21 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> 31  or  41</span>  along its longitudinal direction. Similarly, a re<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">arward inclined convex curve-type blade  54</span>  (refer to  FIGS. 6(   c ) and ( e )) is formed on the inside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower blade body  12</span> ,  22 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> 32  or  42</span>  along its longitudinal direction. That is, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">inclined curve-type blades  53</span>  and  54  which are completely corresponding to each other in their geometric conformities can be simultaneously manufactured by the grinding work as the above.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0068]    At this point, it should be noted that even though there is a deviation in the relative position of the end portions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper blade body  11</span> ,  21 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> 31  or  41</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower blade body  12</span> ,  22 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> 32  or  42</span>  with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">grinding media  60</span> , i.e., a deviation in the penetrating depth into the latter in the grinding work, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">inclined curve-type blades  53</span>  and  54  having the same shapes are obtained by the grinding work. This is the unique feature of the present invention to provide the upper and lower blades having 3-dimensional structures, wherein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">inc<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">lined curve-type blades  53</span>  or  54</span>  with the same curvature Ra and without any changes in their geometries can be formed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">respective inclined surfaces  51</span>  and  52 . It can be appreciated that such a feature has been the technical basis for mass-producing the nail clipper having the inventive upper and lower blade bodies because the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">inc<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">lined curve-type blades  53</span>  or  54</span>  having the same geometric constructions can be manufactured regardless of the deviation in the grinding depth due to skillfulness of the worker, jigs used in the grinding work or the like.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0069]      FIG. 15  is a schematic view for analyzing the geometric construction of the inclined curve-type blade body in accordance with the present invention.  FIG. 15(   a ) is a side elevational view showing the end portions of the upper and lower blade bodies,  FIG. 15(   b ) is a front view from the outside showing the engaged upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">lower blades  53</span>  and  54  having the curvature Rn,  FIG. 15(   c ) is a plan view,  FIG. 15(   d ) is a bottom view, and  FIG. 15(   e ) is a view showing the curvature Rb of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">upper inclined surface  51</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0070]    Referring to  FIG. 15(   c ), the curvature Rb of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">upper inclined curve-type blade  53</span>  in the plan view is obtained in response to the radius Rg of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">grinding media  60</span>  to be used in the grinding work. The i<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nclination angles θ 1</span>  and θ 2  (θ 1 =θ 2 ) are determined depending upon the sharpness degree of the upper and lower blade bodies, conditions of the manufacturing process or the like, as shown in  FIG. 15(   a ). Next, as shown in  FIG. 15(   b ), the curvature Rn of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">lower inclined curve-type blades  53</span>  and  54  being engaged with each other in the front view is correspondingly determined in response to the curvature of the user&#39;s nail to be cut. With the curvature Rn and the radius Rg a closed curve indicated by a-b-c-d is obtained as shown in  FIG. 15(   a ). Therefore, as shown in  FIG. 15(   e ), a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">curved surface  70</span>  with the curvature Rb corresponding to the closed curve is formed and used to constitute the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">upper inclined surface  51</span>  of the upper blade body. In other words, an upper inclined curve indicated by a-b is obtained as shown in  FIG. 15  ( a ). Accordingly, when the upper inclined curve is consecutively extended downward at the a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ngle θ 2</span>  corresponding to the a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">ngle θ 1</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">upper inclined surface  51</span>  to form a trajectory, a closed curved surface conforming such trajectory constitutes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lower inclined surface  52</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0071]    The descriptions as the above may be further explained by using geometry to determine the inclined curve as follows. First, referring to  FIG. 15(   b ), the inclined curve can be obtained from the curvature Rn seen from the front view of the nail clipper. That is, in  FIG. 15(   a ), the i<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nclination angle θ 1</span>  in the upper blade body is determined. When the width W of the blade and the radius Rg of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">grinding media  60</span>  are given, the curvature Rb of the closed curve indicated by a-b-c-d in  FIG. 15  ( a ) constituting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">upper inclined surface  51</span> , i.e., the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">upper inclined curved surface  70</span>  in  FIG. 15(   e ) is obtained. Hence, the upper inclined curve indicated by a-b is formed as shown in  FIG. 15  ( a ). Thereafter, when the upper inclined curve a-b is consecutively extended downward at the a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ngle θ 2</span>  corresponding to the a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">ngle θ 1</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">upper inclined surface  51</span>  to form a trajectory, a closed curved surface indicated by a-b-c-d conforming such trajectory may constitute the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lower inclined surface  52</span> . That is, the closed curved surface indicated by a-b-c-d constitutes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">inclined surface  52</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">inclined curve-type blade  54</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower blade body  12</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0072]    In contrast, as another embodiment of the present invention, the inclined curve can be obtained after the curvature Rb of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">upper inclined surface  51</span>  is determined. That is, when the i<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nclination angle θ 1</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">upper inclined surface  51</span> , the width W of the blade and the radius Rg of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">grinding media  60</span>  are given, the upper inclined curve indicated by a-b and its curvature Rn seen from the front view is obtained. Next, when the upper inclined curve a-b is consecutively extended downward at the a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ngle θ 2</span>  corresponding to the a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">ngle θ 1</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">upper inclined surface  51</span>  to form a trajectory, a closed curved surface indicated by a-b-e-f conforming such trajectory may constitute the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lower inclined surface  52</span> . That is, the closed curved surface indicated by a-b-c-d constitutes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lower inclined surface  52</span>  to form the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">inclined curve-type blade  54</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower blade body  12</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0073]    At this point, the inclined curve indicated by a-b has to be regarded as a unitary element, and its length, height, curvature, angle or the like should not be changed or modified. In other words, it is the core technology of the present invention that the inclined curve a-b of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper blade body  12</span>  is consecutively extended downward at the a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">ngle θ 2</span>  corresponding to the a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">ngle θ 1</span> (here, θ 1 =θ 2 ) to form a trajectory onto the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower blade body  12</span> , thereby constituting the inclined curved surface indicated by a-b-e-f on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower blade body  12</span>  by using the trajectory as the above. Consequently, this can be interpreted as that even if the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">lower inclined surfaces  51</span>  and  52  are slightly displaced in a horizontal direction and ground by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">grinding media  60</span>  which is rotating in the upright position, the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">lower inclined curve-type blades  53</span>  and  54  having the same shapes and curvatures can be obtained through the grinding work.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0074]      FIG. 16  is a schematic view illustrating the difference from  FIG. 15 , supposing that the blade body of the  FIG. 15  has been penetrated into and ground by 0.3 mm deeper than that of  FIG. 15 .  FIG. 16(   a ) is a side elevational view showing the end portions of the upper and lower blade bodies,  FIG. 16(   b ) is a front view showing the inclined upper and lower blades engaged therewith from the outside,  FIG. 16(   c ) is a plan view, and  FIG. 16(   d ) is a bottom view.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0075]    Referring to  FIG. 16(   c ), when the blade body of the  FIG. 15  has been penetrated towards the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">grinding media  60</span>  and ground by 0.3 mm deeper than the reference value of  FIG. 15 , the two closed curves constituting the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">lower inclined surfaces  51</span>  and  52  are separated from each other as shown in  FIG. 16(   a ), leaving the closed curves indicated by a 1-b1-c-d and a2-b2-e-f, respectively. In other words, it can be noted that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">upper curve-type blade  53</span>  indicated by a1-b1 appears to be separated from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">lower curve-type blade  54</span>  indicated by a2-b2.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0076]    Detailed descriptions thereof will be explained hereinbelow. As shown in the front view of  FIG. 16(   b ), the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">lower inclined surfaces  51</span>  and  52  having the same geometric constructions are horizontally moved by 0.3 mm towards the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">cylindrical grinding media  60</span>  having the same radius Rg. Then, the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">lower curve-type blades  53</span>  and  54 , which are composed of the same curved surfaces as the inclined curved surface indicated by a-b in  FIG. 16(   a ), are slightly shifted upward to be ground accordingly. Despite such a shift, the geometric constructions of the upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">lower curve-type blades  53</span>  and  54  obtained by the grinding work are totally corresponding to each other, which makes it possible to be exactly engaged with each other. This geometric analysis as the above has been proved to lead the same conclusion by a simulation work using 3-dimensional modeling method.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0077]    Consequently, it can be appreciated that even though there is a deviation in the grinding depth of the upper and lower blade bodies with respect to the grinding media, the upper and lower inclined curve-type blades which are exactly corresponding to be engaged with each other can be obtained by the grinding work regardless of such a deviation. It should be appreciated that this means that the nail clipper having the inventive upper and lower inclined curve-type blades can be manufactured on commercial basis regardless of the deviation in the grinding depth due to skillfulness of the worker, jigs used in the grinding work or the like.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0078]    While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </p>
