                        <p>  Application June 19, 1958, Serial No. 743,222   </p>
                    
                        <p>  6 Claims. (Cl. 132-755) This invention relates to the art of manicure implements and particularly concerns an improved device for cleaning, cutting and filing nails and cuticle so that substantially an entire manicure treatment can beperformed with one self-contained tool. 7   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Heretofore it has required an array of scissors, clippers, files and similar tools to perform a satisfactory and complete manicure. The present invention has as its principal object to provide in a single tool a variety of blades, files, picks, and clippers so that a manicure can be performed more quickly and efficiently.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   edge 38 and blade 36 has alonger inwardly <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">curved cutti</span>ng i<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">ce - v-id</span>ed in leaves 12, 14 for hanging the tool on a suitab<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">le A fu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">rther o</span></span>bject is to provide a manicure implement with a pair of files operable by a lever for filing nails evenly and uniformly.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   For further comprehension of the invention, and of the objects and advantages thereof, reference will be had to the following description and accompanying drawings, and to the appended claims in which the various novel features of the invention are more particularly set forth.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the accompanying drawings forming a material part of this disclosure:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a manicure implement embodying the invention. j   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 2 is a longitudinal sectional view of ment showing filing a fingernail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 3 is a sectional view similar to Fig. 2 showing the implement in another filing position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 4 is a plan view of the implement in a closed position. v   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Fig. 5 is a side elevational view of the implement in a closed position. i I   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring to the drawings, there are shown two leaves 12 and 14 formed of spring st<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">eel. Th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">e leaves are elongat</span></span>ed in form and are secured together at one end by spot welds 15. The other ends of the leaves ar<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">e bent and bia</span>sed apart. They are brought toward each other against spring tension in the leaves themselves. A post 16 is secured near the free end of leaf 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">2. This </span>post extends perpendicularly the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">reto thr</span>ough an aperture 18 near the free end of leaf 14.

                        <p>   Mounted by Welding on the free end 32 of leaf 14 and angularly disposed <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">thereto is a</span> fi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">le eleme</span>nt 50. This element has a coarse rib<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">bed surface 52 f</span>acing outwardly. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> outermost end of the ele</span>ment is a sharp double bladed tip 54 which serves as a p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">ick or point for cleaning t</span>he ends of fingernails and for loosening cuticle. Thus, in Figs. 2 and 3 are shown a nail N with cuticle C and-a tip end B which would be cleaned and treated by bladed tip 54. Another file element 56 is moun<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">ted on the fre</span>e end 42 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">of leaf 12. This</span> element has a dou<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">ble blade po</span>int<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ed tip 5</span>8 and a coarse ribbe<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">d surface 60.

The file element<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">s are a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">rranged </span></span>to ahrade the end-E of a fingernail uniformly on opposite marginal portions as clearly shown in Figs. 2 and 3, when the lever 24 is operated toward and away from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">leaves 12</span> and14. Edges 38 and 40 are coplanar <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">and edges </span>45 and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">47 are <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">also copl</span></span>anar, so that whe<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">n the l<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">ever 24 i</span></span>s pivoted to its innermost position <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">as shown </span>in Figs. 2 and 3, the edges meet in fine lines which lie on the same plane. The edges of the blades all terminate beyond the innermost edges of the file elements 50 and 56- as shown in Fig. 2 so<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> that the blades </span>serve as stop elements to limit inward movement of the file elements. I   </p>
                    
                        <p>   There has thus been provided in the single manicure implement, blades 36 and 46 for cutting the fingernail. B<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">lades 3<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">4 and 44 t</span></span>rim the cuticle and corner p<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">ortions<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> of the na</span></span>il. Tips 54 and 58 loosen the cuticle and clean th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">e end o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">f the na</span></span>il. File elements 50 and 56 file the end of the na<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">il to a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> desired roundnes</span></span>s. The single lever 24 operates the blades and file e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">lements. If desi</span>red, the file elements and tips 54 and 58 can be used with the device in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">the clo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">sed posi</span></span>tion shown in Figs. 4 and 5. By contacting the end of the fingernail with the two angularly disposed file elements and sliding the file elements over the nail end, a very fine finish can be obtained. In the action of Figs. 2 and 3, the file elements move in opposite directions while the lever is operated. In the closed position of the device both file elements move in the same direction together.   </p>
