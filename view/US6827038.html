                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> An article for grooming an animal comprises a nail clipper and a source of styptic material that is mounted to the nail clipper. In the preferred embodiment, the styptic material is provided within a cartridge that is mounted to a handle of the nail clipper. A nail file is preferably provided on an outside casing of the cartridge. The cartridge further includes a bowl shaped application area that may be used to conveniently apply the styptic to the animal during or after clipping. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This invention relates generally to the field of pet care and grooming. More specifically, this invention relates to an improved nail clipper assembly for cutting the nails of pets that are not being naturally worn down by the pet&#39;s daily activity.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Description of the Related Technology  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Pets such as dogs, cats and birds have nails that will continue to grow naturally even when the daily activity of the pet is not sufficient to wear the nails down to an appropriate length. Overgrown nails make walking uncomfortable and lead to soreness and other leg problems for the pet. For this reason, a properly groomed pet will have its nails inspected and trimmed to protect the elderly and young children from scratches as well as prevent damage to floors and furniture. Nail trimming is a recommended monthly procedure for house pets that do not wear down their nails naturally on outdoor concrete and asphalt surfaces. To correctly accomplish the task of trimming the pet&#39;s nails, the nail must be cut and then filed to remove burrs and sharp edges. A number of pet nail clippers are commercially available for use in the clipping process.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      When trimming a pet&#39;s nails, there is a significant risk of overtrimming, in which case a vein may be severed, causing the animal to bleed. This is commonly known as “quicking” the animal. Quicking is especially prevalent with dark-colored nails in which the vein is difficult to visually distinguish. When quicking occurs, it is desirable to apply styptic material to stop the bleeding. Styptic material is sold separately for this purpose in pet supply stores.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Animal grooming is a time-consuming task, especially for animal owners who have otherwise busy lives. It is time-consuming to separately purchase, store and organize the large number of articles and materials that are necessary to properly groom an animal such as a cat or a dog. A need exists for any system, article or process that will lighten the burden for pet owners in this regard.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved article for grooming pets that will reduce the large number of articles and materials that will need to be purchased and maintained in order to properly care for an animal.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In order to achieve the above and other objects of the invention, an article for grooming an animal according to a first aspect of the invention includes a nail clipper and a source of a styptic material that is being physically associated with the nail clipper.  </p>

                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding structure throughout the views, and referring in particular to FIG. 1, an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">article  10</span>  for grooming an animal according to a first, preferred embodiment of the invention is depicted in FIG.  1 . As may be seen in FIG. 1, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">article  10</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">nail clipper  12</span>  having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">source  14</span>  of styptic material mounted thereto. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">Nail clipper  12</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">first handle  16</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second handle  18</span>  that are movable with respect to each other in a first plane of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">motion  19</span>  in order to provide relative movement between a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">first cutting blade  22</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">stationary anvil  24</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">Cutting blade  22</span>  moves with respect to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">anvil  24</span>  in a second plane of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">motion  21</span>  that in this embodiment of the invention is substantially perpendicular to the first plane of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">motion  19</span> . As may be seen in FIG. 2, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">biasing spring  26</span>  is provided to relatively bias the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">second handles  16</span> ,  18  to an open position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      According to one important aspect of the invention, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">finger guard  20</span>  is provided so as to be integral to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second handle  18</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">Finger guard  20</span>  is radiused so as to define a finger opening in which a user&#39;s finger will be positioned during use of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">nail clipper  12</span> . The presence of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">finger guard  20</span>  both properly positions the user&#39;s finger as well as permitting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">nail clipper  12</span>  to be held by just one finger while it is being carried.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring briefly to FIG. 2, it will be seen that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">source  14</span>  of styptic material is preferably embodied as a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">removable cartridge  28</span>  that is secured within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">first handle  16</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">Removable cartridge  28</span>  is depicted in detail in FIGS. 3-5. It preferably includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">outer wall  29</span>  that defines an interior space in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">which styptic material  36</span>  is provided and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">thumbwheel  30</span>  that is connected to an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">internal threaded rod  32</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">Threaded rod  32</span>  is engaged with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">push plate  34</span>  that engages the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">styptic material  36</span>  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">thumbwheel  30</span>  and hence the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">threaded rod  32</span>  are rotated, thus expressing a controlled amount of styptic material from an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">opening  35</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cartridge  28</span>  that is positioned in an end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cartridge  28</span>  that is opposite from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">thumbwheel  30</span> . The styptic material is preferably provided within a matrix of wax-like material. Alternatively, it could be provided in another form, such as in powdered form.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      According to another important aspect of the invention, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cartridge  28</span>  further includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">application surface  38</span>  that is positioned at the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cartridge  28</span>  adjacent to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">opening  35</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">Application surface  38</span>  is ideally shaped to apply or pack in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">styptic material  36</span>  to the hollowed opening of the cut nail of a pet who is being groomed. As may be seen in FIG. 4, the application surface is preferably concave and is preferably positioned at an angle Θ with respect to a longitudinal axis of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cartridge  28</span> . Angle Θ is preferably within a range of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45"> plus 45</span> degrees to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45"> minus 45</span> degrees. Alternatively, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">application surface  38</span>  could be shaped so as to be a flat surface, a flat surface that is provided with containing structure to prevent the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">styptic material  36</span>  from falling to the ground, or alternative, equivalent structure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Advantageously, as shown in FIG. 5, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cartridge  28</span>  further has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail file  40</span>  provided on one surface thereon. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">Nail file  40</span>  may be used to smooth the severed nail of a pet after clipping. In the preferred embodiment, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail file  40</span>  includes a roughened surface such as an emery board that is attached to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cartridge  28</span> . Alternatively, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail file  40</span>  may be provided by molding a roughened surface directly into the side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cartridge  28</span> , or with a nail file element that is detachable from or otherwise mounted to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cartridge  28</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">clipper assembly  50</span>  according to a second embodiment of the invention is depicted in FIG.  6 . In this embodiment, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">first handle  52</span>  is relatively movable with respect to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">second handle  54</span>  in a first plane of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">motion  60</span>  in order to provide relative movement between a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">first blade  56</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">second blade  58</span>  in a second plane of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">motion  62</span>  that in this embodiment is substantially parallel to the first plane of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">motion  60</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">First handle  52</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">finger guard  64</span>  that is similar in its form and function to the finger guard described above in reference to the first embodiment of the invention. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">source  68</span>  of styptic material is provided within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">first handle  52</span>  in the manner that is described above with reference to the first embodiment. It has been found that this relative orientation between the handles and the cutting blades provides greater convenience when cutting the nails of certain types of pets, particularly smaller pets.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIG. 7 is a diagrammatical view depicting use of an article according to the preferred embodiment of the invention to apply styptic material to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">cut nail  80</span>  of an animal. As may be seen in FIG. 7, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">cut nail  80</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82">hollow center  82</span>  containing a number of veins that will bleed when cut at a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">location  84</span> . Using the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">application surface  38</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem86">styptic material  86</span>  from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">cartridge  28</span>  is packed into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">cut end  84</span>  in order to block the opening that was created in the hollow nail when the animal was quicked. The convenience of application that is afforded by the invention will become apparent when viewing FIG.  7 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is to be understood, however, that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of the invention, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed. </p>
