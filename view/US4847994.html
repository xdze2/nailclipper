                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A remotely actuated toe nail clipper includes a cylindrical tubular housing which encloses an axially reciprocating plunger rod. A leaf spring type toe nail clipper extends through a slot in a bottom portion of the housing. An actuating lever of the toe nail clipper is in engagement with the plunger rod. A scissor mechanism extends transversely through a slot in an upper portion of the housing for actuating the plunger rod. The device is particularly designed for use by individuals who have difficulty reaching their toe nails with conventional forms of nail clippers. In a second embodiment, the axially movable plunger rod is electrically actuated by a solenoid mechanism. An adjustable telescope is mounted in parallel relation to the cylindrical housing and provides an individual with a clear view of the toe nail clipper. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates to toe nail clippers, and more particularly pertains to a new and improved remotely actuated toe nail clipper particularly adapted for use by individuals who have difficulty reaching their toe nails with conventional forms of toe nail clippers. Many older individuals, overweight individuals and physically disabled individuals have extreme difficulty in trimming their toe nails with conventinal forms of toe nail clippers. In fact, many individuals find it entirely impossible to trim their toe nails with these conventional devices and are forced to seek assistance in trimming their toe nails. In order to overcome this problem, the present invention provides a toe nail clipper with a mechanism for enabling remote actuation, thus allowing individuals to trim their toe nails without extreme bending or stooping. In a second embodiment of the present invention, a telescope enables individuals with poor eyesight to have a clear view of their toe nails during a trimming operation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Description of the Prior Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Various types of toe nail clippers are known in the prior art. A typical example of such a toe nail clipper is to be found in U.S. Design Pat No. 156,233, which issued to A. Henkel on Nov. 29, 1949. This patent discloses a conventional form of leaf spring type toe nail clipper. U.S. Design Pat. No. 192,590, which issued to N. Leopoldi on Apr. 10, 1962, discloses a leaf spring type nail clipper which has a generally circular configuration. U.S. Design Pat. No. 195,614, which issued to J. Sacko on July 2, 1963, discloses a conventional leaf spring type nail clipper having a generally oval built-up finger gripping surface. U.S. Design Pat. No. 209,942, which issued to W.

                        <p>      While the above mentioned devices are suited for their intended usage, none of these devices provide a remotely actuated toe nail clipper adapted for use by individuals who cannot bend or stoop over. Additionally, none of these prior art nail clippers provide a remotely actuated toe nail clipper which utilizes a scissor mechanism to reciprocate an axially movable plunger to actuate a leaf spring type toe nail clipper. Additional features of the present invention, not contemplated by the aforesaid prior art devices, includes the provision of a telescope in conjunction with a solenoid remote actuated toe nail clipper to enable individuals who cannot bend or stoop over to conveniently trim their toe nails without assistance. Inasmuch as the art is relatively crowded with respect to these various types of toe nail clippers, it can be appreciated that there is a continuing need for and interest in improvements to such toe nail clippers, and in this respect, the present invention addresses this need and interest.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of toe nail clippers now present in the prior art, the present invention provides an improved remotely actuated toe nail clipper. As such, the general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new and improved remotely actuated toe nail clipper which has all the advantages of the prior art toe nail clippers and none of the disadvantages.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To attain this, representative embodiments of the concepts of the present invention are illustrated in the drawings and make use of a cylindrical tubular housing which encloses an axially reciprocating plunger rod. A leaf spring type toe nail clipper extends through a slot in a bottom portion of the housing. An actuating lever of the toe nail clippers is in engagement with the plunger rod. A scissor mechanism extends transversely through a slot in an upper portion of the housing for actuating the plunger rod. The device is particularly designed for use by individuals who have difficulty reaching their toe nails with conventional forms of nail clippers. In a second embodiment, the axially movable plunger rod may be electrically actuated by a solenoid mechanism. An adjustable telescope is mounted in parallel relation to the cylindrical housing and provides an individual with a clear view of the toe nail trimming operation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.

                        <p>      DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT  </p>
                    
                        <p>      With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to FIG. 1 thereof, a new and improved remotely actuated toe nail clipper embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be described.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      More specifically, it will be noted that the first embodiment 10 of the invention includes an elo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ngated hollow cylindrical tubular housing 12</span> having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> generally rectangular notch 14</span> adjacent a bottom portion thereof. A leaf spring type toe nail clipper has a pair of generally para<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">llel sp<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">aced spring steel cutting portions 16 and 17</span></span> which are loosely connected by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> pin 15</span> which allows the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">g portions 16 and 17</span></span> to be moved together and apart. An<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> actuating lever 14</span> is connected in conventional fashion to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> pin 15</span> for purposes of forcing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">g portions 16 and 17</span></span> together for trimming a toe nail. The leaf spring type toe nail clipper is of a conventional form and need not be further described herein. A scissor actuating mechanism mounted adjacent a top portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> housing 12</span>, includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> first lever portion 18</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> second lever portion 20</span> which are pivotally connected by means of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> rivet 19</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> Loop h<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">andle grips 22 and 24</span></span> are provided respectively on end portions of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> first lever 18</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> second lever 20</span>. The first and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> second<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> scissor levers 18 and 20</span></span> are mounted through a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> generally rectangular slot 25</span> and extend transversely into the interior of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> housing 12</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In FIG. 2, a side view of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> of the first embodiment of the present invention is depicted. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> housing 12</span> has a length from eighteen to twenty four inches so that an individual may place their toe nails in position between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">g elements 16 and 17</span></span> of the leaf spring type toe nail clipper and actuate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> lever 13</span> by squeezing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">s 22 and 24</span></span> of the scissor mechanism together, without excessive bending or stooping. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> may be easily utilized by an individual seated in a chair.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIG. 3 provides a top plan view of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> toe nail clipper 10</span> of the first embodiment of the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In FIG. 4, a longitudinal cross sectional view illustrates the actuating mechanism within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> housing 12</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> actuating lever 13</span> of the leaf spring type toe nail clipper has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> semi-spherical recess 11</span> which receives the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> radiused end 30</span> of an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> axially reciprocating plunger rod 28</span>. The upper end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> plunger rod 28</span> is connected by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> pivot pin 26</span> to the end portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> movable scissor lever 20</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> other scissor pivot lever 18</span> is fixed to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> housing 12</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> leaf s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">pring cutting elements 16 and 17</span></span> of the nail clippers are secured together and to the bottom portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> housing 12</span> by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> rivet 21</span>. As may now be readily understood, by squeezing<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> the sc<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">issor actuating mechanism handles 22 and 24</span></span> together, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> axial plunger rod 28</span> will be forced downwardly,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> depressing nail clippers actuation lever 13</span>, which causes the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">g elements 16 and 17</span></span> to move together in a toe nail shearing action. The various elements of the invention may be formed from metal or plastic and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> stationary scissor lever 18</span> may be secured to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> housing 12</span> by glue, welding or by other conventional fastening methods.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      With reference now to FIG. 5, a second embodiment 40 of the present invention will now be described. More specifically, the second embodiment 40 of the present invention includes an elo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">ngated hollow cylindrical tubular housing 42</span> which has an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> elongated notch 44</span> formed by the removal of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> cylindrical side wall portion 46</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> cylindrical side wall portion 46</span> forms a cover for a battery compartment within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> housing 42</span>. A conventional type of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> telescope 48</span> is secured by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> spaced<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> mounting rings 50 and 52</span></span> to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> cylindrical housing 42</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> elongated telescope body 48</span> extends in generally parallel relation with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> housing 42</span>. An<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51"> eye piece 51</span> of the telescope is mounted for adjustable axial sliding movement on a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem49"> barrel 49</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> telescope 48</span>. This allows the focus of the telescope to be adjusted. A conventional type of leaf spring nail clipper mechanism extends transversely from a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> slot 64</span> formed adjacent the bottom portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> housing 42</span>. The leaf spring type nail clipper mechanism includes<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> first 56</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> second 58</span> leaf spring cutting elements which are connected in generally parallel relation by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> pin 60</span> which extends transversely through aperatures in each of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">g elements 56 and 58</span></span>. An<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> actuating lever 62</span> engages a recess in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> pin 60</span> in conventional fashion for forcing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">g elements 56 and 58</span></span> together in a toe nail shearing cutting action. An<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> electrical push button switch 54</span> is disposed on a top end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> housing 42</span> for a purpose to be described subsequently.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIG. 6 provides a front view of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> remotely actuated toe nail clipper 40</span> of the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As shown in the side view of FIG. 7, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> telescope 48</span> is aligned with the operative portion of the leaf spring type toe nail clipper mechanism. In particular, an individual with a toe nail situated between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">g elements 56 and 58</span></span> may obtain a clear view of the toe nail trimming operation by looking through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51"> eye piece 51</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> telescope 48</span>. As previously mentioned, by axially sliding the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem49"> adjustment barrel 49</span>, the focus of the telescope may be adjusted to suit each individual user.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In FIG. 8, a top view of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> remotely actuated toe nail clipper 40</span> of the present invention is provided.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In FIG. 9, longitudinal cross sectional view taken along line 9--9 of FIG. 8 illustrates the internal working mechanisms of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> toe nail clipper 40</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> actuating lever 62</span> of the leaf spring type toe nail trimmer is secured to an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> axially movable plunger 70</span> of an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> electric solenoid 68</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> solenoid 68</span> is powered by a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> conventional batteries 72</span>. Actuation of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> solenoid 68</span> is achieved by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> push button type switch 54</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> leaf s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">pring cutting elements 56 and 57</span></span> of the toe nail trimmer are secured together and to the bottom portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> housing 42</span> by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> rivet 66</span>. These<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> leaf s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">pring elements 56, 57</span></span> provide a spring force which biases the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> actuating lever 62</span> upwardly to the illustrated position. In addition to the restorative axial spring force of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> leaf s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">pring elements 56 and 57</span></span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> solenoid 68</span> may be of a type containing an internal coil spring which biases the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> plunger 70</span> to an axially upward retracted position when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> solenoid 68</span> is not energized. The manner of use of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> toe nail clipper 40</span> according to the second embodiment is quite simple. An individual places their toe nail to be trimmed between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">g elements 56 and 57</span></span>. The proper toe nail alignment may be achieved by individuals of even very poor eye sight through the use of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> telescope 48</span>. When the toe nail is situated in the correctly aligned position, the individual depresses the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> push button switch 54</span> actuating the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> solenoid 68</span> which axially downwardly extends the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> plunger 70</span>, depressing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> attached toe nail actuation lever 62</span>. This forces the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">g elements 56 and 57</span></span> together, thus shearing the toe nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      While the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> telescope 48</span> has been described with reference to the second embodiment 40 of the present invention, it is readily apparent that this telescope may be attached by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> simila<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">r mounting rings 50 and 52</span></span> to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> toe nail clipper 10</span> of the first embodiment of the present invention. In this construction, the scissor actuating mechanism would merely extend transversely from a side portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> housing 12</span>, to allow the telescope to be positioned in alignment with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">g elements 16 and 17</span></span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention. </p>
