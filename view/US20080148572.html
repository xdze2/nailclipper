                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A nail clipper is described which can be used by a person having only one hand. The nail clipper comprises a base  32  shaped to rest on a horizontal surface and an elongate actuator  30  pivotably connected at one end to the base  32 . A first cutting edge is located on the base  32  and an opening  34  is provided in the actuator  30  to allow the nail of a finger of a hand pressing down on the actuator to be placed over the first cutting edge. A second cutting edge movable with the actuator  30  towards the first cutting edge is used to trim the nail resting on the first cutting blade when the actuator  30  is depressed. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    The present invention relates to a nail clipper which can be used to trim the nail of a finger or a toe.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    One type of nail clipper in common use is of tweezers-like construction. The nail clipper comprises two sprung blades that are pivoted to one another at one end and have two sharp parallel cutting edges at their opposite end which will trim a nail placed between them when the blades are squeezed together. The present invention is concerned with a nail clipper of such a construction as opposed to the other common type of nail clipper which resembles pliers or wire cutters.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    Because considerable force is needed to trim a nail, nail clippers are fitted with a lever arm to help squeeze their cutting edges together. The lever arm is pivoted on a pin that passes through the holes near the cutting end of the two blades and as the free end of the lever arm is moved towards the riveted end of the two blades, a projection on the lever arm forces the two blades together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    A disadvantage of such nail clippers is that they are difficult to use by people who are infirm or physically disabled. Even with the assistance of a lever arm, a person suffering from arthritis can often not apply sufficient force with one hand, in particular the left hand, to trim the nails of the other hand. It is also impossible for a disabled person who has lost one hand to use such a nail clipper to trim the nails of the single remaining hand.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    There is already known a table mount which can be used as an accessory for a conventional nail clipper. The mount is designed to rest on a horizontal surface and to hold the clipper steady with its lever arm projecting upwards. While so supported, a user can place a nail of one hand between the two cutting edges and press down on the lever arm to trim the nail. This makes it possible for a nail clipper to be used by a person suffering from arthritis or someone who has lost the use of one hand or the fingers of one hand, but still has two arms. It does not however solve the problem for a person who has totally lost the use of one arm.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0006]    According the present invention in its broadest aspect, the invention provides a nail clipper designed to trim a nail on a hand or foot being used to operate it.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    The broadest aspect of the invention is predicated on the realisation that one does not need to resort to a clipper that is self-powered or one that is operated by some other part of the body such as the forehead or the chin. Instead, by suitable rethinking of the geometry of the nail clipper, one can use the same hand or foot on which a nail is to trimmed to apply the force needed to trim the nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a nail clipper comprising a base shaped to rest on a horizontal surface and an elongate actuator pivotably connected at one end to the base, a first cutting edge located on the base, an opening in the actuator to allow the nail of finger or toe to be placed over the first cutting edge and a second cutting edge movable by the actuator towards the first cutting edge to trim the nail resting on the first cutting edge when the actuator is depressed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    The second aspect of the invention is predicated on the realisation that as pressure must be applied to an upper surface of an actuator to effect a cut while a lower surface of the actuator must be used to move the second cutting edge, it is inevitable that the actuator will itself prevent a nail of the hand or foot pressing down on the actuator from being placed between the two cutting edges. The invention circumvents this problem by allowing the nail to be trimmed or the cutting edges of the clipper to pass through the aperture formed for this purpose in the actuator.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    It is desirable for a finger or toe not to have to adopt an uncomfortable position while its nail is being trimmed. In order to achieve this, it is preferred for the actuator to have a generally flat upper surface on which a hand or foot may rest and to provide a bridge which projects above the plane of the upper surface adjacent the opening and overlies the second cutting edge. In this way, the upper of the two cutting edges can be located above the plane on which the hand or foot is placed while a nail is being trimmed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    With the same objective of comfort in mind, it is further preferred for the base to have a generally flat upper surface and an upwardly projecting rest platform for the tip of a finger or toe aligned with the opening in the actuator. This allows the lower of the two cutting edges to be located immediately below a nail, while a hand or foot is resting in a natural position on the upper surface of the actuator.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    It would be possible for each of the cutting edges to be separately secured to a respective one of the base and the actuator. However, it is preferred for the cutting edges to be formed on the ends of two sprung blades that are riveted to one another, the two blades being removably retained between the base and the actuator. The latter embodiment allows the blades of a conventional nail clipper to be used after removal of the lever arm and the pin on which the lever arm is pivoted.  </p>

                        <p>        BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]    The invention will now be described further, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:  </p>

                        <p>            [0015]      FIG. 2  shows a front perspective of a nail clipper of the invention in a raised position of the actuator, and  </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0016]      FIG. 3  is a perspective view of the nail clipper of  FIG. 2  from the rear and one side in a position in which it is ready for use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>         </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0017]    The nail clipper shown in  FIG. 1  is conventional and comprises a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">sprung blades  10</span> ,  12  riveted to one another at <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">one end  14</span>  and having accurately machined and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">aligned cutting edges  16</span>  and  18  at their opposite ends. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">pin  20</span>  passing through a hole near the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span>  and  18  acts as a pivot for a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lever arm  22</span>  having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">projection  24</span>  which acts to squeeze the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">two cutting edges  16</span>  and  18  together as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lever  22</span>  is pivoted counter clockwise as viewed. A disadvantage of such a nail clipper, which the invention seeks to overcome, is that it cannot be used by a disabled person who has lost one arm to trim the nails of the single remaining hand.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0018]    The nail clipper shown in  FIGS. 2 and 3  is designed to make use of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">cutting blades  10</span>  and  12  only of the nail clipper shown in  FIG. 1  after removal of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">pin  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lever arm  22</span> . The parts of the nail clipper shown in  FIGS. 2 and 3  act as a replacement for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">lever arm  22</span>  and make it easier for a disabled or infirm person to use the nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]    The nail clipper of  FIGS. 2 and 3  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">base  32</span>  designed to rest on a horizontal surface. An <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">elongate actuator  30</span>  has at <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">one end curved prongs  48</span>  which engage a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">pin  46</span>  formed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">base  32</span>  to act as a hinge. This allows the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">actuator  30</span>  to pivot between an open position, such as shown in  FIG. 2 , and a closed position in which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">base  32</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">actuator  30</span>  come together and nearly touch.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">actuator  30</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">generally flat upper surface  40</span>  on which the palm of a hand or the sole of a foot can be placed and an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">opening  34</span>  through which the tip of a finger or toe can pass to rest on the upper surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">base  32</span> . As can be seen more clearly in  FIG. 3 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">actuator  30</span>  also has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">bridge  42</span>  which projects above the plane of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">surface  40</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">base  32</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">projecting formation  35</span>  which defines a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">rest platform  36</span>  for the tip of a finger or toe and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">ramp  38</span>  for receiving and retaining the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blades  10</span>  and  12  of a conventional nail clipper, such as that shown in  FIG. 1 . To locate and retain the two blades, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">ramp  38</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">hole  52</span>  for locating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">rivet  14</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">small projecting nipple  50</span>  that locates in the hole for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">pin  20</span> . The top surface of the upper blade is engaged by the underside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">bridge  42</span>  so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">cutting edges  16</span>  and  18  are squeezed together as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">actuator  30</span>  is depressed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]    In use, with the nail clipper in the position shown in  FIG. 3 , the palm of a hand or sole of a foot is placed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">surface  40</span>  and the tip of a finger or toe of which the nail is to be trimmed is placed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">rest platform  36</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">base  32</span> , which is accessible through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">opening  34</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">actuator  30</span> . After the nail has been correctly positioned between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">two cutting edges  16</span>  and  18  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blades  10</span>  and  12  trapped between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">ramp surface  38</span>  and the underside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">bridge  42</span> , downward pressure is applied by the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">surface  40</span>  to squeeze the two cutting edges together and trim the nail. The mechanical advantage afforded by the actuator ensures that the nail clipper can be operated using relatively little force. The mechanical advantage is optimised by designing the nail clipper such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">bridge  42</span>  is positioned as near possible to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">pivot pin  46</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]    If the thumb nail is to be trimmed, the user must first make a fist and rest the knuckles rather the palm of the hand on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">surface  40</span> . The tip of the thumb can then be placed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">rest platform  36</span>  and trimmed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    While the nail clipper of the invention is particularly suitable for a person who has lost an arm, its ease of use with have more general appeal both to people with less severe infirmity and to able bodied people.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]    The operate the nail clipper by foot is of great benefit to any person who for any reason has difficulty in bending and reaching down to use a conventional hand operated nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]    The illustrated embodiment is used with a removable pair of blades that are joined to one another. This is preferred because it makes for a less expensive construction. The cutting edges can be honed and accurately aligned before the nail clipper is fully assembled and their alignment is not affected by play in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">hinge  46</span> ,  48 . It is nevertheless alternatively possible to mount cutting edges permanently in the base and actuator in which case separate spring means would bias the actuator into a raised position. </p>
