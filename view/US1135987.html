                        <p>  Application filed August 4, 1914.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, TrrUs A. BEECH&#39;ER, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Taft, in the county of Kern and State of California, have invented a new and Improved Knife-Blade, of which the following is a full, clear, and exact description.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My invention relates to knife blades to be used for nail cutting, and more particularly for trimming ingrowing toe nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The object of the invention is to provide a knife blade whereby in trimming the nails the knife will not cut the same to the quick, and which blade will easily and quickly trim the nails without any danger of injury to the flesh and thereby blood poisoning set in.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   With the above and other objects in view, the nature of which will more fully appear as the description proceeds, the invention consists in the novel construction, combination and arrangement of parts as herein fully described, illustrated and claimed.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the accompanying drawings, forming part of the application, similar characters of reference indicate corresponding parts in all the views, and Figure 1 is an elevation of a blade embodying my invention; Fig. 2 is a plan view of the blade at the sharp edge; Fig. 3 is a vertical section on line 3-3, Fig. 1; Fig. 4: is a modified structure of a blade; Fig. 5 is a plan of the blade looking on the sharp edge; and Fig. 6 is a vertical section on line 6-6 of Fig. 4.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring to the drawings, 7 represents one of the blades of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> jackknife 8</span>. It is self-evident that if desired the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> blade 7</span> can be secured to a fixed handle, similar to a manicuring instrument. The blade? is provided at the unsecured end with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> portion 9</span> projecting below the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> sharp edge 10</span> of the blade and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> which portion 9</span> forms the guide which protects the flesh when the nail 1s carved by the sharp edge, as w ll be seen from Fig. 2.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> Said projection 9</span> 1s dull and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> portion 11</span> which joins the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> sharp edge 10</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> side portion 9</span> may be sharp or dull as desired, as shown in Figs. 1 to 3 the same is sharp.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring to Figs. 4: to 6 inclusive, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> blade 7</span> in this case has its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> sharp edge 10</span>&#39; Specification of Letters latent.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Patented Apr. 29, 191%.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Serial No. 854,921.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  on a level with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> portion 9</span> which forms the gear and prevents injury to the flesh when cutting the nails with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> sharp edge 10</span>. In both forms the surface a of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> portio<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">ns 9 and 9</span></span> is dull and can be fiat or rounded as may be desired. The said portion in each form may be used to draw or push out the cut-off parts of the nails that may be lodged under the nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> guard 9</span> may be used on surgical instruments or on knives used for butchering or slaughtering purposes, so as to prevent the cutting of delicate parts; and it is readily seen that a blade provided with a guard as described will protect the flesh while trimming the nail, thus preventing the cutting of the nail to the quick. It will be seen that when cutting with a blade as described, the guard formed by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> portion 9</span> prevents the encroaching of the blade, generally due to the sharp point present on the blade, which sharp point in my case is substituted by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> guard 9</span> which is dull, the inroad of the blade into the nail being prevented by the guard, causing the blade to slip out when reaching the end of the blade, thus preventing injury to the toe.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   From the foregoing description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, the advantage of the construction of the device shown and method of operation thereof will be readily understood by those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains, and while I have described the principle of operation, together with the device which I now consider to be the best embodiment thereof, I desire to have it understood that the device shown is merely illustrative and that such changes may be made when desired as are within the scope of the appended claims.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having thus described my invention, I claim as new and desire to secure by Letters Patent:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1.

                        <p>   2. A knife blade havingacutting edge ter- In testimony whereof I have signed my minating with a blunt portion at the free name to this specification in the presence of end of the blade, said blunt portion being two subscribin Witnesses.   </p>
