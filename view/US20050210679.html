                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> Provided herein is an illuminating nail clipper for clipping the nails of an animal such as a dog, cat, bird, or the like which allows for the clipping of an individual nail at the desired length to prevent injury or improper length cutting for the animal. The device includes a hand-actuated clipping blade used in conjunction with an adjustable in size nail holder which includes a cutting hole and which allows the nail to be clipped to be firmly held at a particular position relative to the nail cutting blade. Using an appropriate diameter aperture of the cutting hole, the animal nail may be inserted in an aperture of size sufficient to permit the nail to penetrate a particular distance based on the diameter size of the nail, which is tapered. A light source disposed on a flexible arm or conduit can be provided to illuminate an animal&amp;#39;s nail to make it translucent, allowing the operator to see the capillaries within the nail and thus to avoid cutting to the live portion of the nail. In addition, the invention includes a comfortable, ergonomic grip which allows the handles to rest more comfortably and securely in the operator&amp;#39;s hand. </p>

                        <p>        [0002]     This invention relates to instruments useful in the grooming and maintenance of animals. More particularly, it relates to an improved nail clipper useful in controlling the length of keratinous growths, including without limitation nails and claws on dogs and cats, and talons of various birds.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0003]     Professional quality animal nail clippers used by both veterinarians and animal owners in trimming the nails of animals, such as those of dogs and cats, have been successfully made and sold for over forty years under the trademark “RESCO” by Tecla Company, Incorporated of Walled Lake, Mich. Such clippers were initially made in accordance with the principles and features of the Laing U.S. Pat. No. 2,955,354 and later pursuant to the improvements of the Clark U.S. Pat. No. 3,838,507, both incorporated herein by reference. More recently a nail clipper of this type has been successfully modified for use in clipping human artificial fingernails by employing the principles and features of the Reiswig U.S. Pat. No. 4,856,190, also incorporated herein by reference. Other prior art patents of general interest directed to guillotine-type cutters and clippers are disclosed in the following U.S. patents, the entirety of all of which are herein incorporated by reference: U.S. Pat. Nos. 165,402; 205,088; 1,347,651; 1,927,234; 2,820,292; 2,955,354; 3,101,535; 3,299,505; 3,430,340; 3,838,507; 3,845,553; 3,855,699; 3,903,596; 4,228,585; 4,449,297; 4,856,190; 5,065,513; 5,101,563; 5,123,430; and 5,533,363 all of which are herein incorporated by reference.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]     During the course of the use of a nail clipper of the prior art, the groomer typically locates the cutting jaws, blades or other cutting means about the nail which is desired to be trimmed, and actuates the cutting mechanism of the clipper, often by squeezing the handles on the clipper device. However, the nail includes not only the dead portion which is desired to be trimmed off of the animal, but also includes a live root portion from which the nail grows, which root portion includes various tissues, including blood vessels and nerves. Owing to the variability across species of the amount which the root protrudes from the limb of the animal, it is not uncommon during a nail trimming procedure for the groomer to inadvertently cut into the root portion, causing pain to the animal, in addition to bleeding and the possibility of infection of the wound so created, which is an inherent disadvantage in the prior art. Nails, claws and talons are examples of keratinous growths.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]     Thus, it is an object of the present invention to alleviate and eliminate the cutting into the root or the “quick” of a nail during a nail trimming procedure, with the “quick” being the nerve bundle and blood supply capillaries. It is a further object of the invention to provide a nail clipping tool through the use of which it is possible to alleviate and eliminate the cutting into the root of a nail during a nail trimming procedure. It is also an object of the invention to provide a nail clipper meeting the aforesaid objects, which is ergonomical to the user. These and other objects satisfied by the present invention shall become apparent from the disclosure which follows.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0006]     The present invention provides a device useful for cutting items needing to be trimmed, including nails, claws and talons of various animal and bird species. A device according to one form of the invention comprises an first handle means and a second handle means, wherein the first handle means and the second handle means are pivotally connected to one another. There is a cutting tang portion including a hole therethrough into which an item to be trimmed may be disposed. There is a housing portion inside of which is contained a means for effecting cutting of the item when disposed in the hole, wherein the means for effecting cutting is in effective mechanical contact with the first handle means and the second handle means.

                        <p>          [0024]      FIG. 5  shows a side cutaway view of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">nail clipper  20</span>  according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention in which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">battery means  61</span>  is a compact battery such as the type used in wrist watches and other consume devices requiring a compact source of electricity. In this embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">battery  61</span>  is disposed in the lamp head itself. Thus, it is seen that the present invention uses an electrical storage means (battery) to power the lamp means. In a preferred form of the invention, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">battery  18</span>  is affixed to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">first handle means  44</span> . In an alternate form of the invention, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">battery  18</span>  may be affixed to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">second handle means  42</span> . In either of these embodiments, the handle portion itself may be configured during fabrication to contain a space into which the battery may be housed. In this  FIG. 5  are also shown the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">flexible conduit  10</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">first handle means  44</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">second <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">handle means  42</span>  handle grips  40</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">spring  16</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">blade means  55</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">lever tang  59</span> , and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57">link  57</span> , which is a tiny rod or stiff wire. In this embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">handle grips  40</span>  are shown to be contoured to match the contours of the human hand.   </p>

However, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">flexible conduit means  10</span>  must also be flexible enough to be bent, straightened, and otherwise shaped as desired. Towards such end, the flexible conduit used by Black &amp; Decker company in the manufacture of its SNAKELIGHT™ flashlight is but one example of a type of conduit means suitable for use in the present invention. Another suitable material useful as the conduit means is a plastic coated metallic tubing which is comprised of a plurality of interlocking annular elements which are reminiscent of scales. The conduit means in one form of the invention is hollow, to enable passage of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">wire  53</span>  therethrough. In other embodiments, such as where the battery means is contained within the lamp head, the flexible conduit does not necessarily need to be provided with a hollow interior space through which a wire can be passed, as the wire can be on the outside of the flexible conduit. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">flexible conduit means  10</span>  may be as simple as comprising a hollow tube or wire. In addition, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lamp head  12</span>  may include one or more lenses useful for adjustably focusing the light beam emitted from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">lamp means  51</span> , to focus the light beam at a point at a desired distance from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lamp head  12</span> , as the use of such a lens or lenses for this purpose is known in the art, one example of which is utilized in the MAG-LILTE® flashlights available from MAG INSTRUMENT of Ontario, Calif. The various lamps, flashlights, and the like herein described, including their functional equivalents, are conveniently referred to as means for illumination.   </p>
