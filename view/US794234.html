                        <p>  SPECIFICATION fOIming part Of Letters Patent N0. 794,234, dated July 11, 1905.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Application filed April 6, 1903. Serial No. 151,275.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, HENRY LA (Laws, of Auburn, in the county of Cayuga and State of New York, have invented a certain new and useful Nail-Trimmer, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My invention has for its object the production of a nail-trimmer which is particularly simple in construction and highly durable and effective in use; and to this end it consists in the combinations and devices hereinafter fully set forth, and pointed out in the claims.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In describing this invention reference is had to the accompanying drawings, forming part of this specification, in which like characters designate corresponding parts in all the views.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 are respectively top plan, longitudinal sectional view, end View, and isometric view of a preferable embodiment of my invention, the nail-support and the locking member being shown in different positions in full and dotted lines in Figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 5 is a sectional view of a modified construction of knife for my invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1 and 2 are respectively the nail-support and knife of my nail-trimmer. The part 1 is generallyformed with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> side walls 8</span>, arranged at substantially right angles with the main portion of said part 1, and is provided at its front end with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> opening 4</span>:, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> convex upper face 5</span>, of soft metal, beneath and in front of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> opening 4</span> for engaging the under surface of the nail, and an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> end face 6</span> for engaging the finger or toe and regulating the cutting of the nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1n the preferable construction of my nailtrimmer the rear end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> knife 2</span> is arranged beneath the like end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> nail-support 1</span> and is extended rearwardly beyond said part 1, and the front end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> knife 2</span> is formed of less width than the contiguous main portion thereof and is provided with upward, forward, and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> downward extensions 7</span> 8 9, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> forward extension 8</span> being arranged in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> opening 4</span> and having<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> depending cars 10</span>, pivoted to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> side walls 3</span>, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> downward extension 9</span>, terminating in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> concave cutting edge 11</span>, of hard metal, cooperating with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> face 5</span> for cutting the nail. The advance surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> knife 2</span>, terminating in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> edge 11</span>, and also the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> face 6</span> of the nail-support are extended rearwardly from their opposite ends, as shown in Fig. 1, for facilitating cutting of the nail rounding. The front end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> theknife 2</span> is usually also formed with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> lengthwise corrugation 12</span> for stiffening said end and with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> notch 13</span> in the upper face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> forward extension 8</span>. Although the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> knife 2</span> is preferably composed of a single piece of steel, it will be obvious that the same may consist of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> main body 14</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> detachable blade 15</span>, as illustrated in Fig. 5.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   16 is a spring for moving the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> support 1</span> relatively to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> knife 2</span>, and 17 is a member for locking the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> support 1</span> against the action of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring 16</span>. As generally constructed the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> intermediate portion 18</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring 16</span> bears against the upper face of the intermediate part of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> knife 2</span>, and the ends of said spring are arranged between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> side walls 3</span> and provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> lateral extensions 19</span>, fixed to said side walls. By constructing the spring of a single piece of spring-wire to provide an intermediate portion and approximately parallel side arms <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">the right-angular terminals or extensions 19</span> can be readily sprung into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> openings 19</span> in the side walls of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> member 1</span>. This arrangement will insure the proper disposition of the spring, permitting the spring to be easily attached and detached and insuring the same against accidental displacement when in its operative position. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> locking member 17</span> is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> depressed rear 1</span> end to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> knife 2</span> at the rear of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> support 1</span>. Its intermediate portion detachably engages the upper face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> support 1</span>, and its front end is formed with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> point 20</span>, detachably arranged in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> notch 13</span>. The under face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> member 17</span> is usually provided with a roughened surface for filing the nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   By reference to Fig. 1 it will be observed that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> end face 6</span> is in the form of a projecting lip extending longitudinally from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> member 1</span>, and the surface for engaging the finger or toe is provided with stop means, conveniently illustrated as being the ends of the side walls of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> member 1</span>. The rigid upstanding edges of these side walls will insure a uniform cut being made in each instance.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The construction and operation of my nailtrimmer will now be readily understood upon reference to the foregoing description and the accompanying drawings, and it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that more or less change may be made therein without departing from the spirit of my invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having thus fully described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is-   </p>
