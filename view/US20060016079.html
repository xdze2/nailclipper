                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> Nail clippers having both shielded cutting blades to prevent intentional or accidental injury and an integral means for collecting clipped nails. The nail clippers include two hollow cylindrical housings each having both a closed and open end. The edges of the open ends of both housings each have a corresponding concave sharpened section, forming the cutting edges of a nail clipping slot. The housings are both slideably connected to and spring biased against each other. A nail inserted into the nail clipping slot is clipped by squeezing the housings together. Clipped nails are collected in the closed end of one of the housings. The closed end may be opened and/or removed to discard the clippings. </p>

                        <p>      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]     1. Field of the Invention   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]     The present invention relates to fingernail and toenail clippers and, more particularly, to clippers for cutting the distal end of the nail plate wherein the cutting edge is shielded and the structure of the clippers further comprises an integral clipping collector.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]     2. Description of the Prior Art   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]     Conventional finger and toenail clippers are almost invariably comprised of lever-actuated jaws having exposed sharpened edges. The lever is attached to a post that that is fixedly mounted at one end to the first jaw and slidably mounted at the other end to the second jaw. The jaws are held open by a natural spring bias. They are closed by manipulating the lever, which compresses the second jaw towards the first. The distal end of the nail plate is placed between the sharp jaw edges and is cut as the edges come together. U.S. Pat. No. 4,637,137 to Husain is one example of nail clippers having this basic structure.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]     There are at least three primary disadvantages to the structure of conventional nail clippers. A first disadvantages is that the cutting edges on each jaw are exposed. A second disadvantages is that there is no integral guard that would prevent the user from cutting the nail too far down. Given the exposed cutting edges and lack of safety guard, conventional clippers may cause accidental injury if used by children or in an irresponsible manner. There is also the potential for such clippers to be used as a weapon. A third notable disadvantage is that the conventional nail clippers spew out all nail clippings, leaving an unsanitary mess behind. The Husain &#39;137 patent attempts to provide a safety guard to prevent the user from cutting the nail down too far, but it does not address the problems of the exposed cutting edge or scattered nail clippings.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]     U.S. Pat. No. 2,540,782 to Hansen discloses a non-conventional nail clipper structure. The nail clippers comprise a first housing slidably mounted within a second housing. A compression spring extends the length of the first housing and rests on an abutment extending the length of the second housing. The second housing has nail insertion slot and both the housings are contoured over the length of the housing on the slot side to match the curvature of a finger. The inside of the first housing is further defined by a knife edge. If the housing ends are squeezed together, such that the first housing slides against the resistance of the spring into the second housing, a finger nail inserted into the nail slot would be clipped by the knife edge. An outlet opening in the second housing allows the clipped nails to be expelled.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]     A number of disadvantages are associated with the Hansen &#39;782 nail clippers. First, users may be reluctant to stick their fingernail in the slot to be clipped because the cutting edge is not visible. Second, since the nail plate must pass through a slot the thickness of which is at least the sum of the thickness of both housing before reaching the cutting edge, the user may not be able to cut the nail as close to the hyponychium (point of attachment between the skin of the finger or toe and the distal end of the nail) as desired. Third, the matching concave contours of the housings, nail slot, and cutting edge allows the shape of the clipped nail to match that of the finger tip, but does not push the fingertip skin away from the nail to prevent accidental cutting of the fingertip skin and to allow the cutting edge to cut as close to the hyponychium as possible. Lastly, while the Hansen &#39;782 nail clippers provide an outlet for expelling the clipped nails, they do not provide a means to collect the clipped nails and expel them as desired (i.e. over a trash can).   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]     Therefore, it would be advantageous over the prior art to provide finger- or toe-nail clippers having shielded cutting edge(s) in order to prevent intentional or accidental injury. It would further be advantageous over the prior if such nail clippers were structured to allow the user to view the cutting edge in operation and to clip the nail as close as possible to the hyponychium without causing injury to the finger or toe. Lastly, it would be advantageous to provide an integral vessel for collecting clipped nails, with removable cover to allow convenient discarding at will.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0010]     It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide effective fingernail and toenail clippers having a shielded, but visible, cutting edge for preventing intentional or accidental injury.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]     It is another object of the present invention to provide nail clippers having an integral vessel for collecting clipped nails, with removable cover to allow convenient discarding at will.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]     The foregoing and other objects are accomplished by providing a nail clipper formed by a first and second cylindrical housing sections, each with the same diameter and each having both a closed and open end. The closed end of the first housing captures clipped nails and is openable. The first and second housings are both spring biased against each other and slidably engaged and connected together.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]     A guide/connector, connects the two housings and is essentially cylindrical in shape. It is inset partially within and mounted to the first housing. It is telescopically and slidably engaged into the second housing and connected thereto by a connection comprising three angularly-spaced longitudinal slots indented (or cut) into the guide/connector, and three corresponding rivets protruding into the slots from the second housing section.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0014]     Corresponding edges of the open ends of the first and second housings are further defined by corresponding concave sections each sharpened to form a first and second cutting edge, respectively, of a nail cutting slot. The concave contour of the cutting edges does not extend the length of the housings but rather tapers to form a dimple around the nail cutting slot.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0015]     The guide/connector is further defined by a cutaway that allows a finger or toe nail to be inserted into the nail slot and also accommodates and guides the concave edge of the second housing as it slides towards the first housing.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0016]     Spring loaded action of the nail clippers is provided by a compression spring mounted inside the guide/connector, above the edge of the first housing, and abutting the closed end of the second housing.  </p>
                    
                        <p>       </p>

The facing edges of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">second housing sections  10</span> ,  20  are further defined by corresponding indentations that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">define concave lips  14</span> ,  24 , the facing edges within the concavity being sharpened to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">form opposing cutting edges  15</span> ,  25 . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">tubular guide/connector  30</span>  having an external diameter conforming to the interior of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">second housing sections  10</span> ,  20  is fixedly anchored in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">second section  10</span>  and is slidably inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">first housing section  20</span> . When the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">second housing sections  10</span> ,  20  are interconnected by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">guide/connector  30</span>  a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail cutting slot  40</span>  is defined, flanked by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">two corresponding cutting edges  15</span> ,  25 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]     As seen in  FIG. 2 , the contour of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">concave lips  14</span> ,  24  does not extend the length of the housings but rather both taper inwardly to collectively form a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">finger-tip-sized recess  50</span>  around the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail cutting slot  40</span> . One&#39;s finger-tip can be comfortably seated in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">recess  50</span>  with fingernail oriented into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail cutting slot  40</span> , and the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">second housing sections  10</span> ,  20  compressed together to trim the fingernail between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">two corresponding cutting edges  15</span> ,  25 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]      FIG. 3  is a perspective view of the nail clippers of  FIGS. 1 and 2  showing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">guide/connector  30</span>  that <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">joins housing sections  10</span>  and  20 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">Guide/connector  30</span>  is essentially cylindrical in shape. One end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">guide/connector  30</span>  is partially inserted into and is fixedly mounted within (i.e. by welds, screws, bolts, etc.) the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first housing section  10</span>  adjacent its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">open end  12</span> . The other end the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">guide/connector  30</span>  is partially inserted into but slidably and telescopically engaged within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second housing  20</span> . In the preferred embodiment, this telescopic engagement between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second housing  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">guide/connector  30</span>  is accomplished with th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">ree angularly-spaced longitudinal slots  33</span>  indented (or cut) into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">guide/connector  30</span> , and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">three corresponding rivets  23</span>  protruding into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">slots  33</span>  from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second housing section  20</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">Slots  33</span>  are of predetermined length to allow a limited degree of sliding freedom. Thus, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">pins  2<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">3</span>  sliding within slots  33</span>  allow the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second housing  20</span>  to slide towards and away from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first housing  10</span>  without detaching.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">guide/connector  30</span>  is further defined by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">cutaway  35</span>  to provide a clearance around the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">finger-tip-sized recess  50</span>  about the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail cutting slot  40</span>  that allows a finger or toe nail to be freely inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail slot  40</span> , and also to accommodate and guides the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">concave edge  24</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second housing  20</span>  as it slides towards the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first housing  10</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]     The first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">second housing sections  10</span> ,  20  are biased apart to provide a spring-loaded action, and this is accomplished with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">compression spring  60</span>  mounted inside the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">guide/connector  30</span> , above the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">open end  12</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first housing  10</span>  and abutting an abutment means in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second housing  20</span> . In the preferred embodiment an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">L-shaped arm  61</span>  is attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">guide/connector  30</span>  and extends vertically along the center axis of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">device  100</span>  towards the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">closed end  21</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">spring  60</span>  is secured to and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">rests upon arm  61</span>  at one end and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">abuts closed end  21</span>  at its other end.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">closed end  11</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first housing section  10</span>  serves as an integral container for collecting clipped nails, and incorporates a removable closure for emptying trimmings. For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">closed end  11</span>  may be designed for easy hinged-opening, or removal (e.g., by jointed, compression-fit, or screw-threaded end cap) in order to dispose of collected nail clippings. In the illustrated embodiment the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first housing  10</span>  is subdivided into a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">primary vessel  10</span>   a  with screw-threaded rim and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">cooperating screw-threaded cap  10</span>   b  for removable attachment. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">cap  10</span>   b  is preferably of sufficient length to serve as a container for collected clipped nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">closed ends  11</span> ,  21  are preferably textured with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">non-slip surface  70</span>  to prevent slipping of the fingers during use of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">device  100</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]     In operation, a user places their fingernail in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">nail cutting slot  40</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">visible cutting edges  15</span> ,  25 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">guide/connector  30</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">recess  50</span>  surrounding the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">cutting slot  40</span>  serves to shield the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">cutting edges  15</span> ,  25 , limiting their exposure and thereby preventing accidental or intentional injury. As the nail is inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">slot  40</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">tapered edge  51</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">recess  50</span>  pushes in on the fingertip skin pulling the skin adjacent the hyponychium down and away from the nail. This allows the user to cut the nail close to the hyponychium without risk of cutting the fingertip skin. Once the nail is inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">slot  40</span>  to the desired depth, the user squeezes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">closed ends  11</span> ,  21  of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">second housings  10</span> ,  20  together against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">spring  60</span>  bias and thereby slides the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second housing  20</span>  on its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">pin  23<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"></span>  along slot  33</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">guide  30</span>  towards the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first housing  10</span> . The nail is clipped as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">cutting edges  15</span> ,  25  of the first and second housings are engaged. The clipped nail falls to the through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">hollow first housing  10</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">closed end  11</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">closed end  11</span>  of the first housing is later opened or removed for emptying the clipped nails at will.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0029]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">device  100</span>  of the present invention may be constructed using a variety of materials, including metal and durable plastic. In addition the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">device  100</span>  may be constructed in a variety of sizes to accommodate infant, child, and adult-size finger and toe nails. In all such variations it provide effective fingernail and toenail clipping with a shielded, but visible, cutting edge that prevents intentional or accidental injury. In addition, the integral collection vessel for clipped nails, and removable cover, allow more convenient disposal.   </p>
