                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A nail splitter for splitting a ingrown toenail in order to remove the severed portion of the nail from the soft tissue of the digit and allow the nail to grow back flat to prevent further irritation of the soft tissue of the digit. The device is of a scissor or plier type structure having an elongated, flat separator tongue with a rounded tip and a sharp blade connected to the separator tongue by a hinged connection. The blade overlies the flat separator tongue and can be pressured to make a slicing engagement with the upper side of the separator tongue to sever the nail between the separator tongue and the blade. The tip of the blade has a hawk-nosed configuration that overlies the rounded nose of the separator tongue when the blade is pressed into engagement position. The hawk-nosed tip of the blade overlies the rounded nose of the flat depressor tongue so that the structure can be pushed beneath the cuticle of the toe without severing the cuticle to reach the base of the nail and a second cutting action can be performed to sever the portion of the nail beneath the cuticle. Once the entire nail has been separated, the hawk-nosed tip of the blade can be maneuvered to engage the severed portion of the nail to assist in removing it from the soft tissue of the digit. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates generally to a device for use in removing ingrown toenails and more particularly to a nail splitter for implementing a procedure known as a &#34;wedge resection&#34;. The device has a plier or scissor type construction, including co-acting jaws used to split a nail in order to remove the ingrown portion of the toenail with minimal intrusive procedure and trauma to the infected area.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that ingrown nails (usually toenails) are a common malady that often must be corrected by an outpatient operative procedure. The phrase &#34;ingrown toenail&#34; is used to describe the condition where the edge of the toenail or fingernail grows into the soft tissue of the digit, causing inflammation, and on occasion an abscess. When an ingrown toenail occurs, the surgical procedure used to correct it to split the nail and remove the portion of the nail that has turned and grown radially into the soft tissue of the digit.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The corrective procedure for ingrown toenails is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,936,322 issued to DeSantis on Jun. 26, 1990. DeSantis describes the procedure, and in FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrates the procedure of splitting the nail so that the ingrown portion of the nail can be removed. DeSantis&#39; description of the procedure is done in conjunction with the description of his invention for a &#34;Ingrown Toenail Part Remover&#34; which he describes and claims in the referenced patent.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The DeSantis device is a radical departure from the more traditional prior art devices used for this procedure. As DeSantis describes, the prior art devices include pliers and scissor type devices, such devices being by far and away the norm for use in executing this procedure. DeSantis recognizes that prior art safety blades have certain drawbacks. Further, he recognizes that the use of separate depressors to separate the soft tissue of the nail can be awkward to use and may result in unnecessary trauma to the affected region because of multiple insertions of separators, cutting devices, etc.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The object of Applicant&#39;s invention is to overcome the deficiencies of the prior art with a more traditional instrument which is an improvement over the instruments with which this procedure is currently undertaken. To that end, Applicant&#39;s device is a scissor or plier type instrument having a flat separator tongue with a rounded nose which is hingedly connected to a cutter blade for severing the nail once the separator tongue has been inserted between the nail and the soft tissue.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Another problem that exists with this procedure using traditional instruments is that the nail, which extends approximately 2-3 mm beneath the cuticle must be cut throughout its full length. Prior art devices have traditionally involved cutting the cuticle as well as the nail in order to cut the nail to its base. Cutting the cuticle generates an unnecessary trauma to the region and may result in infection and delays in the healing process. Therefore, another object of Applicant&#39;s invention is to provide a device for implementing this procedure which avoids cutting the cuticle while at the same time enabling the device to cut the nail throughout its entire length. To this end, Applicant&#39;s cutting device provides a hawk-nose on the tip of the cutter blade which mates with the rounded nose of the separator tongue so that when the blade is pressed against the tongue and the nail as cut, the cut can be made to a point immediately adjacent the cuticle. The blade is then opened slightly so that the hawk-nosed portion of the blade will slide under the cuticle when the device is pushed toward the base of the nail, thereby separating the cuticle from the nail and allowing the blade to cut the base of the nail but avoiding any cut to the cuticle. Once the hawk-nose of the blade is inserted beneath the cuticle and extended to the base of the nail, the blade can be once again pressed against the separator tongue so that the nail can be cut throughout its entire length. The device can then be used to capture the severed portion of the nail because of the overlapping engagement of the hawk-nosed portion of the cutting blade with the separator tongue. When those two elements are engaged about the severed portion of the nail, one can gently remove the severed portion of the nail from the toe. A device providing these features and enabling this procedure to be effectively performed in the fashion described is not currently available in the prior art.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      My invention is of a nail splitter for splitting a ingrown toenail in order to remove the severed portion of the nail from the soft tissue of the digit and allow the nail to grow back flat to prevent further irritation of the soft tissue of the digit. The device is of a scissor or plier type structure having an elongated, flat separator tongue with a rounded tip and a sharp blade connected to the separator tongue by a hinged connection. The blade overlies the flat separator tongue and can be pressured to make a slicing engagement with the upper side of the separator tongue to sever the nail between the separator tongue and the blade. The tip of the blade has a hawk-nosed configuration that overlies the rounded nose of the separator tongue when the blade is pressed into engagement position. The hawk-nosed tip of the blade overlies the rounded nose of the flat depressor tongue so that the structure can be pushed beneath the cuticle of the toe without severing the cuticle to reach the base of the nail and a second cutting action can be performed to sever the portion of the nail beneath the cuticle. Once the entire nail has been separated, the hawk-nosed tip of the blade can be maneuvered to engage the severed portion of the nail to assist in removing it from the soft tissue of the digit.  </p>

                        <p>      DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The description of the preferred embodiment will be best understood when reference is made to the foregoing drawings wherein the features of the invention are illustrated and like numerals are consistently used throughout the various figures.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to FIG. 1, a side view of the device is illustrated. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail splitter 10</span> includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutter 12</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> stabilizing handle 16</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pressure handle 18</span>. FIG. 2 shows a bottom view of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> assembled nail splitter 10</span> and FIG. 3 shows an end view of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> assembled nail splitter 10</span> looking from the direction of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutter 12</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span> toward the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> stabilizing handle 16</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pressure handle 18</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As can be seen from FIGS. 1, 11, 12 and 14, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail splitter 10</span> is of a scissor or plier type construction with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span> hingedly connected to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutter 12</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In FIG. 4, there is illustrated the unitary construction of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> stabilizing handle 16</span>. FIGS. 8 and 9 illustrate the unitary construction of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutter 12</span> with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pressure handle 18</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> com<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">bination cutter 12</span>/pressure handle 18</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> pivot point 34</span> which is co-axial with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> hole 32</span> passing through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> combination sepa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">rator tongue 14</span>/stabilizing handle 16</span> when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail splitter 10</span> is assembled. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail splitter 10</span> is then hinged by passing a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> pivot 22</span> through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> hole 32</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> pivot point 34</span>. Other similar hinging structures may be employed in order to hingedly connect the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> combination sepa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">rator tongue 14</span>/stabilizing handle 16</span> with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> com<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">bination cutter 12</span>/pressure handle 18</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As can be seen from FIGS. 5 and 6, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> combination sepa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">rator tongue 14</span>/stabilizing handle 16</span> is formed with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> upward<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">ly extending arms 28, 28</span></span>&#39; and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutter 12</span> has the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> pivot point 34</span> passing through it which aligns with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> hole 32</span> passing through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> upward<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">ly extending arms 28, 28</span></span>&#39;.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Looking at FIGS. 1 and 11, it can be seen that<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> spring 20</span> is connected to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pressure handle 18</span> and slidably engaged against the underside of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> stabilizing handle 16</span> so that in the standing mode, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail splitter 10</span> is pressed to an open position by the bias of the spring (see FIG. 11). When the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail splitter 10</span> is being used, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> stabilizing handle 16</span> is held in the user&#39;s palm with the user&#39;s fingers curled about the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pressure handle 18</span>. Collapsing pressure is applied on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pressure handle 18</span> moving it against the bias of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> spring 20</span> toward the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> stabilizing handle 16</span> into the closed position shown in both FIGS. 1 and 2. By virtue of the hinged connection of the device about the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> pivot 22</span>, moving the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pressure handle 18</span> towards the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> stabilizing handle 16</span> causes a downward movement of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutter 12</span> toward the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to FIGS. 4 and 8, there is shown formed within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> combination sepa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">rator tongue 14</span>/stabilizing handle 16</span> a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> shoulder 24</span>. Viewing FIG. 8, there is shown the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> cam 24</span>&#39; formed in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutter 12</span> proximate the point of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> pivot 22</span>. When the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail splitter 10</span> is being used, the collapsing pressure applied to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pressure handle 18</span> moving it in the direction of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> stabilizing handle 16</span> will tend to force the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutter 12</span> against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span>. However, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> cam 24</span>&#39;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> engages shoulder 24</span> at a point when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> cutting edge 38</span> is proximate the upper surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span> but separated from the upper surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span> by approximately 0.001 inches. Thus, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> cutting edge 38</span> will be allowed to perform its cutting function as hereinafter described against an ingrown toenail, but will not come into engagement with the upper surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span>. Since the nail will be split through substantially all of its thickness, the ingrown portion of the toenail will be easily separated from the balance of the nail; however, the cutting edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail splitter 10</span> will not be dulled and therefore the instrument can be used repeatedly without having to be resharpened or replaced. Further, sharpening of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> cutting edge 38</span> would be practically impossible because in order to perform the procedure for which this instrument is designed, the plane of the upper surface of lo the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span> must remain substantially parallel to the line of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> cutting edge 38</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to FIGS. 5 and 7, the tip of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span> is shown in more detail. The tip of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> bull-nose 30</span> which is rounded rather than terminating in a sharp, pointed or cutting edge. By constructing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span> in a flat, thin, elongated shape as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> rounded bull-nose 30</span> at the tip of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span> can be used to separate the toenail from the soft tissue of the toe with minimal trauma to the patient.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As has been indicated, prior art devices having a scissor type construction generally have a sharp, pointed edge which tends to cut the soft tissue beneath the toenail. Use of devices of the type of the prior art often results in substantial traumatization of the area and may lead to further complications. While this procedure is being conducted while the digit is anesthetized, the pain that the patient may suffer later is exaggerated when a vertical cut of the soft tissue occurs. With use of the nail splitter of the present invention, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span> will have a minimal intrusive effect while sliding beneath the toenail and separating the soft tissue from the nail itself. Thus, the patient suffers significantly reduced post-procedure pain and likelihood of complication.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIGS. 11-14 show the device of the present invention in operation. FIG. 13 shows an illustration of a toe and an ingrown toenail. The toe has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> nail 42</span> with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> base 48</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> tip 50</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> base 48</span> is beneath the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> cuticle 46</span> and the nail shown in FIG. 13 has an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> ingrown section 52</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The first step of the procedure using the nail splitter of the present invention is to insert the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span> beneath the tip of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> nail 50</span> and to separate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> nail 42</span> from the soft tissue of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> toe 40</span>. This initial step of the procedure is shown in FIG. 11. The separator lo tongue, as indicated, has<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> bull-nose 30</span> and a flat, thin, elongated configuration which allows it to serve as a separator rather than a cutter to separate the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> nail 42</span> from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> toe 40</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Once the nail has been separated from the toe by insertion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> stabilizing handle 16</span> is held in the palm of the user&#39;s hand and pressure is applied by pulling t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">he fingers wrapped around pressure handle 18</span> toward the palm and causing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutter 12</span> to move toward the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span> and split the nail as can be seen in FIG. 14. Once the nail is split to approximately the location of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> cuticle 46</span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> hawk-nose 36</span> (see FIG. 8) of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutter 12</span> fits over the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> bull-nose 30</span> (as is best illustrated in FIG. 7) of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span>. The pressure of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> spring 20</span> is then allowed to create a slight opening of the engagement between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutter 12</span> so as to be separated by the thickness of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> nail 42</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> hawk-nose 36</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutter 12</span> is then slit along the top of the nail as the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> separator tongue 14</span> separates the base of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> nail 48</span> from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> toe 40</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> hawk-nose 36</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutter 12</span> will slide beneath the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> cuticle 46</span> as is seen in FIG. 12 so that the base of the nail can be split without damaging the cuticle. A second action of applying engaging pressure against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pressure handle 18</span> in the direction of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> stabilizing handle 16</span> is implemented to make the final cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      After the nail is split throughout its entire length, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> hawk-nose 36</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> cutter 12</span> can be engaged over the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> ingrown section 52</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> toenail 42</span> to assist with removal of the split portion of the nail, namely the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> ingrown section 52</span>. In this procedure, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> ingrown section 52</span> is removed to allow the nail to grow back straight and avoid the traumatization of the area generally experienced by patients with this malady.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      By use of the present invention, the wedge resection procedure for which this device is designed can be implemented with minimum traumatization to the area, while reducing the pain associated with the procedure along with the healing period that the patient must experience once the procedure is completed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Thus, although there have been described particular embodiments of the present invention of a new and useful &#34;Device for Implementing a Wedge Resection Procedure to Remove an Ingrown Toenail&#34;, it is not intended that such references be construed as limitations upon the scope of this invention except as set forth in the following claims. Further, although there have been described certain dimensions used in the preferred embodiment, it is not intended that such dimensions be construed as limitations upon the scope of this invention except as set forth in the following claims. </p>
