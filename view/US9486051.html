                        <p>      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Various types of nail clippers are known in the prior art. However, what has been needed is a nail clipper apparatus including a nail clipper, a pair of elongated gripping members attachable to each other with a spring loaded hinge, a bottom end of each of a pair of tension rods mounted to an upper surface of an upper arm of an actuating lever of the nail clipper, and a top end of each of the pair of tension rods attached to a bottom surface of a lower gripping member of the pair of gripping members. What has been further needed is a top side of a push rod attached to an upper gripping member of the pair of gripping members, and a bottom side of the push rod slidably disposed atop the upper surface of the upper arm of the actuating lever. A magnifying lens is disposed above the cutting portion of the nail clipper. Each of an open position and a closed position of the pair of gripping members coincides with an open position and a closed position of the nail clipper. A length of the nail clipper is substantially one-third of a length of each of the pair of gripping members. Thus, the nail clipper apparatus eliminates the need for a user to strain his body into an uncomfortable position while clipping his toenails. Furthermore, the nail clipper apparatus provides greater convenience and maneuverability as a result of the pair of elongated gripping members and the magnifying lens.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates to nail clippers, and more particularly, to a nail clipper apparatus.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The general purpose of the present nail clipper apparatus, described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a nail clipper which has many novel features that result in a nail clipper apparatus which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by prior art, either alone or in combination thereof.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To accomplish this, the present nail clipper apparatus includes a nail clipper having an upper arm, a lower arm, and an actuating lever. Each of the upper arm and the lower arm has a cutting portion, an upper surface, a lower surface, a back end opposite the cutting portion, a right edge, and a left edge. The actuating lever has an upwardly facing fin-shaped stopper disposed on an upper surface proximal a back end of the actuating lever. The nail clipper has an open position and an alternate closed position. Each of an upper gripping member of a pair of elongated gripping members and a lower gripping member of a pair of elongated gripping members has a right surface, a left surface, a top surface, and a bottom surface. A spring loaded hinge attaches the upper gripping member with the lower gripping member. A length of the nail clipper is substantially one-third of a length of each of the pair of gripping members.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The nail clipper apparatus further includes a pair of tension rods. The pair of tension rods includes a right tension rod and a left tension rod. Each of the right tension rod and the left tension rod has a top end and a bottom end. The bottom end of each of the right tension rod and the left tension rod is mounted to the upper surface of the upper arm the nail clipper along the back end proximal the right edge and the left edge, respectively, wherein the top end of each of the right tension rod and the left tension rod is attached to the bottom surface of the lower gripping member proximal the front edge. A top side of a push rod is attached to the right surface of the upper gripping member proximal the bottom surface, and a bottom side of the push rod is slidably disposed atop the upper surface of the upper arm of the actuating lever. The bottom side of the push rod is configured to slide across the upper surface of the actuating lever from the back end to the stopper and, alternatively, from the stopper to the back end. A width of the push rod substantially conforms to a width of the fin-shaped stopper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The pair of gripping members is perpendicularly disposed above the nail clipper and has an open position and an alternate closed position. The pair of gripping members is in the open position when the nail clipper is in the open position and the bottom side of the push rod is disposed atop the upper surface of the actuating lever adjacent to the back end. The pair of gripping members is in the closed position when the nail clipper is in the closed position and the bottom side of the push rod is disposed atop the upper surface of the actuating lever adjacent to the stopper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A magnifying lens is disposed above the cutting portion of the nail clipper. The magnifying lens has a pair of rearwardly extending arms having a slot disposed between each of the pair of arms. The pair of tension rods and the push rod are disposed within the slot. A width of the slot substantially conforms to the width of the push rod. An adjustment screw is attachable to a rear edge of each of the pair of arms. The adjustment screw is configured to tighten the pair of arms around the pair of tension rods and the push rod in order to hold the magnifying lens in place above the cutting portion of the nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The nail clipper apparatus optionally includes a locking clasp, a pair of rubberized covers, and a pair of triangulated attachments. The locking clasp has a top area and a bottom area. The top area of the locking clasp is hingedly attached to the right surface of the upper gripping member proximal the top side of the push rod, and the bottom area of the locking clasp is selectively engageable around a circular clasp disposed on the right surface of the lower gripping member proximal the top end of each of the tension rods. Each of the pair of covers has a front side. A first of the pair of covers is continuously disposed around the upper gripping member from a rear side of the upper gripping member to proximal the top side of the push rod, and a second of the pair of covers is continuously disposed around the lower gripping member from a rear side of the lower gripping member to proximal the top end of each of the tension rods. The pair of attachments includes an upwardly facing upper attachment and a downwardly facing lower attachment. The upper attachment is disposed atop the first of the pair of covers adjacent to the front side, and the lower attachment is disposed on the second of the pair of covers proximal the front side.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Thus has been broadly outlined the more important features of the present tool storage box with a magnetic sheet so that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.  </p>
