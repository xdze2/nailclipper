                        <p>  SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 327,065, dated September 29, 1885.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Application filed June 1, 1885. (N0 model.)   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, GEORGE D. BURTON, of Boston, county of Suffolk, and State of Massachusetts, have invented an Improvement in Apparatus for Trimming and Cleaning Finger-N ails, of which the following description, in connection with the accompanying drawings, is a specification, like letters on the drawings representing like parts.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention has for its object the production of an instrument especially adapted for trimming and cleaning finger-nails, the instrument being easily operated and cheaply constructed.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My improved implementhas cutting-jaws curved to insure for the nail the proper curved cut. The handles carrying the cutting-jaws are pivoted together, like shears, a spring normally acting to keep the cuttingedges separated.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure l&#39;shows in perspective an implement constructed in accordance with my invention; Fig. 2, a rear side view thereof; Fig. 3, a modification to be referred to; Fig. 4:, an edge view of Fig. 2; Fig. 5, an enlarged cross-section of the cutting jaws, taken on the dotted line :20 :0, Figs. 1 and 3; and Fig. 6 shows the implement in operation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The hand-levers A B are connected together by a pivot, a, and are normally held spread apart by a fiat spring, I), secured to one of the said levers, as A at 0, its free end bearing against the other lever, B, and being provided with a slot or guideway, d, to re ceive a pin, 6, rigidly secured to the lever B, the slot and pin guarding against displacement of the spring.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The cuttingjaws m n are integral with the hand-levers A B, respectively, and are curved, as shown in Fig. 5, to conform, substantially, to the proper curve for the finger-nail to be trimmed, and the ends of the said jaws are also curved, as at m it, (see Fig. 6,) to form lips, either of which may be easily inserted beneath a nail to clean it.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The rear faces of the jaws m it may be roughened, as at m of, (see Fig. 2,) to serve the purpose of a file to be employed as usual. The cutting-edges come squarely together and carried in the pocket, I supply the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> ends thereof 5</span> 5 with a fastening consisting of a link, 0, loosely connected with one lever, 0, while its opposite end engages a hook, 0, of the other lever.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  If desired, the cutting-jaws m it may be bent aside, as at 19, Fig. 3, to extend forward out of 6c the plane of the hand-levers A B.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The operation of the implement is as follows: The hand -levers having been grasped by the operator, the cuttingjaws are brought together, similar to a pair of scissors, and the nail is trimmed. The file or roughened surface m a may then be employed, if desired. and the implement turned in the hand of the operator, as shown in Fig. 6, when the curved lip m or a may be used to clean the nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The implement is small and simple, may be conveniently carried in the pocket, and for the use to which it is adapted it is both efficient and time-saving.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  I claim 1. Theherein-describedimplement for trimming and cleaning finger-nails, it consisting of the pivoted hand-levers A B, having cutting-jaws m n. curved,as shown and described, and having laterally-curved ends on n, the cutting edges meeting, but not passing each other, substantially as described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2. Theherein-described implement fortrimming and cleaning finger-nails, it consisting of the pivoted hand-levers A B, having cutting-jaws ma, curved,as shown and described, and having laterally-curved ends at n, the cutting-edges meeting, but not passing each other, the rear sides of the jaws being made like a file, substantially as described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In testimony whereof Ihave signed my name to this specification in the presence of two subscribing witnesses.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  GEO. D. BURTON.   </p>
