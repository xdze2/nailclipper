                        <p> A hand tool having hinged nipping or cutting blades and handles that are squeezed to effect the cutting or nipping action, at least one of the handles being profiled in cross section to accept and retain a slide-on cushion. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    This invention relates to hand-tool grips, particularly, but not exclusively for nippers, especially podiatry nail nippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0002]    A problem with podiatrists&#39; nail nippers is that they give rise to repetitive strain injury (RSI) when used perhaps hundreds of times a day by podiatrists.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    This is especially true of multiple use nippers that are not especially sharp, the impact of the blades one against the other when the nail is penetrated being transmitted through the handles to the podiatrist&#39;s hand.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    Similar problems arise also with mechanics&#39; pliers and snips.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    It is a problem to provide cushioning for the handles that is adequate to cushion the impact yet is easy and inexpensive to attach to the handles. Often, a sleeve is applied which is profiled to fit the handle, sometimes cushioning is glued in place. These problems arise especially in the case of instruments that need to be sterilised, as the sterilisation process can affect adhesives. It is also desirable, in the case of single-use, disposable instruments, that the cost be kept to a minimum.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0006]    The present invention provides hand tools such as podiatry nippers that have improved handle provision.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    The invention comprises a hand tool comprising hinged nipping or cutting blades and handles that are squeezed to effect the cutting or nipping action, at least one of the handles being profiled in cross section to accept and retain a slide-on cushion.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    The handle may be bifurcated and the cushion have an â€˜Hâ€™ shaped cross section.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    The cushion may have an end-stop that abuts the end of the handle remote from the blades.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    The handle may be recessed from the hinge end by the thickness of the cushion to give a smooth transition at the hinge end of the cushion.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    The hand tool may comprise an internal spring.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    The blades of podiatrists&#39; nippers may be razor sharp, and may have a flat cut. Razor sharpness may be a feature of disposable, single use, or at least limited use nail nippers, and further reduces the incidence of RSI as less force is required to cut through a nail than with multiple use nippers, which are manufactured less than razor sharp in order that they maintain a constant sharpness throughout their life. Razor sharp nippers dull quickly, but this is, of course, of no consequence in a disposable implement.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]    Nail nippers may be enclosed in a sterile pack, and may be sterilised by gamma radiation. The pack may contain other podiatry equipment such as a file, scissors, a scalpel and an emery board.  </p>
                    
                        <p>       </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>       </p>
                    
                        <p>        BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0014]    A hand tool according to the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:  </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0015]      FIG. 1  is a view of a podiatrists&#39; nail nipper and a slide on cushion; and  </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0016]      FIG. 2  is a cross-section of the cushion of  FIG. 1  on the line A-A of that Figure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>         </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0017]    The drawings illustrate a hand tool, in particular, a podiatrists&#39; <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">nipper  11</span> , comp<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">rising hinged nipping or cutting blades  12</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">handles  13</span>  that are squeezed to effect the cutting or nipping action. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">handles  13</span>  are profiled in cross section to accept and retain a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">slide-on cushion  14</span> , of which only one is shown, the other being a mirror image. Of course, both cushions could be the same, simplifying production.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0018]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">handles  13</span>  are bifurcated and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">cushion  14</span>  has an â€˜Hâ€™ shaped cross section as seen in  FIG. 2 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">cushion  14</span>  has an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">end-stop  15</span>  that abuts the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">handle  13</span>  remote from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">blades  12</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">handles  13</span>  are recessed at  13   a  from the hinge end by the thickness of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">cushion  14</span>  to give a smooth transition at the hinge end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">cushion  14</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">tool  11</span>  has an internal spring, not shown. This adapts the implement better to cleaning and sterilising, as there is essentially no trap for foreign matter.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">blade  12</span>  are razor sharp, and have a flat cut, which is to say that they come together along their entire edged when closed, rather than just meeting at their ends. Razor sharpness is a feature particularly appropriate to disposable, single use, or at least limited use nail nippers, and further reduces the incidence of RSI as less force is required to cut through a nail than with multiple use nippers, which are manufactured less than razor sharp in order that they maintain a constant sharpness throughout their life. Razor sharp nippers dull quickly, but this is, of course, of no consequence in a disposable implement.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]    The cushions are made of an autoclavable polymer such as ethylene-vinyl acetate. </p>
