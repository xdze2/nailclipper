                        <p>   SPECIFICATION forming part-of Letters Patent N 0. 504,601, dated September 5 1893.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Application filed March 11, 1893. Serial No. 465,542. (No model.)   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern.-   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, EDMUND T. Mason, of New York city, in the county and State of New York, have invented a new and 1m.- proved Finger or Toe Nail Cutter, of which the following is a full, clear, and exact description.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My invention relates to an improvement in finger or toe-nail cutters, and has for its ob ject to provide a device which shall be simple, durable and economic, and by means of which a nail may not only be out but shaped while particles are being removed from it.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object of the invention is to provide a manicure device especially adapted for cutting nails, which will be compact and simple in its construction, and capable of being readily manipulated by onevhand, the device being made of such shape and capable of being so folded that it may be readily carried in the pocket or suspended from the watchchain, for example.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The invention consists in the, novel construction and combination of the several parts, as will be hereinafter fully set forth and pointed out in the claim.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Reference is to be had to the accompanying drawings forming a part of this specification, in which similar figures and letters of reference indicate corresponding parts in all-the views.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 1 is a perspective view of the cutter, illustrating it in its open position. Fig. 2 is a central, vertical, longitudinal section through the cutter whenin its closed position. Fig. 3 is a side elevation of the cutter in its open position. Fig. 4. is a plan view thereof in its closed position; and Fig. 5 is a view of the cutting end of the cutter.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In carrying out the invention the body A of the device is somewhat of a viselike structure,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> compri<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">sing two members 10 and 11</span></span>, preferably of the same general contour, which members are ordinarily made narrow near their central portions and at one end, the other end of each member being made quite wide, the wide portion forming the jaw, and the jaw of one member is designated as 10 while the jaw of the other member is designated as 11. The jaws are carried somewhat horizontally from the body in an inwardly direction, and the longitudinal edges of the jaws are sharpened so as to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> pro duoe cutting edges 12</span>, while the longitudinal outer faces of the jaws at the cutting edges are decidedly concaved as illustrated at 13 in Fig. 4. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> member<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">s 10, 11</span></span> are formed from a single plate of sheet metal bent into V or U shape so that when the free diverging ends of the members are pressed together the cutting edges will abut and when pressure is removed they will spring apart. The plate is slotted at its bend as shown at 14, and there provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> transverse pivot 13</span> 011 which is hung the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> hook latch 15</span>. The heel of the latch is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> shoulder 15</span> which engages the free end of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> plate spring 16</span> so as to be thrown outwardly thereby. The opposite end of the spring is secured&#39;to the inner face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> member 11</span>. The outer end of the member is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> yoke 18</span> between the side arms of which the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> member 10</span> is adapted to move freely. The yokecarries a pintle or pivot18 on which the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> cam lever 19</span> is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> pivoted asat 19</span> to engage the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> member 10</span> with its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> cam portion 20</span> and force the cutters together in the usual way. The under surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> lever 19</span> has a file surface and its free end is provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> notches 23</span> for the point of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> hook latch 19</span> to enter when the parts are in their closed position, see Fig. 2.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   When the device is to be used pressure is applied to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> lever 19</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring 16</span> will throw the latch out of engagement with it.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  This spring retracted latch is a great improvement over a latch which has no spring and must be drawn away from the lever by hand or allowed to fall by gravity as in the latter instance rust or dirt would prevent such action.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   24: is a suspension ring secured to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> latch 15</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having thus described my invention, I claim as new and desire to secure by Letters Patent- A finger nail cutter consisting in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> integr<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">al diverging members 10, 11</span></span> provided at I I their free ends with cutters and formed of a to be engaged by, said latch, substantially as single piece slotted at its bend, the hook set iotth.w latch pivoted in the slot and provied at its heel with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> shoulder 14</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> spring 16</span> bearing- 5 on the said shoulder and throwing the latch Witnesses:   </p>
