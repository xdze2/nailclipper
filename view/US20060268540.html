                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A lighting device for use in combination with a nail clipper and cutting pliers is disclosed. The lighting device comprises a casing defining an angular front wall having an electric power source, a switch and a light-emitting element all integrally assembled and electrically connected within the casing. A radiation surface is mounted within the angular front wall for transmitting illumination light emitted from the light-emitting element wherein means for removably attaching the casing to either the nail clipper or cutting pliers are provided whereby the angle defined by the front wall positions the illumination light emitted from the light-emitting element for illuminating a blood vein or nerve through the animals nail such that the user does not strike or nick the blood vein or nerve during a cutting operation. </p>

                        <p>        [0001]     1. Field of the Invention   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0002]     The present invention relates to a lighting device attachment to a cutter useful as a nail clipper for trimming nails of an animal, such as a dog or cat. More particularly, it relates to a lighting device configured for use in combination with a nail clipper that provides a light source to illuminate the blood vein of the animal&#39;s nail providing a visual means for cutting the nail at a length that avoids nicking the blood vein which may result in bleeding and/or injury to the animal.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]     2. Description of the Related Art   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]     Most animals dislike having their nails clipped. Many dogs object to nail cutting because someone has clipped their nails too short in the past and hurt them. Unlike human toenails, dogs&#39; toenails have a nerve and a blood vein inside them. Often-times the animals squirm and move around making it difficult to clip off the desired amount. When cut too short, it causes pain and bleeding thus injuring the animal.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]     Therefore, it is desirable to have a tool or tools to easily and safely trim constantly elongating nails on animals that require such trimming without cutting into the blood vein or nerve. The tool of choice in most cases is the conventional nail clipper which conventionally features two opposing blades biased away from each other and which communicate when the bias is overcome by activation of a lever attached thereto. The blade surfaces meet and cut the nail which is first inserted in between the two blades.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]     Currently, conventionally used nail clippers depend upon the natural vision of the user to see the nail which is intended for cutting, and place it properly in the very small area in between the two opposing cutting blades of the clipper. Placing the nail too far into the blades will cause too much to be removed resulting in injury. Conversely, placing too little of the nail to be cut into the clipper causes too little to be cut away requiring a second and more detailed cut placing the blades closer to the blood vein or nerve creating a greater risk of injury to the animal.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]     As is obvious, it is imperative for the user to be able to see the nail and surrounding surface clearly, to determine the amount to be cut from the nail and to determine what areas not to cut which would result in injury. It is equally imperative for the clipper user to be able to clearly view the blood vein and nerve within the nail when inserted into the nail clipper to determine that the proper amount is placed into the jaws of the clipper. Currently, the user must depend on his good vision and ability to focus on the nail and work area of the clipper to reach the proper conclusion on cutting.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]     However, current nail clipping devices only provide a cutting area activated by a lever wherein the user must attempt to see what is being cut unaided. As such, there exists a need for an easily and inexpensively manufactured lighting device that is attachable during manufacture of nail clippers, or with an attachment means allowing the lighting device to be attached to conventionally used and owned nail clippers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0009]     A lighting device for use in combination with a nail clipper and cutting pliers is disclosed. The lighting device comprises a casing defining an angular front wall having an electric power source, a switch and a light-emitting element all integrally assembled and electrically connected within the casing. A radiation surface is mounted within the angular front wall for transmitting illumination light emitted from the light-emitting element wherein means for removably attaching the casing to either the nail clipper or cutting pliers are provided whereby the angle defined by the front wall positions the illumination light emitted from the light-emitting element to illuminate a blood vein or nerve through the animals nail such that the user does not strike or nick the blood vein or nerve during a cutting operation.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0020]      FIG. 1  provides a perspective view of a conventional nail clipper. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">conventional nail clipper  20</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">stationary handle member  22</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">pivoting handle member  24</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutting blade  30</span>  connected to be actuated by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">pivoting handle member  24</span> . In effect, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutting blade  30</span>  is similar to that of a guillotine. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">cover or top wall  32</span>  secures a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">nail holder  18</span>  to the lower front portion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">stationary handle member  22</span>  by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">screws  28</span> . As shown in  FIG. 1 , the forward portion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">stationary handle member  22</span>  has top and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">bottom walls  32</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">two opposite side walls  36</span>  which form a generally rectangular passage in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">which nail holder  18</span>  is stationarily mounted along with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">cutting blade  30</span>  which is slidably received in generally overlapped relation with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">nail holder  18</span>  to slide against the inside surfaces of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">walls  32</span>  and  36 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]     Referring now to  FIGS. 2 and 3  there are shown perspective views of a lighting device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.  FIG. 2  shows an example of a structure of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">semiconductor lighting device  40</span>  having an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">electric power source  52</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">switch  50</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light-emitting element  48</span>  such as a light-emitting diode all integrally assembled within a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">casing  42</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">radiation surface  58</span>  transmits the illumination light emitted from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light-emitting element  48</span>  incorporated in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">lighting device  58</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">radiation surface  58</span>  is formed of a transparent resin material or the like. It is effective to perform surface processing on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">radiation surface  58</span>  to obtain directed or focused light. It is also effective to provide a lens. Although  FIG. 2  shows the case where the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">radiation surface  58</span>  is formed on the surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">casing  42</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">lighting device  58</span> , it is a matter of course that the lighting device may have such a form that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">radiation surface  58</span>  projects from the surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">casing  42</span> . In view of reliability and life, it is practical to use a light emitting diode (LED) as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light-emitting element  48</span> . Although the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">switch  50</span>  may be of the momentary contact type or of the bistable type, the latter is more convenient in view of its operating property.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]     Turning once again to  FIGS. 2 and 3  the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">semiconductor lighting device  40</span>  is removably attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">stationary handle member  22</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">conventional nail clipper  20</span>  by utilizing the same threaded <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">inserts (not shown) provided for screws  28</span> . More specifically, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">casing  42</span>  defines an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">aperture channel  46</span>  sufficiently sized to allow the lower front portion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">stationary handle member  22</span>  to slidably engage into when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">screws  28</span>  are removed. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">aperture channel  46</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">casing  42</span>  defines eit<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">her two threaded inserts or screw holes  44</span>  through a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">top wall  60</span>  which are located to align with the threaded inserts used by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">screws  28</span>  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">casing  42</span>  is fully inserted onto the lower front portion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">stationary handle member  22</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">Slightly longer screws  29</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">washers  56</span>  are then used in lieu of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">screws  28</span>  for securely attaching the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">casing  42</span>  to the lower front portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">stationary handle member  22</span> , as shown in  FIG. 3 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]     Referring to  FIG. 2 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light emitting element  48</span>  is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">mounted within casing  40</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">radiation surface  58</span>  pointing at an angle defined by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">front wall  62</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">casing  40</span> . When in use the angle defined by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">front wall  62</span>  positions the illumination light emitted from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light-emitting element  48</span>  to illuminate the blood vein or nerve through the animals nail (not shown) as will be more fully described below. It should be appreciated that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light-emitting element  48</span>  is chosen of sufficient intensity and frequency to allow the user to visually detect the blood vein and/or nerve when the illumination light directly hits and passes through the nail. In operation, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">nail clipper  20</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">generally tear drop shaped aperture  26</span>  there through in the portion thereof protruding outwardly beyond <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">cover  32</span>  to receive and position an animal nail by using the illumination light to position the nail portion to be cut such that it does not strike or nick the blood vein or nerve. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">user then engages switch  50</span>  thereby turning on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light emitting element  48</span> . Once the animal nail to be cut is positioned by the user using the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light emitting element  48</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">blade  <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">30</span>  passes across opening  26</span>  when the clipper is manually actuated by squeezing of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">handle <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> 24</span>  toward handle  22</span>  against the bias of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">tension coil spring  30</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]     Referring to  FIG. 3 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">semiconductor lighting device  40</span>  defines a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">removable back wall  54</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">casing  40</span>  for removal and replacement of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">electric power source  52</span> . By way of example and not of limitation, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">electric power source  52</span>  may be a lithium ion button battery. Additionally, it should be understood that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">electric power source  52</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">switch  50</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light-emitting element  48</span>  are all electrically connected to each other as is commonly known in the electrical arts. Lastly, after cutting the animal&#39;s nail or nails the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">user once again engages switch  50</span>  thereby turning off the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light emitting element  48</span>  which in turn saves battery power.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]      FIG. 4  is a perspective view of another conventional nail clipper in the form of cutting pliers. As shown in  FIG. 4 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">cutting pliers  62</span>  are defined by two levers,  64  and  66  articulated to each other on an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">axis  72</span>  and kept spread apart by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">spring  68</span> , characterized in that one of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">levers  64</span>  defines a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">blade  78</span>  on which the blade is fixed in a movable manner by use of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">screw  70</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">nut  76</span>  combination.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]      FIG. 5  shows an exploded perspective view of another <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">lighting device  40</span>   a  in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. The structure of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">semiconductor lighting device  40</span>   a  has the electric power source and switch (not shown), and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light-emitting element  48</span>  all integrally assembled within a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">slightly different casing  42</span>   a  from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">previously described casing  42</span> . The difference in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">casing  42</span>   a  is that it is more elongated and defines a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">single through-hole  44</span>   a  along a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">top wall  60</span>   a  for receiving the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">existing screw  70</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">nut  76</span>  used with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem63">cutting pliers  63</span>  shown in  FIG. 4 . It should be understood that all other electrical and optical features of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">semiconductor lighting device  40</span>   a  are the same as previously desc<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">ribed for semiconductor lighting device  40</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]     Turning to  FIG. 6 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">semiconductor lighting device  40</span>   a  is removably attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">cutting pliers  62</span>  by utilizing the s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">ame hole (not shown) provided for screw  70</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">nut  76</span>  using the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">through-hole  44</span>   a  defined by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">casing  42</span>   a.  Before the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">screw  70</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">nut  76</span>  are tightened, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light emitting element  48</span>  is adjusted to shine through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">space  74</span>  defined by the cutting ends of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">levers  64</span>  and  66 . The cutting operation is essentially as described before with the user utilizing the illumination light to detect the blood vein or nerve of the animal thereby locating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">blade  78</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">cutting pliers  62</span>  to miss the blood vein and/or nerve when the levers are pulled together to cut the animal&#39;s nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]      FIG. 7  is a perspective view of a nail clipper with lighting device in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. As shown in  FIG. 7  the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">lighting device  80</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82">stationary handle member  82</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">pivoting handle member  84</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem86">cutting blade  86</span>  connected to be actuated by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">pivoting handle member  84</span> . Once again, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">cutting blade  84</span>  is similar to that of a guillotine. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem88">lower front portion  88</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82">stationary handle member  82</span>  houses the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">switch  50</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light-emitting element  48</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem88">upper front portion  88</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82">stationary handle member  82</span>  provides a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem85">generally rectangular passage  85</span>  in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem86">which cutting blade  86</span>  may be slidably received in and out during a cutting operation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0029]     Referring now to  FIG. 9  there is shown a perspective view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem88">lower front portion  88</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">nail clipper  80</span>  wherein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">electric power source  52</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">switch  50</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light-emitting diode  48</span>  are all integrally assembled within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem88">lower front portion  88</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem96">central portion  96</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82">stationary handle member  82</span>  defines a compartment for housing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">battery  50</span> . As described above, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">radiation surface  58</span>  transmits the illumination light emitted from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light-emitting element  48</span>  incorporated within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem88">lower front portion  88</span> . Additionally, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem86">blade unit  86</span>  slides out of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem85">compartment  85</span>  for easy blade replacement, as shown in  FIG. 10 . Turning once again to  FIG. 9 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem88">lower front portion  88</span>  is removably detached from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">stationary handle member  22</span>  by use of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90">press release lever  90</span>  located along the side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem88">lower front portion  88</span>  for bulb, LED or battery replacement.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0030]     Referring to  FIG. 10 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light emitting element  48</span>  is mounted with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">radiation surface  58</span>  pointing at an angle defined by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem94">front wall  94</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem88">lower front portion  88</span> . When in use the angle defined by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem94">front wall  94</span>  positions the illumination light emitted from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light-emitting element  48</span>  to illuminate the blood vein or nerve through the animals nail (not shown). Once again, in operation, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">nail clipper  80</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem98">generally tear drop shaped ap<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem86">erture  98</span>  defined within blade  86</span>  to receive and position an animal nail. By using the illumination light to position the nail portion to be cut, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">user engages switch  50</span>  thereby turning on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light emitting element  48</span> . Once the animal nail to be cut is positioned by the user using the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">light emitting element  48</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem86">blade  86</span>  <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem85">withdraws into rectangular compartment  85</span>  when the clipper is manually actuated by squeezing of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">handle <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82"> 84</span>  toward handle  82</span> . The nail is thereafter cut avoiding the nicking or slicing of the blood vein or nerve of the animal.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0031]     As is disclosed herein, a lighting device for use in combination with a nail clipper provides the user with the capability to enhance the user&#39;s natural ability to see both the nail to be clipped, the location of the blood vein and nerve, and, the working area of the clipper blades which are in the field of view of the user during use of the clipper. By enhancing the view of the blood vein and nerve in the nail as well as the work area of the clipper, the user is provided a major improvement in both safety and utility when using a nail clipper.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0032]     The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims, rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope. </p>
