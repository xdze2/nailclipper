                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> By providing separate, easily mountable members which incorporate finger/thumb receiving and holding zones constructed for use and access by individuals with reduced or impaired manual dexterity, a control improving and enhancing system is achieved which is mountable directly to conventional implements, such as manicure implements. Preferably, each control improving and enhancing system is constructed for being quickly and easily securely mounted to existing implements and may be removable therefrom for use on other implements. In addition, each control improving and enhancing system is constructed with enlarged, specially constructed, readily accessible, easily employable finger/thumb receiving and supporting zones which are positioned to assure complete operational control of the implement, thereby enabling individuals with reduced or impaired manual dexterity, or with varying stages of joint diseases, such as arthritis, to naturally and confidently use the implements. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/413,224, filed Sept. 27, 1989, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,052,416.  </p>

                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      TECHNICAL FIELD  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This invention relates to manicure implements and more particularly to components mountable to conventional manicure implements for improving the ease with which the implement may be handled and controlled during use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      BACKGROUND ART  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Manicure implements such as fingernail clippers, toenail clippers, tweezers and emery boards are extremely popular and widely used to improve one&#39;s hygiene and visual appearance. However, many individuals who have been using such manicure implements for many years find it increasingly difficult to manipulate these small devices, particularly as these individuals age or lose manual dexterity.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In addition, many individuals suffer from arthritis or other forms of joint disease, which makes it extremely difficult to hold and use small implements. Although these individuals find it difficult to hold and employ these manicure devices, these individuals desire to use these devices and attempt to do so, with varying degrees of success.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In view of this problem, the manicure implements have been constructed in a variety of alternate configurations in an attempt to improve the handling characteristics of these implements. However, either due to manufacturing difficulties or construction expenses, these prior art systems have been incapable of satisfying consumers&#39; desire to have manicure implements which are easily handled, regardless of impaired dexterity.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      One of the principal drawbacks encountered with prior art constructions is the inability to develop a usable product which is not too costly to produce. Typically, the prior art configurations that have been developed suffer from the inability to be competitively manufactured. Consequently, these implements cannot be sold at a reasonable price. Furthermore, many of these prior art constructions fail to enhance the operability of the manicure implements and, instead, merely create a more cumbersome, difficult-to-use product.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Consequently, it is a principal object of the present invention to provide manicure implements which are easily employed by all individuals, regardless of the level of dexterity the individuals may have and, more particularly, easy to use by individuals with reduced manual dexterity.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Another object of the present invention is to provide manicure implements having the characteristic features described above which are comparatively simple in construction and manufacture.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Another object of the present invention is to provide manicure implements having the characteristic features described above which can be sold at a competitive price with the enhanced handling characteristics included therewith.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Another object of the present invention is to provide manicure implements having the characteristic features described above which are comfortable to hold and use by all individuals, particularly individuals having very limited finger manipulation capabilities.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Other and more specific objects will in part be obvious and will in part appear hereinafter.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      By employing the teaching of the present invention, the drawbacks, difficulties and failings found in the prior art have been eliminated. In particular, it has been found that by constructing control enhancing systems or components which are quickly and easily mounted to existing manicure implements, the control and handling capabilities of the implements are substantially improved, enabling all individuals to securely, comfortably and naturally hold and employ implements which some individuals were previously unable to use. Furthermore, by using the present invention, the implements are imparted with enhanced handling capabilities without affecting the production of the implements themselves. Consequently, manicure implements for which control improvement and enhancement is desired are manufactured by conventional techniques and are improved by subsequently mounting the control enhancing systems of the present invention directly to the conventional manicure implements.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      If desired, the control enhancing system of the present invention can be either securely affixed to conventional manicure implements or constructed for being removably mounted to conventional manicure implements. Regardless of whether removability or secure affixation is preferred, the control enhancing system of the present invention is constructed in substantially the same way for being quickly and easily securely mounted to the particular manicure implement. In this way, uniform construction techniques are attained and manufacturing costs are reduced.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In the present invention, the control enhancing system is constructed for being rapidly securable to a particular manicure implement in a manner which requires no sophisticated tools or equipment. As a result, by constructing the control enhancing systems of the present invention in a manner which allows rapid, easy mountability of the system to the particular manicure implement, the use of the control enhancing system can be quickly and easily attained by the individual as well as the manufacturer.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In addition to direct, easy mountability to existing manicure implements, each of the control enhancing systems of the present invention is constructed to provide all individuals with substantially improved control of the manicure implement. In particular, individuals having reduced or impaired manual dexterity are now able to use implements which were previously difficult or impossible to use. However, the control enhancing systems of the present invention are specifically constructed to enable all individuals, with various degrees of manual dexterity or varying stages of joint diseases, such as arthritis, to easily hold and use the manicure implements with complete control and confidence.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In order to provide enhanced control and improved use and implementation of the manicure devices, each control enhancing system of the present invention incorporates finger or thumb engaging zones specifically constructed for receiving thumbs, fingers, or hand or palm portions of the individual in a comfortable, natural manner, which allows the individual to employ the manicure implement with ease and convenience.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As will be readily understood by one of ordinary skill in this art, the control enhancing system of the present invention is usable on all manicure implements, as well as on all other similar hand manipulated devices, with which individuals with reduced or impaired manual dexterity traditionally experience difficulties. However, for the purpose of the present disclosure and, without in any way intending to be limited to the specific disclosure, the following drawings and detailed disclosure exemplify the use of the present invention in connection with toenail and fingernail clippers, tweezers and emery boards. However, the present invention is considered to extend beyond these specific embodiments and no intent to limit the present invention to these specific embodiments is contemplated.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In the following drawings, specific configurations of the control-improving systems and components of the present invention for manicure implements are specifically detailed and disclosed. As will be apparent from this disclosure, the teaching of the present invention can be employed in numerous other manicure implements or manually controlled products by creating similar control-improving systems therefor. Consequently, although control improving systems for nail clippers, tweezers and emery boards are specifically detailed herein, the present invention is not intended to be limited to these manicure implements only, and any other manicure implement or similar product to which a control-improving system is mounted employing the teaching of this invention is intended to be within the scope of the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In FIG. 1,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> control-improving system 19</span> of the present invention is shown mounted to a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> typical nail clipper 23</span>. In this embodiment,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> control-improving system 19</span> comprises two independent components, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> lever-engaging member 20</span>, and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> base-engaging member 21</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In FIG. 1,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail clipper 23</span> is shown in its closed position, while FIG.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> 7 depicts nail clipper 23</span> in its open, ready-to-use, position. Furthermore,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail clipper 23</span> is depicted as a toenail clipper. However, the following disclosure applies with equal force and efficacy to fingernail clippers, as well as all clippers of similar construction.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Lever-engaging member 20</span> is mounted to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail cli<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">pper 23</span> while base-engaging member 2</span> is mounted to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> base 25</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail clipper 23</span>. By<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> mounting control improving system 19</span> to any typical nail clipper, the resulting nail clipper is easily used by individuals with impaired dexterity,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> since <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">members 20 and 21</span></span> enable the user to easily grip, hold, handle and manipulate the nail clipper, even though conventional nail clippers may not be used by the individual effectively.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As is more fully detailed below,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> member<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">s 20 and 21</span></span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> control-improving system 19</span> incorporate readily accessible finger or thumb receiving zones constructed to provide natural, comfortable, readily accessible holding zones enabling the user to quickly and easily securely grip and firmly hold the control improving members and employ the nail clippers in a natural, comfortable manner. However, before detailing the finger-receiving and engaging zones of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> member<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">s 20 and 21</span></span>, the construction and mounting of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> contro<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">l improving members 20 and 21</span></span> to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail clipper 23</span> will be described.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In FIGS. 2-5, the construction of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> lever-engaging member 20</span> for mounting to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> clipper 23</span> is shown in detail. By referring to these Figures and the following detailed discussion, the construction of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> lever-engaging member 20</span> can best be understood.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In its preferred embodiment,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> lever-engaging member 20</span> comprises a single component having a generally rectangular shape and incorporating a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> distal end 28</span>, and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> base 34</span> having an outer surface comprising a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> finger or thumb receiving zone 26</span> formed thereon. Preferably,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> finger/thumb receiving zone 26</span> comprises a substantially smooth surface formed by a substa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">ntially flat thumb/finger support surface 27</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> thumb/finger abutment surface 29</span>, and concave, intermediate,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> interconnecting surface 30</span>. As best seen in FIGS. 3 and 4,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> surfac<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">es 27, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">29 and 30</span></span></span> preferably comprise a smooth, substantially continuous blended construction thereby forming a comfortable thumb/finger receiving and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> holding zone 26</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As shown in FIG. 5,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> finger/thumb receiving zone 26</span> extends the entire width of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> lever-engaging member 20</span>, providing a wide, comfortable thumb receiving surface on which the user easily and conveniently positions either his thumb or finger. In addition to providing a readily accessible support surface,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> receiving zone 26</span> also provides positive assurance that unwanted forward movement of the thumb or finger is prevented. This is provided by the secure, contacting engagement of the thumb or finger with upstanding,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> convexly curved surface 29</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In order to assure that<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> lever-engaging member 20</span> is quickly and easily securely mountable to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail clipper 23</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> lever-engaging member 20<<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">/span> <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">incorporates upstanding side walls 31 and 32</span></span> and an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> upstanding distal end wall 33</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> Walls <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">31, 32 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">and 33</span></span></span> are all blended together to form a substantially continuous upstanding wall configuration. Furthermore,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> walls <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">31, 32 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">and 33</span></span></span> all extend from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> inside base 34</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> lever-engaging member 20</span> to provide a position holding and s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">ecuring surface for lever-engaging member 20</span> when<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> member 20</span> is mounted to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail clipper 23</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In the preferred embodiment,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> walls <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">31 and 32</span></span> are spaced apart a distance substantially equal to the width of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail clipper 23</span> with a tapered configuration conforming to the configuration of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span>. In addition,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> wall 33</span> extends between and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> interc<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">onnects walls 31 and 32</span></span> with an overall shape conforming to the terminating end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span>. In this way,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> walls <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">31, 32 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">and 33</span></span></span> cooperate to peripherally surround and abuttingly engage the terminating edge of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> allowing lever-engaging member 20</span> to be securely affixed to the end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span> with any side-to-side or forward movement being eliminated thereby.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Finally, in order to secure<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">ly lockingly engage lever-engaging member 20</span> to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span>, the proximal end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> memb<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">er 20</<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">span> incorporates locking flanges 38 and 39</span></span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> Locking flange 38</span> extends from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> upstanding side wall 31</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39"> while locking flange 39</span> extends from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> side wall 32</span>. In addition,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> flange<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">s 38 and 39</span></span> are spaced above the inside surface of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> base 34</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> lever-engaging member 20</span> a distance substantially equal to the thickness of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail clipper 23</span>. In this way, when<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> lever-engaging member 20</span> is mounted to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail clipper 23</span>, with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> walls <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">31, 32 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">and 33</span></span></span> peripherally surrounding and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> positioning lever-engaging member 20</span> to the distal end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> lockin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">g flanges 38 and 39</span></span>, in conjunction with the wall portions thereof, peripherally surround the sides of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lockingly engage lever arm 24</span>. In this way,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> lever-engaging member 20</span> is securely affixed in the precisely desired position to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As is apparent from the preceding disclosure,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> lever-engaging member 20</span> can be quickly and easily removed from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span> with the same speed and ease as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> required for mounting member 20</span> to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span>. In order to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> dislodge or remove member 20</span> from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> lockin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">g flanges 38 and 39</span></span> can be bent outwardly, thereby disengaging the locked position and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> allowing member 20</span> to be removed from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span>; whenever such removal is desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In an alternate embodiment,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> lever-engaging member 20</span> is securely affixed permanently to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span>. In this embodiment,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> member 20</span> is mounted to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span> in the manner described above. Then, if secure mounted engagement of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> member 20</span> is desired, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> locking pin 40</span>, as shown in FIG. 6, is employed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Typically,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span> incorporates a through hole formed in its distal end. As a result,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> member 20</span> preferably incorporates a through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> hole 41</span> positioned for juxtaposed axial alignment with the through hole of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> Once lever-engaging member 20</span> is mounted in position,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> hole 41</span> is axially aligned with the hole of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span>. Then, to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> securely affix member 20</span> to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> arm 24</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> locking pin 40</span> is inserted through the axially aligned holes and then affixed in this position, in the conventional manner,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> securing member 20</span> to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> lever arm 24</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 7,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> base-engaging member 21</span> is mounted directly to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> base 25</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail clipper 23</span> in order to impart the desired improved control and handling characteristics to the base of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail clipper 23</span>. In addition, in the preferred embodiment,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> base-engaging member 21</span> is constructed to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> completely enclose base 25</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail clipper 23</span>, thereby serving as a catcher for nail clippings in addition to providing improved control and handling characteristics to the nail clipper. If desired, however, the nail clipping catcher portion can be eliminated and only the control improving portion of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> member 21</span> may be employed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As best seen in FIGS. 7-12,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> base-engaging member 21</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> control improving system 19</span> of the present invention comprises a substantially elongated rectangular shape having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45"> base 45</span> with upstanding,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> elonga<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">ted side wall portions 46 and 47</span></span>, and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> upstanding wall portion 48</span> forming its terminating distal end.

In addition, double curved,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> S-shaped surface 54</span> commences at the distal end with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> upstanding wall 48</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45"> terminates inwardly therefrom along base 45</span><span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55"> with upstanding extension stop abutment 55</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      By employing this configuration, it has been found that<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> double curved surface 54</span>, in conjunction with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55"> stop abutment 55</span>, provides a readily accessible,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> convenient holding zone 56</span> for receiving the particular desired portion of one&#39;s hand to be used to operate the nail clipper. Typically, one or more of the user&#39;s fingers would <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">be nested directly adjacent stop abutment 55</span> within one of the curves of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> double curve surface 54</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Some individuals employ their fingers, thumb or portions of their hand or palm to control and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> operate nail clipper 23</span>. However, regardless of which portion of the hand is employed in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> using nail clipper 23</span>, it has been found that<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> &#34;S&#34;-shaped double curved surface 54</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55"> stop abutment 55</span> provide all individuals with a secure, convenient, readily accessible zone by which any individual having limited manual dexterity can quickly and easily hold and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> control base 25</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail clipper 23</span> in order to achieve the desired nail clipping operation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In the preferred embodiment,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> curved surface 54</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55"> enlarged stop abutment 55</span> comprise smooth, substantially continuous rounded surfaces to provide comfort and convenience to the user. If desired, other shapes or surface configurations could be employed, without departing from the scope of the invention. However, it has been found that a smooth, curved configuration as provided by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> zone 56</span> provides the optimum comfort and convenience to the user, while providing the desired control and handling characteristics to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail clipper 23</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">  </p>

In addition,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59"> upstanding post 59</span> also incorporates a pin receiving cavity<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> formed therein for receiving locking pin 60</span>, if secure affixation of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> control improving member 21</span> to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail clipper 23</span> is desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As is apparent from the foregoing detailed disclosure,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> lever-engaging member 20</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> base-engaging member 21</span> are quickly and easily either removably mounted to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail clipper 23</span> or permanently affixed to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail clipper 23</span> in order to substantially enhance and improve the control and handling characteristics of conventional nail clippers. By<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> mounting control improving system 19</span> to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> nail clipper 23</span>, a conventional nail clipper, whether it be a toenail clipper or a fingernail clipper is immediately converted into a manicure implement which can be easily held and operated with convenience and ease by individuals having complete manual dexterity as well as by individuals having limited manual dexterity. As a result, such manicure implements as toenail clippers and fingernail clippers, which previously have been unusable by older individuals or individuals with varying stages of arthritis or other joint diseases, can now be used by these individuals with the knowledge and assurance that they can easily operate and completely control the nail clippers. In this way, use of nail clippers, which has previously been denied such individuals, can now be fully and completely employed by them with confidence and ease.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Another manicure implement which individuals having reduced manual dexterity desire to employ is tweezers. However, due to the small elongated arm members forming most conventional tweezers, these individuals have experienced substantial difficulty in holding and controlling the use of conventional tweezers. In particular, these tweezers tend to roll or twist in the user&#39;s hand, thereby rendering the tweezers useless, since the operating jaws cannot be opened and closed at precisely desired locations.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In order to eliminate this difficulty and attain a tweezers construction which can be employed by individuals With limited or reduced manual dexterity,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> control improving assembly 70</span> was developed. As shown in FIG. 13,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> control improving assembly 70</span> is mountable to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71"> conventional tweezers 71</span> and comprises substantially simil<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">ar elon<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73">gated tweezer-arm engaging members 72 and 73</span></span>, each of which is mounted to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75"> one elongated arm 75</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71"> tweezers 71</span>. By referring to FIGS. 13-20 along with the following detailed disclosure, the precise construction and operation of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> control improving assembly 70</span> can best be understood.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As is more fully detailed below,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> tweeze<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73">r-arm engaging members 72 and 73</span></span> are substantially identical in construction, except for the interlocking system formed at the distal end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> member<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73">s 72 and 73</span></span>. Consequently, except for specific detailed discussions concerning this interlocking construction, all references to the construction of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> either<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73"> tweezer-arm engaging member 72 or 73</span></span> is intended to apply equally to both components.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In addition, in FIGS. 14-19,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73"> tweezer-arm engaging component 73</span> has been depicted and is employed in the following detailed discussion. However, all references to the construction and operation of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73"> tweezer-arm engaging component 73</span> in the following detailed discussion, except where noted, is intended to apply with equal force and effect as a detailed discussion of the construction of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> tweezer-arm engaging member 72</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As shown in FIGS. 14-19,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73"> tweezer-arm engaging member 73</span> comprises a substantially elongated generally rectangular shape defined by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> base 76</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem77"> upstanding wall 77<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"></span> which peripherally surrounds base 76</span> and forms the terminating edges of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73"> tweezer-arm engaging member 73</span> on three of its four sides. As clearly shown in FIG. 14, upstanding,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem77"> peripherally surrounding wall 77</span> comprises an irr<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">egularly shaped continuous inside surface 78</span>, which is constructed to conform precisely with the shape of the outside edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75"> tweezer arm 75</span> to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73"> which tweezer-arm engaging member 73</span> is to be mounted. In this way,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75"> one arm 75</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71"> tweezers 71</sp<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem77">an> nests directly within upstanding wall 77</span> with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78"> surf<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75">ace 78</span> surroundingly embracing arm 75</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71"> tweezers 71</span> to assure secure, slip-free attachment thereto.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In addition, in order to assure secure mounted locking engagement of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73"> tweezer-arm engaging member 73</span> to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75"> arm 75</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71"> tweezers 71</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73"> tweezer-arm engaging member 73</span> incorporates a plurality of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80"> inwardly extending flanges 80</span> formed on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem77"> upstanding wall 77</span>. As best seen in FIGS. 17 and 19,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80"> inwardly extending flanges 80</span> are<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> spaced above base 76</span> a distance substantially equal to the thickness of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75"> arm 75</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71"> tweezers 71</span>. In this way,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73"> tweezer-arm engaging member 73</span> is quickly and easily securely fastened to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75"> arm 75</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71"> tweezers 71</span> by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75"> positioning arm 75</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71"> tweezers 71</span> in the accommodating recess formed by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem77"> peripherally surrounding wall 77</span>, with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80"> flanges 80</span> cooperating with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem77"> wall 77</span> to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75"> surround arm 75</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71"> tweezers 71</span> and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem73">securely lock tweezer-arm engaging member 73</span> to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75"> tweezers arm 75</span>.  </p>

In this way,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101"> emery board 101</span> is frictionally locked in engagement with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem98"> walls <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem99">98 and 99</span></span> when<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101"> board 101</span> is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem97"> inserted into slot 97</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      By employing this construction, the user is able to easily obtain a firm and secure grip on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem94"> control enhancing member 94</span> by merely placing a thumb on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem95"> either<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem96"> surface 95 or 96</span></span>, and then placing any desired finger on the remaining finger/thumb receiving surface. Then, by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem98"> merely<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem99"> holding wall portions 98 and 99</span></span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101"> emery <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem97">board 101</span> positioned within recess 97</span> is securely frictionally looked between<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem98"> walls <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem99">98 and 99</span></span>. In this way,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101"> the user easily manipulates emery board 101</span> in the desired manner, achieving the desired controlled use thereof.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As shown in FIGS. 23 and 24,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101"> emery board 101</span> is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem97"> positioned within recess 97</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem94"> control enhancing member 94</span> in order to allow the user to attain the desired controlled use of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101"> emery board 101</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem94"> Although control enhancing member 94</span> is shown positioned at the distal end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101"> emery board 101</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem94"> control enhancing member 94</span> can be positioned at any location along the length of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101"> emery board 101</span>, wherever most convenient for the user. In this way, complete control over any length of the emery board can be maintained as well as use of the entire emery board.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As best seen in FIG. 27, in order to provide the secure, locked engagement of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101"> emery board 101</span> with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem98"> walls <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem99">98 and 99</span></span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104"> emery board engaging surface 104</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem99"> side wall 99</span> is constructed to be substantially flat throughout its length and width. In this way, the surface area available to engage and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101"> hold emery board 101</span> is maximized. In addition, in order to assure operational ease in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101"> inserting emery board 101</span> in position, substantially flat,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104"> planar surface 104</span> is peripherally surrounded on its open sides by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105"> beveled edge 105</span>. As shown in FIG. 26,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem98"> wall portion 98</span> is also constructed in the identical manner as detailed above in reference to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem99"> wall 99</span> with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104"> planar surface 104</span> surrounded on three sides by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105"> beveled edge 105</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As a result of this construction, an enlarged entry-way is provided by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105"> facing<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105"> beveled portions 105, 105</span></span> providing a readily accessible zone for receiving the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101"> emery board 101</span>, whether the emery board is inserted in the side of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem94"> control enhancing member 94</span> or at the top thereof. In addition,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101"> once emery board 101</span> has<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem97"> been placed within slot 97</span> and in abutting engagement with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> bridge 100</span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101"> emery board 101</span> is in securely locked frictional engagement with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104"> engagi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">ng surfaces 104, 104</span></span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem98"> side w<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem99">alls 98 and 99</span></span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Although it has been found that<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem94"> control enhancing member 94</span> is preferably constructed in the manner detailed above, alternate co<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem94">nfigurations for control enhancing member 94</span> can be employed without departing from the scope of the present invention. In particular, one alternate configuration would be to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem98"> constr<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem99">uct either side wall 98 or 99</span></span> with a substantially greater side-to-side width, in order to allow two or three fingers of the user to be positioned on the face thereof, thereby also establishing a substantially greater emery board engaging surface. Although it has been found that the configuration shown in FIGS. 23-27 provides secure locking engagement of emery boards for use by the individual, this alternate configuration, or any other similar alternate construction, could be made, if so desired, without departing from the scope of this invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In addition to the specific control and improving configurations detailed herein for the specific manicure implements or products, a plurality of alternate control improving members can be created for other similar products using the teaching of the present invention. Consequently, it is intended that all control improving configurations which incorporate the teaching of this invention shall be considered to be within the scope of protection afforded by this disclosure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It will thus be seen that the objects set forth above, among those made apparent from the preceding description, are efficiently attained and, since certain changes may be made in the above constructions without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limited sense.  </p>
