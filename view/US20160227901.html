                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> [0001]    This application is related to pending patent application Ser. No. 11/226,811, entitled Nail Clipper, that was filed on Sep. 13, 2005.  </p>
                    
                        <p>       </p>
                    
                        <p>      </p>
                    
                        <p>      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    The present invention, in general, relates to personal grooming devices and, more particularly, to toe and finger nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    Nail clippers, the term herein including either toe or finger nail type of clippers, are generally well known.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    Nail clippers have certain problems. For example, prior art designs tend to spray the clippings into a room. The clippings may be sharp and can even spread infection. Therefore, it is desirable to contain clippings.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    However, prior art nail clippers include a center post that engages with a pivoting lever. The pivoting lever, pressing upon a ridge in the center post applies pressure to the clipper sufficient to urge a pair of opposite sides, and therefore also the blades, toward one-another during use.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    The center post, though necessary, provides an obstruction that certain of the clippings inevitably must impact. The clippings bounce off of the center post and are scattered. Any prior art type of modification intended to retain the clippings has proven to be ineffective when they are bouncing off of the center post.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    Other prior-art types of nail clippers do not fold sufficiently flat for storage. Others do not apply leverage that can create sufficient force to cut through difficult nails without requiring a great deal of force by the user.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    Additionally, prior art nail clippers include considerable metal that has been machined. This is considerably more expensive than plastic, for example. However, all prior art designs have heretofore included a fully functional metallic nail clipper, with perhaps plastic surround components as well. This has been expensive.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    There is a need to an inexpensive nail clipper. There is a need for a disposable nail clipper that is also inexpensive. Such a device could be given away at finer hotels or sold for minimum cost. It could also be a free item that included advertising, for example.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    Nail clippers are expensive because of the machining that is required to manufacture the metal portions thereof. The top and bottom blades must not only be cut to a fine edge, but they must align precisely. It is relatively inexpensive to make a blade, but the manufacture of two blades that mesh precisely together, is what drives up the cost of manufacture.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    Also, because nail clippers include so much metal, they are detected at airport security checks and often result in the searching of personal sundries that would not otherwise be so scrutinized. They may even be confiscated as a potentially dangerous weapon, which of course is a debatable assessment, but if confiscated it leaves the person without a nail clipper when they reach their destination. It is desirable to include so little metal with a nail clipper that it does not register as a potential threat during airport check-in procedures.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]    Accordingly, there exists today a need for a nail clipper with blade-insert that helps ameliorate the above-mentioned and other difficulties.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0014]    Clearly, such an apparatus would be a useful and desirable device.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0015]    2. Description of Prior Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0016]    Nail clippers are, in general, known. While the structural arrangements of the above described known types of devices may, at first appearance, have similarities with the present invention, they differ in material respects. These differences, which will be described in more detail hereinafter, are essential for the effective use of the invention and which admit of the advantages that are not available with the prior devices.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0017]    It is an object of the present invention to provide a nail clipper with blade-insert that is inexpensive to manufacture.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0018]    It is also an important object of the invention to provide a nail clipper with blade-insert that includes a replaceable cutting edge.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]    Another object of the invention is to provide a nail clipper with blade-insert that is primarily made of a plastic, nylon, or polymer.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0020]    Still another object of the invention is to provide a nail clipper with blade-insert that is aesthetically attractive.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0021]    Still yet another object of the invention is to provide a nail clipper with blade-insert that is sufficiently inexpensive to manufacture as to be disposable.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0022]    Yet another important object of the invention is to provide a nail clipper with blade-insert that includes a small cutting edge in a plastic frame.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]    Still yet another important object of the invention is to provide a nail clipper that includes a plastic frame that is attractive.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    A first continuing object of the invention is to provide a nail clipper with blade-insert that is available in a desired color.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]    A second continuing object of the invention is to provide a nail clipper with blade-insert that is lightweight.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]    A third continuing object of the invention is to provide a nail clipper with blade-insert that includes a blade that is formed of a metallic or other suitable material and a second blade that is formed of a metallic or other suitable material and wherein the blade and the second blade are not formed of a continuous piece of the material.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]    Briefly, a nail clipper with blade-insert that is constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention has a plastic frame with a pair of cutting blades that are attached to the plastic frame and face each other. According to a preferred embodiment the pair of cutting blades can be replaced with new blades. According to another preferred embodiment, the device is disposable. Various embodiments are shown which illustrate some of versatility and benefits that are possible.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0037]    Referring to all of the drawing figures and now primarily to  FIG. 1  is shown, a first disposable type of a nail clipper with blade-insert, identified in general by the reference numeral  10 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0038]    A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">one-piece plastic frame member  12</span>  is molded out of a sufficient grade of plastic, nylon, or other material other than a metal.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0039]    A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring  14</span>  is provided to push an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame member  12</span>  away from a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">bottom half  12</span>   b . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring  14</span>  fits into a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">hole  16</span>  provided in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">bottom half  12</span>   b  and a similar hole (not shown) that is provided in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">top half  12</span>   a.     </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0040]    If desired, a greater amount of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">plastic material  18</span>  (shown in dashed lines) is provided near a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">rear  20</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame member  12</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">plastic material  18</span>  is used instead of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring  14</span>  to urge the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">bottom half  12</span>   b  away from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  when no force is applied to any portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame member  12</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0041]    If desired, other types of springs (not shown) can be used.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0042]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame member  12</span>  of the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  includes a first enlarged front portion, identified in general by the reference numeral  22 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0043]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">first enlarged front portion  22</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">vertical section  24</span>  that is generally perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a . An <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">inside radius  26</span>  connects the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">vertical section  24</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  along an inside surface of the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> . An <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">outside radius  28</span>  similarly connects the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">vertical section  24</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  along an outside surface of the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0044]    A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">first recess  30</span>  is provided in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">bottom surface  32</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">vertical section  24</span>  that extends across the width thereof. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">first recess  30</span>  can be straight or it may include a curve, as desired.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0045]    A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  is inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">first recess  30</span>  and is held in place by friction or by any preferred method or combination of methods, as desired. For example, holes (not shown) can be provided through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span> . Plastic material from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">vertical section  24</span>  can extend through the holes sufficient to secure the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  precisely in position. If desired, an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">adhesive  35</span>  may be used.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0046]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  includes a small piece of planar material with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  that is disposed closest toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">bottom half  12</span>   b . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  is preferably formed of metal, although other materials, for example a ceramic material, can be used, if desired. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  preferably includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">curvature  38</span>  along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  as is common with prior art types of nail clippers (not shown).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0047]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  small piece of planar material is sharpened and bent (if desired) prior to insertion into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">first recess  30</span> . As such, the cost of manufacture of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  is minimal.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0048]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">bottom half  12</span>   b  includes a second enlarged front portion, identified in general by the reference numeral  40 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">second enlarged front portion  40</span>  is a mirror in construction and composition to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">first enlarged front  22</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0049]    A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second blade  34</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">second enlarged front  40</span>  is identical to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span> , just oriented upside down with respect thereto.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0050]    A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second blade  34</span>   a  aligns with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">bottom half  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame member  12</span>  are urged together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0051]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower half  12</span>   b  are urged toward each other when a force sufficient to overcome hysteresis and the force of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring  14</span>  is applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  in the direction and location of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">arrow  42</span>  and to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">bottom half  12</span>   b  in the direction and location of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">opposite arrow  44</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0052]    When urged together, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  align perfectly with respect to each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0053]    A finger nail (not shown) or a toe nail (not shown) is inserted between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second blade  34</span>   a  and is severed by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  and by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  when sufficient force is applied to urge the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">upper half  12</span>   a  and to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">bottom half  12</span>   b  toward each other.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0054]    Typically, a thumb and finger of a user can supply sufficient force to sever the nail. If desire, the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  is modified to include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lever  52</span>  (see  FIG. 2 ) to apply greater force to urge the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0055]    If desired, an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">advertisement  46</span>  is provided wherever preferred on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame member  12</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0056]    Because the cost of manufacture is so little for the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> , they can be sold at very low cost, used for a period of time until the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  become dull, and then disposed of.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0057]    If the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring  14</span>  is eliminated, other than the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second blade  34</span>   a  there is no metal. Of course, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring  14</span>  could be changed from a coil-type of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring  14</span>  to include a leaf-type of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring  14</span>  that is disposed further toward the rear of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  (not shown) than is the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">spring  14</span> , as shown. This makes the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  lightweight and very inexpensive to manufacture.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0058]    Unlike all known prior art types of nail clippers, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second blade  34</span>   a  are separate parts. They are not formed of a continuous piece of metal (as is the prior art). Because the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">blade  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second blade  34</span>   a  are not continuous, precision machining of the each prior art cutting edge with respect to the other is eliminated.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0059]    This greatly reduces the cost of manufacture because the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">blade  24</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second blade  34</span>   a , being separate components, are easy to manufacture and to machine the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a.     </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0060]    Luxury hotels can provide the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  for free or at low cost. Manufacturers of any type of a product who wish to increase customer awareness of their products (or services) can include their name, telephone number, and website as part of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">advertisement  46</span> . The manufacturers may wish to give the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  away for free.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0061]    Every time a person who has received one for free cuts his or her finger nails or toe nails, they are apt to be reminded of the manufacturer and to think favorably of the manufacturer. If repeated enough times, when a purchase decision is required by the person for a product offered by the manufacturer, it is likely that the name of the manufacturer will spring favorably to mind.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0062]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame member  12</span>  can be any desired color of plastic. For example, a pink color of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">frame member  12</span>  may appeal to girls and women whereas another color may be more likely to appeal to boys and men.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0063]    Furthermore, because there is so little metal, airport security devices are not likely to detect the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  during security screening. This prevents delays and possible confiscation of the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  by overly zealous security personnel.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0064]    Referring now primarily to  FIG. 2  is shown, a second disposable type of a nail clipper with blade-insert, identified in general by the reference numeral  50 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0065]    A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">plastic lever  52</span>  is pivotally attached to a top of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">vertical plastic pin  54</span>  by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">horizontal pin  55</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">pin  54</span>  passes through a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">pin hole  56</span>  provided in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">first modified frame member  58</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0066]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">pin  54</span>  continues to pass through a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">second pin hole  60</span>  provided in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">first modified frame member  58</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span>  are identical, just inverted with respect to each other. They are each formed of plastic or nylon preferably and include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">center wedge  64</span>  at an end opposite to where the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">pin  54</span>  is disposed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0067]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">pin  54</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">split bottom  54</span>   a . The two opposite sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">split bottom  54</span>   a  are urged together sufficient to pass through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">second pin hole  60</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem65">pin wedge  65</span>  is urged into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">split bottom  54</span>   a  sufficient to spread the two opposite sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">split bottom  54</span>   a  apart an amount sufficient to prevent the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">split bottom  54</span>   a  from passing back up and through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">second pin hole  60</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0068]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">first modified frame member  58</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span>  are preferably planar members that approximate the size of current prior art types of nail clippers. Prior art types of nail clippers come in a variety of sizes and it is to be understood that the instant invention can similarly be provided in a variety of sizes.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0069]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">wedge  64</span>  is either welded (by ultrasound or other means) or adhered (by an adhesive) to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">first modified frame member  58</span>  and to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span> . Injection molding or other known or future manufacturing techniques can, of course, be used to form any version of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> ,  50  ( 100 ,  150 ,  200 , as described hereinafter).  </p>

If desired, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">wedge  64</span>  is molded as an integral part of the second disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">blade-insert  50</span>  so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">wedge  64</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">first modified frame member  58</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span>  are one continuous piece.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0071]    A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first modified blade  70</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">blade hole  72</span>  through which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">pin  54</span>  passes. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first modified blade  70</span>  includes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  which is substantially identical to that of the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first modified blade  70</span>  is attached at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">front  66</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">first modified frame member  58</span>  by adhesive or any preferred means.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0072]    A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">second modified blade  74</span>  is identical to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first modified blade  70</span>  and is similarly attached in an inverted fashion to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span>  so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">second modified blade  74</span>  are aligned with respect to each other and face each other, as they did on the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0073]    When the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lever  52</span>  is depressed in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">arrow  76</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">fulcrum  78</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">lever  54</span>  applies a mechanical advantage to the top of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">first modified frame member  58</span>  sufficient to urge it toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0074]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">pin  54</span>  prevents the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span>  from moving away from <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">first modified frame member  58</span>  as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">lever  52</span>  is depressed. This causes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">second modified blade  74</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first modified blade  70</span>  to move toward each other until the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  align with each other and any finger nail or toe nail placed there-between has been severed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0075]    The second disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">blade-insert  50</span>  shares the advantages of being lightweight, inexpensive to manufacture, low cost of purchase, space for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">advertisement  46</span> , and because of little metal, freedom from detection by airport security devices of the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0076]    If desired, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem79">retainer clip  79</span>  can be inserted over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">opposite rear  68</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">first modified frame member  58</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">wedge  64</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">second modified frame member  62</span>  to secure them together. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem79">retainer clip  79</span>  if formed of metal or any preferred material and can be crimped in place to provide a low-cost manufacturing method.  </p>

                        <p>          [0080]    The third disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">blade-insert  100</span>  provides the advantages of the previously described embodiments.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0081]    Referring now primarily to  FIG. 4  is shown a portion of a first half of a first replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with blade-insert, identified in general by the reference numeral  150 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0082]    A replacement blade assembly, identified in general by the reference numeral  152  is shown in a spaced-apart orientation, ready for insertion into an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem154">open end  154</span>  of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem156">third modified frame member  156</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0083]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  is similar to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">front portion  102</span>   a  of the third disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">blade-insert  100</span> . However, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  is detachably-attachable with respect to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem156">third modified frame member  156</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0084]    A pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem158">tangs  158</span> ,  160  extend from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  and each include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem162">respective beveled leading edge  162</span> ,  164 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem162">Each leading edge  162</span> ,  164  will extend progressively further away from a center of the replacement blade assembly as it passes toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">third modified blade  106</span>  until it terminates at a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem166">retaining edge  166</span> ,  168  that are each perpendicular with respect to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem170">arrow  170</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0085]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assemblies  152</span>  are expected to be sold in pairs for replacement of a prior set when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a  of the first replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">blade-insert  152</span>  become dull.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0086]    To remove a previously used <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">and now dull replacement blade assembly  152</span>  from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem156">third modified frame member  156</span>  (or bottom member; not shown), a force is simultaneously applied through a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem172">side openings  172</span> ,  174  that are provided in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem156">third modified frame member  156</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem162">two leading edges  162</span> ,  164 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0087]    The two leading edges are urged toward each other an amount sufficient to permit the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem166">retaining edges  166</span> ,  168  to clear the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem172">side openings  172</span> ,  174 . The pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem158">tangs  158</span> ,  160  bend inward in response to the force that is applied.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0088]    A force in the opposite direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem170">arrow  170</span>  is also simultaneously applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem162">leading edges  162</span> ,  164  are depressed. When the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem166">retaining edges  166</span> ,  168  clear the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem172">side openings  172</span> ,  174 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  is pulled out of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem154">open end  154</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem156">third modified frame member  156</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0089]    This is repeated for both the first (top) half of the first replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">blade-insert  150</span>  and also for the second (bottom) half (not shown).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0090]    To insert a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">new replacement blade assembly  152</span>  after an older one has been removed, it is simply oriented as shown in the drawing and urged in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem170">arrow  170</span>  until a click is heard as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem166">retaining edges  166</span> ,  168  pass beyond the front edge of each of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem172">side openings  172</span> ,  174 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  is accordingly held in position. Furthermore, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edge  36</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">top replacement blade assembly  152</span>  is aligned with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">second cutting edge  36</span>   a  (not shown) of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">bottom replacement blade assembly  152</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0091]    An additional benefit is provided over the previous embodiments described herein. The additional benefit is that the first replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">blade-insert  150</span>  can be restored to like-new cutting ability by periodically replacing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assemblies  152</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assemblies  152</span>  are a consumable item, similar to razor blades, which can prove to be as profitable or potentially even more profitable than the sale of the first replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">blade-insert  150</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0092]    Referring now primarily to  FIG. 5  and also to  FIG. 6  is shown a portion of a first half of a second replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with blade-insert, identified in general by the reference numeral  200 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0093]    <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">A second replacement blade assembly  202</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204">modified blade  204</span>  that is attached to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206">channel member  206</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204">modified blade  204</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206">channel member  206</span>  are preferably formed of steel. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem206">channel member  206</span>  in cross-section ( FIG. 6 ) includes a generally rectangular “C-shape” that is adapted to slide over an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem208">end  208</span>  of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">fourth modified frame member  210</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0094]    <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">The second replacement blade assembly  202</span>  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">alignment hole  212</span> .

                        <p>          [0095]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">alignment protrusion  214</span>  disposed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">alignment hole  212</span>  provides two benefits. Together, they ensure that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second replacement blade assembly  202</span>  is fully and properly inserted on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">fourth modified frame member  210</span>  and they help retain the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second replacement blade assembly  202</span>  in position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0096]    To ensure that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second replacement blade assembly  202</span>  is not inserted too far onto the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">fourth modified frame member  210</span> , an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem216">elevated ridge  216</span>  is preferably included as part of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">fourth modified frame member  210</span>  that prevents over-insertion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second replacement blade assembly  202</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0097]    To remove the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second replacement blade assembly  202</span>  from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">fourth modified frame member  210</span>  it is grasped and sufficient force is applied in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem218">arrow  218</span>  while retaining the remainder of the second replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with blade-insert, identified in general by the reference numeral  200 . The resistance provided by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">alignment protrusion  214</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">alignment hole  212</span>  is overcome and the second replacement blade assembly is separated apart from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem210">fourth modified frame member  210</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0098]    To add <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">a new second replacement blade assembly  202</span>  it is urged in a direction opposite that of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem218">arrow  218</span>  until the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">alignment protrusion  214</span>  is in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">alignment hole  212</span>  and a rear edge of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second replacement blade assembly  202</span>  is disposed against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem216">elevated ridge  216</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0099]    Of course, when replacement is warranted, two of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">the second replacement blade assemblies  202</span>  are used at both the top and bottom halves of the second replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">blade-insert  200</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0100]    If desired, the instant invention can, of course, be modified for use with the disclosure of the related patent application that was identified in the first sentence of the specification in such a way as to eliminate the prior art type of clipper that was used and to replace it with one of the embodiments, as described herein.

                        <p>          [0101]    For example, referring now primarily to  FIG. 7  is shown, a fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with blade-insert, identified in general by the reference numeral  250 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0102]    The fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">blade-insert  250</span>  is similar to the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> . However, the fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">blade-insert  250</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem252">raised pivot area  252</span>  in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem254">bottom half  254</span>  of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem256">further modified frame member  256</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem256">further modified frame member  256</span>  is preferably formed of plastic or nylon (not metal).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0103]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem252">raised pivot area  252</span>  extends across the width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem254">bottom half  254</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span>  is preferably formed of a plastic or nylon and pivots about a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem260">bottom pivot pin  260</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem260">bottom pivot pin  260</span>  passes through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem252">raised pivot area  252</span>  and also through a bottom end of a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem262">opposite lower sides  262</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span>  is similar in design to that which was disclosed in the above-referenced pending patent application.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0104]    If desired, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem260">bottom pivot pin  260</span>  can eliminated and a pair of modified bottom pivot pins (not shown) can instead be provided. The modified bottom pivot pins are each molded as a cylindrical extension to each of the pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem262">opposite lower sides  262</span>  proximate the bottom thereof and extending inward a predetermined distance toward each other. A corresponding cylindrical opening is provided on each side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem252">raised pivot area  252</span>  to receive one of the pair of modified bottom pivot pins.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0105]    This can help to lower manufacturing and assembly cost. To assemble the fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">blade-insert  250</span>  when the pair of modified bottom pivot pins are used, the pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem262">opposite lower sides  262</span>  are urged apart an amount sufficient to permit each of the modified bottom pivot pins to enter into the corresponding cylindrical openings in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem252">raised pivot area  252</span> , where they are urged inward by their own elastomeric properties. The modified bottom pivot pins then snap into the cylindrical openings where they are retained.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0106]    The pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem262">opposite lower sides  262</span>  (the rear side is not visible) are disposed on opposite sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem256">further modified frame member  256</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span>  includes an opening (as indicated by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem263">bracket  263</span> ) that extends from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem260">bottom pivot pin  260</span>  (i.e., the bottom of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span> ) up to an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem264">upper cross member  264</span> . The opening extends along the length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem262">opposite lower sides  262</span>  as shown by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem263">bracket  263</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0107]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem264">upper cross member  264</span>  extends across the width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span>  and when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span>  is urged in the direction shown by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem266">arrow  266</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span>  bears against and urges an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem268">upper half  268</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem256">further modified frame member  256</span>  toward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem254">bottom half  254</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blade  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second cutting blade  34</span>   a  are then drawn together sufficient to sever a toe nail or a finger nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0108]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem264">upper cross member  264</span>  can extend up to and into a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem270">finger pad  270</span>  or, if preferred, it can extend only partially along the remaining length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span> . For storage, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span>  is pivoted about the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem260">bottom pivot pin  260</span>  in the direction of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem272">arrow  272</span>  until it is disposed under the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem254">bottom half  254</span>  and is adjacent thereto.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0109]    The only metal used in the fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">blade-insert  250</span>  are for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blade  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second cutting blade  34</span>   a  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem260">bottom pivot pin  260</span> . Of course, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem260">bottom pivot pin  260</span>  could be made of a material other than metal, if preferred. Also, if the modified bottom pivot pins are used instead of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem260">bottom pivot pin  260</span> , they would not be formed of metal.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0110]    Accordingly, the fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">blade-insert  250</span>  includes all of the advantages of the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span>  plus the added ease of use that is provided by the mechanical advantage created by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem258">modified lever  258</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0111]    As disclosed, the fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">blade-insert  250</span>  is expected to be used for a period of time and then disposed of. Depending on the quality of construction, the period of time can be less than, equal to, or even longer than that of the known prior-art types of nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0112]    However, if preferred, it can be further modified so that it includes either the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second replacement blade assembly  202</span> , or any other possible type of modified replacement blade assembly (not shown).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0113]    After having had benefit of the instant disclosure, it is anticipated that other and further modifications will be obvious to those possessing ordinary skill.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0114]    For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">first enlarged front portion  22</span>  of the first disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> , the second disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">blade-insert  50</span> , the third disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">blade-insert  100</span> , or the fourth disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem250">blade-insert  250</span>  could each be modified, as desired, so as not to be disposable but to include a preferred type of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span> ,  202  (or newly designed).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0115]    For example, any of the disposable types of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  250  can be modified to include the teachings of the first replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem150">blade-insert  150</span>  ( FIG. 4 ) including a modified replacement blade assembly (not shown).  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0116]    The modified replacement blade assembly would be similar to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  except that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blade  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second cutting blade  34</span>   a  of the modified replacement blade assembly would be attached vertically (as shown in  FIG. 1  or  FIG. 7 ) instead of horizontally, as shown in  FIG. 4 . This is to illustrate only a small sampling of the many modifications that are now possible regarding the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assemblies  152</span> ,  202 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0117]    Similarly, any disposable type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  250  can be modified to include the second replaceable blade type of a nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">blade-insert  200</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0118]    Also, any of the versions herein can include any type of an enclosure (not shown) to retain the nail clippings.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0119]    An additional modification could allow replacement of only the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blade  34</span>  instead of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assembly  152</span>  (or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second replacement blade assembly  202</span> ) which include additional components other than the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blade  34</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0120]    For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">first recess  30</span>  could be modified to secure the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blade  34</span>  in position, allow its withdrawal, and permit the insertion of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">replacement cutting blade  34</span>  therein.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0121]    As an example of a possible way to secure the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blade  34</span>  in a modified type of a first recess (not shown), a modified type of a cutting blade (not shown) could include an opening into which a protrusion that is provided in the modified type of a first recess would engage, similar to way in which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem212">alignment hole  212</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem214">alignment protrusion  214</span>  cooperate.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0122]    The modified type of a cutting blade is grasped and pulled out and another is urged into the modified type of a first recess. This is generally not preferred over use of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem152">replacement blade assemblies  152</span> ,  202  because of the possibility of injury occurring during removal or insertion of the modified type of a cutting blade into the modified type of a first recess.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0123]    Referring now to  FIG. 8 , for any version of the nail clipper with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">blade-insert  10</span> ,  50 ,  100 ,  150 ,  200 ,  250  the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blade  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second cutting blade  34</span>   a  require that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutting edges  36</span> ,  36   a  contact each other when the device is urged into a closed position. The planar portion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">each cutting blade  34</span> ,  34   a  does not have to be vertical or in parallel planar alignment with each other but could be disposed at an angle, if preferred.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0124]    If desired, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blades  34</span> ,  34   a  could be formed of a material other than metal, for example, a ceramic material.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0125]    Other changes are also possible. As is well-known in the nail clipper arts, a radius is included in the cutting edges to provide a curvature to the nails (either toe or finger) when cut. Prior art designs machine the curvature into the cutting edges. However, with any version of the instant invention, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blades  34</span> ,  34   a  can be formed of a flat material stock, if preferred, that is bent to provide the desired amount of curvature during assembly. This provides even lower cost for the manufacture of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting blades  34</span> ,  34   a.     </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0126]    If preferred, any portion of any version of the instant invention as described herein that is formed of a plastic, nylon, or polymer, for example, can include either a solid core or a hollow core. Proper selection of materials and skilful design will, of course, allow minimal use of the plastic, nylon, or polymer. Not only does minimal use reduce manufacturing cost, it also reduces weight, which in turn, can substantially reduce shipping costs. This is especially true when compared with the known prior-art. Also, a lower weight makes portage of the instant invention easier to accomplish, whether it is placed in a pocket, purse, or added to a keychain, for example.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0127]    The invention has been shown, described, and illustrated in substantial detail with reference to the presently preferred embodiment. It will be understood by those skilled in this art that other and further changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention which is defined by the claims appended hereto. </p>
