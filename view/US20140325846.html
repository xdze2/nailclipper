                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A baby safe trimming tool has a first blade and a second blade being curved as to accommodate the curved nature of human nails. The first blade is connected to a first handle opposite a first spring. The second blade is connected to a second handle opposite a second spring, and is pivotally connected to the first blade, wherein a first cutting edge of the first blade is scissionably aligned with a second cutting edge of the second blade. The first spring engages the second spring to provide a restoring force when the first handle and the second handle are squeezed together. The first handle and the second handle can be outfitted in multiple grip configurations in order to provide enhanced comfort and grip for a user, wherein a grooved grip area or a loop may be provided for either the first handle or the second handle. </p>

                        <p>        [0002]    The present invention relates generally to a shearing apparatus. More specifically, the present invention is a baby safe trimming tool that is designed to allow a user to safely trim the fingernails and toenails of a baby with minimal risk of the user inflicting injury on the baby.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0003]    Personal hygiene is a very important part of modern society. There are many components that combine to make up the general term of personal hygiene. Some examples of actions which fall within the realm of personal hygiene include, but are not limited to, brushing teeth, flossing, showering, washing hands, and trimming nails. The trimming of nails may not seem to be linked to personal hygiene, but it is indeed very important to personal hygiene for at least one reason. Longer nails can promote the collection of dirt and grime underneath the nail, and such dirt and grime can be difficult to remove from under the nail. Additionally, long nails can cause some problems. For example, long fingernails can easily scratch other people. Combine this with the aforementioned accumulation of dirt and grime under the nail, and it is not impossible for a person to sustain a scratch wound which can become infected. Long toenails can be an issue as they may become caught on the interior of socks. The toenail can potentially damage the sock or break off and cause a painful hangnail. Therefore, it is important to maintain shorter fingernails and toenails to ensure that none of the issues described above are experienced.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    There are many ways by which a person can trim their nails. The most common method is through the use of a specially designed nail clipper. It is important to use a nail clipper as opposed to simply using a standard pair of scissors. Although it is possible to trim nails using a standard pair of scissors, however this method is highly risky because of the composition of human nails and their proximity to soft flesh. Human nails are comprised of a hard protein substance known as keratin, which can easily cause a standard pair of scissors to slip during cutting, thereby potentially injuring the owner of the nails. It is also possible for a person to trim their nails by using their teeth, however this method is widely considered to be uncivilized and is indeed not very hygienic as the human mouth harbors a wealth of infectious bacteria.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    There are many different types of nail clippers available on the market, however they are all designed for the same task, to trim the nail efficiently and with minimal risk of injuring the user. All currently available nail clippers are efficient at trimming nails, and are indeed quite safe when a user trims their own nails using them. However, it is very easy for the user to injure another person whose nails they are trimming. This is of particular importance for children and babies who are incapable of trimming their own nails and require a parent to perform this task for them. It can be very easy for the parent to accidentally injure their child when using one of the currently available designs of nail clippers; this is very stressful for all parties involved as the parent is upset over causing their child pain, and the child is upset over being in pain. It is clear that there is significant room for improvement in the field of nail trimming apparatuses.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to introduce a baby safe trimming tool that allows a user to trim the nails of another person with reduced risk of injuring the person whose nails are being trimmed. The present invention accomplishes this through a the unique design of the blades and handle. It is a further object of the present invention to be small and nimble enough such that it can be easily used to trim the smaller nails of a human child.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAIL DESCRIPTIONS OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0023]    All illustrations of the drawings are for the purpose of describing selected versions of the present invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    The present invention is a baby safe trimming tool that allows a user to safely trim the fingernail and a toenails of a baby. While the present invention is intended for use with babies, the baby safe trimming tool can be used on people of any age. The baby safe trimming tool comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first arm  1</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second arm  2</span>  that are pivotally connected to each other. By manipulating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first arm  1</span>  in relation to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second arm  2</span> , or vice versa, the present invention produces a shearing force that is used to cut through the fingernails or toenails of an individual.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]    In reference to  FIG. 1 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first arm  1</span>  comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">hinge  13</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first spring  12</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first arm  1</span>  may be constructed from any number of different materials, however, metal is the most appropriate choice and is the material used in the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  is thin and has a slight curve as can be seen in  FIG. 1 , and is adjacently connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span> . Furthermore, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">first blunt end  102</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">first cutting edge  101</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">first cutting edge  101</span>  is positioned along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  and is a sharpened edge that allows the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  to slice through the tough keratin of human nails. The slight curve is present because most human nails have a natural curve at the terminating end of each of the nails. By matching the curve of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  to the curve at the terminating end of the nails as closely as possible, the cutting efficiency of the present invention is maximized.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]    In reference to  FIG. 2-3 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">first blunt end  102</span>  is positioned on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span>  and prevents the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  from being used in a stabbing manner. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">first blunt end  102</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  is rounded such that there is no sharp point that is capable of piercing human flesh. As babies move around quite often, there is the opportunity for the user to miscalculate maneuvering the present invention. In such an instance, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">first blunt end  102</span>  would prevent the baby from being stabbed by the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]    In reference to  FIG. 1-2 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">hinge  13</span>  provides a point of connection between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first arm  1</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second arm  2</span> . Furthermore, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">hinge  13</span>  connects the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first arm  1</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second arm  2</span>  in a way such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first arm  1</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second arm  2</span>  are allowed to rotate relative to one another, as depicted in  FIG. 7-8 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">hinge  13</span>  may be formed by a small pin, rod, rivet, fastener, etc. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">hinge  13</span>  is perpendicularly connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span> , wherein a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">hinge axis  3</span>  traverses along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">hinge  13</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">hinge  13</span>  is positioned adjacent to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span> . The end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span>  is curved towards the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">hinge axis  3</span> , such that a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103">mid-curve  103</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  is coplanar with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">hinge axis  3</span> , wherein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103">mid-curve  103</span>  is coplanar with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">mid-plane  104</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span> , as depicted in  FIG. 5 . In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">hinge  13</span>  cavity is positioned into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  section, adjacent to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">hinge  13</span>  cavity is a circular hole which is drilled into the material of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first arm  1</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">hinge  13</span>  is positioned into and connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  via the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">hinge  13</span>  cavity.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]    In reference to  FIG. 2 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span>  section is adjacently connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  just after the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">hinge  13</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span>  is tapered towards the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span> , such that the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span>  opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  is substantially wider than the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span>  adjacent to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span> , as to provide sufficient surface area for gripping and squeezing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span> . The width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span>  is large enough such that the user can comfortably apply force to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span> , and such that the present invention is sufficiently stable while being operated by the user. In reference to  FIG. 2-3 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first spring  12</span>  is adjacently connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span>  opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first spring  12</span>  is constructed from a much thinner piece of material relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span>  section. Additionally, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first spring  12</span>  is thin enough such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first spring  12</span>  is able to elastically deform from the application of small amounts of force. When a force is applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first arm  1</span>  through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span> , the force acts to deform the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first spring  12</span> . As the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first spring  12</span>  is deformed, energy is stored within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first spring  12</span> , and when the force is removed from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first arm  1</span> , the energy is released, thus returning the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first spring  12</span>  to the original shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first spring  12</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0029]    In reference to  FIG. 1 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second arm  2</span>  comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">hinge hole  23</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second arm  2</span>  may be constructed from any number of different materials, however, metal is the most appropriate choice and is the material used in the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span>  is thin and has a slight curve as can be seen in  FIG. 1 , and is adjacently connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span> . Furthermore, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span>  comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second blunt end  202</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem201">second cutting edge  201</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem201">second cutting edge  201</span>  is positioned along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span>  and is a sharpened edge that allows the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span>  to slice through the tough keratin of human nails. The slight curve is present because most human nails have a natural curve at the terminating end of each of the nails. By matching the curve of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span>  to the curve at the terminating end of the nails as closely as possible, the cutting efficiency of the present invention is maximized.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0030]    In reference to  FIG. 2  and  FIG. 4 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second blunt end  202</span>  is positioned on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span>  opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span>  and prevents the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span>  from being used in a stabbing manner. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem202">second blunt end  202</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span>  is rounded such that there is no sharp point that is capable of piercing human flesh.

                        <p>          [0031]    In reference to  FIG. 1-2 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">hinge hole  23</span>  provides a point of connection between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first arm  1</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second arm  2</span> . Furthermore, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">hinge  13</span>  connects the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first arm  1</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second arm  2</span>  in a way such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first arm  1</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second arm  2</span>  are allowed to rotate relative to one another, as depicted in  FIG. 7-8 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">hinge hole  23</span>  traverses through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span>  and is positioned adjacent to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span> . The end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span>  opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span>  is curved towards the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">hinge axis  3</span>  running through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">hinge  13</span> , such that a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem203">mid-curve  203</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span>  is coplanar with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">hinge axis  3</span> , wherein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem203">mid-curve  203</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span>  is coplanar with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem204">mid-plane  204</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span> .

The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span>  is tapered towards the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span> , such that the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span>  opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span>  is substantially wider than the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span>  adjacent to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span> , as to provide sufficient surface area for gripping and squeezing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span> . The width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span>  is large enough such that the user can comfortably apply force to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span> , and such that the present invention is sufficiently stable while being operated by the user.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0033]    In reference to  FIG. 2  and  FIG. 4 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span>  is adjacently connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span>  opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span>  is constructed from a much thinner piece of material relative to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span>  section.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0034]    Additionally, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span>  is thin enough such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span>  is able to elastically deform from the application of small amounts of force. When a force is applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second arm  2</span>  through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span> , the force acts to deform the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span> . As the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span>  is deformed, energy is stored within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span> , and when the force is removed from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second arm  2</span> , the energy is released, thus returning the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span>  to the original shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0035]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first spring  12</span>  engages the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span>  opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span> , such that when a force is applied to either the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first arm  1</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second arm  2</span> , both the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first spring  12</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span>  deform. In reference to  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0036]      FIG. 3 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first spring  12</span>  comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem121">spring notch  121</span> , while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span>  comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem221">spring tab  221</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem221">spring tab  221</span>  is positioned on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span>  opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span> , wherein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem221">spring tab  221</span>  has a smaller width than the remainder of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem121">spring notch  121</span>  is positioned through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first spring  12</span>  opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span> , and provides an opening with a width slightly larger than the width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem221">spring tab  221</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem221">spring tab  221</span>  engages the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem121">spring notch  121</span> , wherein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem221">spring tab  221</span>  traverses through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem121">spring notch  121</span> , thus securely engaging the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first spring  12</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0037]    The present invention is operable between an open configuration, as shown in  FIG. 1 , and a closed configuration, as shown in  FIG. 7 , wherein the open configuration is achieved by applying zero force to either the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span>  or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span> . In the open configuration, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span>  are positioned adjacent to each other, such that there is a gap between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">first cutting edge  101</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem201">second cutting edge  201</span>  for positioning the material to be cut. Both the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first spring  12</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span>  are in the original, non-deformed shape, and engage each other such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first arm  1</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second arm  2</span>  cannot freely pivot about the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">hinge axis  3</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0038]    The closed configuration is achieved by applying a force to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">fir<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">st handle  11</span>  or second handle  21</span>  in order to overcome the spring force of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first spring  12</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span> . As the force is applied by the user, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">first spring  12</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span>  collapse, allowing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first arm  1</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second arm  2</span>  to pivot about the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">hinge axis  3</span> . As the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first arm  1</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second arm  2</span>  pivot, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">first cutting edge  101</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem201">second cutting edge  201</span>  progressively engage each other, producing a shear force to cut material positioned in the gap between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span> . The closed configuration is reached when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span>  completely overlap each other, wherein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span>  are flush with one another. At this point, the material positioned in the gap between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first blade  10</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second blade  20</span>  will be fully cut along the length of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">first cutting edge  101</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem201">second cutting edge  201</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0039]    In reference to  FIG. 2 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span>  comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem213">stop  213</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem213">stop  213</span>  is positioned in between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span> , and is positioned adjacent to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">second spring  22</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem213">stop  213</span>  is a protrusion that extends out from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span>  towards the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span> . When in the closed configuration, the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem213">stop  213</span>  opposite the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">second handle  21</span>  engages the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">first handle  11</span> , as shown in  FIG. 8 , thus preventing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first arm  1</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second arm  2</span>  from pivoting any further.  </p>
