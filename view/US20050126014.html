                        <p>      FIELD OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]     The present invention relates generally to the field of cutting devices and specifically relates to cutting tools comprising a locking means in the form of an integral screw. In particular, the invention relates to a cutting device comprising an integral spring, capable of facilitating opening of the blades. According to a preferred embodiment of this invention, the device comprises a locking screw and integral spring in scissors, clippers and nippers. According to the preferred embodiment, the blades are self-sharpening.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0003]     Cutting implements and tools have long been in use for cutting hair, cloth, plants, paper, and other materials. Cutting tools are more efficient where the user only needs to use one hand to manipulate the device. Thus the other hand is free to hold or guide the material during the cutting process. Thus, cutting tools were formed that had blades pivotally attached with handles. Specifically, scissor handles often have finger and thumb loops while clippers, shears and nippers have handles that are operated by the thumb and a gripping motion. To manipulate the scissors and nippers they must be manually opened and closed upon the object to be cut. Thus a need exists for a cutting device that is capable of self-opening after each cut to facilitate the cutting process.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]     Repetitive motions such as cutting using cutting devices such as scissors, shears, clippers or nippers are an identifiable cause of carpal tunnel syndrome in some users. A device, which relieves the stress caused by the repetitive opening and closing motion is therefore very desirable. The spring action of the present invention solves this problem.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]     Cutting devices, particularly for use in manicures and pedicures have been described. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,722,171; U.S. Pat. No. 3,651,573; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,299,030). Cutting tools contain sharp blades. Therefore, they can be very dangerous is left in an open position with the cutting surface exposed. Cutting tools with a blade lock have been described. (U.S. Pat. No. 3,651,573; U.S. Pat. No. 4,452,246; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,567,656). However, the previously described locking mechanisms described are relatively difficult to manipulate, not completely reliable in operation and only work on a specific type of cutting implement. They often operate by affecting a change in the tension, or tightness between the blades or they represent an external lock mechanism. Thus, a need exists for an integral locking means that is easily manipulated, reliable and works on many types of cutting devices and is independent of blade tension.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]     The present invention provides distinct advantages over the prior art and solves numerous problems long described and understood in the field.   </p>

                        <p>          [0026]     The invention further comprises an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem501">integral spring means  501</span>  for facilitating moving the first cutting blade and the second cutting blade into the open position. According to a preferred embodiment the integral spring means is partially positioned within an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem502">integral spring canal  502</span>  located on the first cutting blade and partially within a corresponding integral spring canal located on the second cutting blade, situated in such a way as to create tension pushing the first cutting blade tip away from the second cutting blade tip. According to a preferred embodiment, the integral spring means is a leaf spring. A leaf spring is a short, shaped element, which when compressed from end to end increases tension within the spring. According to the present invention, tension on the spring is increased when the first cutting blade and the second cutting blade are in the closed position. Without counter tension pushing the first cutting blade tip towards the second cutting blade tip, the integral spring means will push the tips apart. The integral locking screw means can prevent such opening when the integral locking screw means is fastened to the receiving opening when the device is in the closed position. According to a preferred embodiment of this invention, the integral spring is comprised of stainless steel, but may be comprised of other metals including but not limited to aluminum, titanium, copper and brass. Alternatively, the integral spring may be comprised of composite materials or plastic. According to a preferred embodiment, the integral spring is a leaf spring. However, the present invention specifically contemplates the use of any other spring, which can create tension inducing the tips to move towards the open position. Such spring types include but are not limited to coil springs, barrel springs, tension springs, compression springs, torsion springs, all of which are well known to one of skill in the art.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]      FIGS. 3-10  exemplify various forms of the provided device, including scissors, nippers and clippers.  FIG. 10  shows clippers using a barrel spring, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem601">barrel spring  601</span>  situated between the handle ends of the opposing cutting blades, thereby facilitating opening under spring tension.   </p>
