                        <p>  To<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> all wh<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">om if 7</span>)L(l 7</span>/ courier-11,:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   .Be it known that l, ALBERT M. Woosrnn, a citizen of the United States, residing at Bridgeport, county of Foiriield, State of Connecticut, have invented s new and useful Nail-Clipper, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention relates to the class of nailclippers in which two members are connected together at one end, are provided with cuttors at the other end, which are normally held apart either by a spring or by the resiliency of one or both of the members themselves and in which the cutters are moved to the closed or operative position by means of a lever pivoted to one of the members and bearing upon the other member; and the invention has for its object to provide a. nailclippcr oi this character in which a lover of the second order pivoted to one member and not connected to the other member shall have its fulcrum on a cross-pin in the other member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The invention further consists in certain details of construction which will be hereinalter fully described and then specifically pomted out in the claims hereunto appem&#39;lcd.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the accompanying drawings, forming a port of this specification, Figure 1 is a plan view of my novel clipper in the closed position; Fig. 2 a longitudinal section on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> line 2</span> 2 in Fig. 1 looking in the direction of the arrow, the cutters being in the open position; and Fig. 3 is a transverse section on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> line 3</span> 3 in Fig. looking in the direction of the arrow.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   10 denotes in member which for convenience I will term the upper member, and 11 a member which for convenience l. will term the lower member. Both members are struck out and formed from shoot me ml and are connected together at one end by a stud or rivet, (indicated by 12.)   </p>
                    
                        <p>  per member is provided at its opposite end The upwith a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> cutter 13</span> and the lower member with l o coacting cutter 14-. in the form of clipper illustrated in the drawings the members are nornuilly separated by the resiliency of the lower member. The lower member 1s pro vidcd with an upwordlymxtcnding stud l5, lying wholly between the members, to which the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> head 16</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> lever 17</span> is pivoted, as at 20. This lever extends through a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> slot 18</span> in the upper member and has its fulcrum on a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> cross-pin 19</span> in the upper member. The head of the lever is so formed and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> pivot 20</span>&#39;s0 l l l l l l ,full width of the under surface located that when the jaws are in the open position, as in Fig. 2,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> pivot 20</span> will lie in a plane below the plane of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> cross-pin 19</span>, which is the fulcrum, so that when the operator presses down upon the free end of the lever the cutters will be moved to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> closed or 6</span>})- erative position. In the closed position, as in Fig. 1, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lever posses down into slot 18</span> in the upper member. This structure enables the wceringsurfeccs to be provided practically proportioned to the amount of movement or rubbing contact to which they are subjected in use. In use greater friction occurs between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> pin 19</span> and the under surface of the lever than at the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> ivot 20</span>, and this greater friction is borne y the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> entire 7</span> of the lever and the surface of the,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> pin 19</span>, which, being straight, can easily and economically be nnidc of the 1) Pet of metal to stand the wean, such as hardened steel, if desired. On the other hand, as the movement is relotively slight at the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> pivot 20</span> the foot that a lesser amount of metal of the lever is cngcqed with said pivot does not shorten the life oi the implemcnt.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The lever is locked in the closed position by means of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> slide 21</span> on the under side of the lever, the forward end of which is adopted topass under the metal of the upper member at the end of the slotto lock the lever in the closed position, the point of locking engagement with the slide being indicated by 22 in Fig. 2. The slide is operated by means of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> n finger-piece 28</span>, lying upon the top of the lever, which is connected with the slide by means of c stud. 24, which passes through a slot in the levo shown by dottc lines only. The slide is retained against Stll except longitudinal movement by&#39;niczms of a tailpiece-1Z6, the tip of which engages a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> slot 27</span>, indicated by dotted lines only.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   28 denotes a nail-cleaner which is adopted to be retracted be tween the members or to be projected for use, as indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 2. This nail-clcener lies on the upper side of the lower member and posses through a.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> slot 29</span> in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> stud 12</span> and a.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> slot 30</span> in the end of the upper member. t is operated by means of o.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem81"> ringer-piece 81</span>, vhich is connected to the nail-cleaner by means of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> it stud 33</span>, which passes through a. slot- 32 in the lower member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having thus described my invention, I claim--- 1. A nail-clipper comprising two members IIO having cutters,-1neans for normally sepae rating the cutters, a lever having its inner end pivoted to the lower member, and a cross-pin supported by the other member and extending under the lever, the said lever bearing loosely on the cross-pin.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  2. A nail-clipper comprising two men&#39;i&#39;bers having cutters, means for normally sepa rating the cutters, an angular lever having its inner end pivoted to the lower member, and a cross-pin supported by the other nezm her and extending under the angle of the lever, the said lever hearing loosely on the to the stud, said lever passing&#34; through the slot and bearing loosely on the cross-pin.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   4. A nail-clipper comprising members provided with cutters, one of said members having an inwardly-projecting stud and the other member a slot and cross-pin, a lever passing through the slot and having a head pivoted at its inner end on the stud and its bearing on the eross-pin, and a slide on said lever adapted to engage the metal at the end of the slot to lock the cutters at the closed position when the lever is pressed into the slot.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In testimony whereof I aflix my signature in presence of two witnesses.   </p>
