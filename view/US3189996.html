Casey, Jr., 3570 Autumn Ave., Memphis, Tenn. Filed Nov. 6, 1963, Ser. No. 321,818 3 Claims. (Cl. 30-28) This invention relates to improvements in nail clippers, particularly clippers designed for the cutting of fingernails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Nail clippers of the type with which the present in vention is concerned, while being portable because of size and compactness, are nevertheless often dangerous because of the exposed cutting edges thereon which are also liable to cause damage to material and fabric adjacent thereto which may be caught on the sharp cutting edges. It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide an improved nail clipper of the aforementioned type which is safer to carry and less likely to damage material in contact therewith.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   An additional object of the present invention is to provide an improved nail clipper of the aforementioned type incorporating a protective safety feature which is relatively inexpensive.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A still further object of the present invention is to provide a nail clipper embodying a protective safety feature that is reliable and which does not disturb the compact nature of the type of nail clipper involved.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  These together with other objects and advantages which will become subsequently apparent reside in the details of construction and operation as more fully hereinafter described and claimed, reference being had to the accompanying drawings forming a part hereof, wherein like numerals refer to like parts throughout, and in which:   </p>

                        <p>   FIGURE 7 is a perspective view of the disassembled parts of the nail clipper.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring now to the drawings in detail, it will be observed from FIGURE 1 that the nail clipper generally referred to by reference numeral 10 is in an active or actuating position, held in one hand of the user for cutting the fingernails of the other hand. The nail clipper is of the type which involves a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> elonga<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">ted spring leaves 12 and 14</span></span> secured together at<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> one end 16</span> by any suitable means such as by brazing. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> opposi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">te unsecured ends 18 and 20</span></span> of the spring leaves are resiliently held spread apart by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> stud 22</span>. Pivotally mounted on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> stud 22</span> is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> pressure bar 24</span> adapted to be rotationally displaced between an actuating position illustrated in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> FIG- URE 1</span> and shown by dotted line in FIGURE 6 and a closed position shown in FIGURE 2 and by solid line in FIGURE 6.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Nail clippers of the aforementioned type are well known in that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> upper spring leaf 12</span> is provided with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> end portion 26</span> adapted to be secured to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> end portion 28</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> lower spring leaf 14</span> as more clearly seen in FIGURE 7, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> opposi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">te operative ends 18 and 20</span></span> of the spring leaves being separated by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> stud 22</span> &#34;ice firmly secured to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> leaf 14</span> within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> aperture 30</span> thereof, the stud having its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> head portion 32</span> engaging the underside of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> leaf 14</span> adjacent to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> end 20</span>. The shank of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> stud 22</span> therefore slidably extends through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> aperture 34</span> formed adjacent the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> end 18</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> leaf 12</span> so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> notch 36</span> formed in the shank of the stud may pivotally receive the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> pivot projections 38</span> which extend from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> bifurcated end portion 40</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> pressure bar 24</span>. The pressure bar is therefore provided with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> elongated actuating portion 42</span> one side of which includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> filing surface 44</span> exposed upwardly when the pressure bar is in the actuating position shown in FIGURE 1. An<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> actuating pressure projection 46</span> is formed on the surface of the pressure bar opposite the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> filing surface 44</span> adjacent to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> end portion 40</span>, so that when the pressure bar is in the actuating position, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> projection 46</span> will bear against the upper surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> leaf 12</span> adjacent the op-&#39;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> erative end 18</span> in order to permit the user to slidably displace the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> upper leaf 12</span> towards the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> lower leaf 14</span> in order to effect the cutting action. The pressure bar when rotationally displaced from the actuating position by degrees, in a plane perpendicular to the axis through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> stud 22</span>, may then be angularly displaced toward the closed or inactive position illustrated in FIGURES 2, 3 and 6 with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> projection 46</span> extending upwardly and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> elongated actuating portion 42</span> engaging the top surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> upper leaf 12</span> at its end. p   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The upper and lower leaves are respectively provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">g elements 48 and 50</span></span> which are arcuate in shape for shaped cutting of the fingernails. The cutting elements are therefore provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> arcuat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">e knife cutting edges 52 and 54</span></span> which confront each other. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> cutting element 48</span> therefore extends downwardly from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> upper leaf 12</span> and is located within a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> lateral recess 56</span> formed on<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> one longitudinal side 58</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> leaf 12</span> adjacent to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> operative end 18</span>. It will therefore be observed, that the pressure bar will have its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> pressure projection 46</span> aligned with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> cutting element 48</span> so that upon slidable displacement, maximum pressure will be applied to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> cutting element 48</span> bringing it toward the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> cutting element 50</span> projecting upwardly from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> lower leaf 14</span>. The lower leaf is therefore also provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> recess 60</span> on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> longitudinal side 62</span> thereof aligned with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> recess 56</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> upper leaf 12</span>. It will therefore be apparent, that the disposition of the cutting ele&#39;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> ments <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">48 and 50</span></span> recessed inwardly from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> longit<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">udinal sides 58 and 62</span></span>, will not only bring them closer to the point of maximum pressure applied by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> pressure projection 46</span>, but will also render the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> knife <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">edges 52 and 54</span></span> less exposed.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In order .to provide complete shielding protection for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">g elements 48 and 50</span></span>, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> pressure bar 24</span> is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> guard projection 64</span> which exte<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">nds laterally fr-om one longitudinal side 66</span> of the pressure bar adjacent to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> pressure projection 46</span> so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> guard 64</span> may be aligned with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> recess<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">es 56 and 60</span></span> in the spring leaves when the pressure bar is in the closed position. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> guard projection 64</span> therefore is spaced from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> longitudinal side 66</span> of the pressure bar and extends perpendicular thereto in protective shielding relation to the cutting elements as more clearly seen in FIGURE 4, when the pressure bar is in the closed position. In the closed position, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> guard projection 64</span> will extend through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> recess<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">es 56 and 60</span></span> and be flush with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> longit<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">udinal sides 62 and 58</span></span> of the leaves as more clearly seen in FIGURE 2. Accordingly, the compact nature of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> in its closed position will be preserved. In order to assure that the pressure bar is in the proper closed position and to avoid lateral displacement of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> guard 64</span> from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> sides <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">58 and 62</span></span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> limit stop 68</span> is formed on the upper surface of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> leaf 12</span> adjacent side ent.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  58 for engagement by the pressure bar as shown in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> FIG- U<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">RES 2 and 5</span></span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  From the foregoing description, the construction, operation and utility of the improved nail clipper will be apparmay be safely carried in the purse or pocket of the user without any danger of injury to the user or damage to fabric. The disposition of the cutting elements Will also :facilitate the cutting action as well as to accommodate the safety guard feature. Also, the shielding protection provided by the guard feature will avoid damage to surfaces that could occur in connection with nail clippers having exposed cutting edges.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invent-ion.
