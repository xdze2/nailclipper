                        <p>  IOUBE, INCORPORATED, NECTICUT NORWALK, CONNECTICUT, ASBIGNOR TO HORAGE A.. SEY- OF NORWALK CONNECTICUT, A CORPORATION 0F CO<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90">N- FINGEB NAIL CLIP Application tiled lay 90</span>, 1929. Serial No. 364,886.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The invention relates in general to a. manicuring im lement of the t pe 1n which two resilient b ades are secure together at one end and have inturned cutters at .the other end and which cutters are moved into operative engagement by means o f a. cam actuating lever secured to a swlvel bolt passed through apertures adjacent the cutter forming ends of the resilient members..   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In such devices as heretofore known 1t was a usual construction to secure the actuating cam lever to the swivel bolt either by means of a pin form of pivot or the actuating lever was secured in place by means of a pm and slot connection. These prior constructlons possessed several inherent disadvantages, the pivot pin form of mounting being difficult to assemble as a cheap factory proposition and the pin and slot form of construction having the disadvantage of permltting an accidental demounting of the assembled parts whensubjected to careless or rough usage.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Accordingly, the primary object of the invention is to provide a simple form of manicure implement of the type above outlined, and which features a simplified form of connection between the swivel bolt and the operatin `cam lever, so as to permit the marketing o such an article at an extremely low price. f   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Broadly, this object of the invention is attained by providing the component parts. as simple one-piece pressings and in providlng the swivel bolt with an undercut notch designed to permit the ready insertion therein of a pivoting cross bar formed on the o erating cam lever at the time it was punc ed to shape.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object of the invention is to pro-y vide in connection with the operating cam lever element of the combination, a form of nail file which will resent a slightly concaved filing surface, esigned to conform, at least roughly, to the configuration of the end &#39;of the finger-nail, and which at the same time can be formed as a art of the stamping d) the operating cam lever, and without necessity of machining the part to provide the requisite concaved filing surface.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This object of the invention is attained by forming on one side of a flat portion of the operating lever a pair of parallel ribs and a series of file ridges disposed between the ribs in such way that the ribs and file `ridged surface form in effect a concave surface.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Various other objects and advantages of the invention will be in part obvious from an inspection of the accompanying drawing and in part will be more fully set forth in the following particular description of one form of mechanism embodyin my invention, and the invention also conslsts in certain new and novel features of construction and combination of parts hereinafter set forth and claimed.   </p>

The forward edges of these flanges are beveled as shown at 26 to form cams adapted to bear on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> portion 16</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> resilient member 10</span> and coacting with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> swivel bolt 20</span> to cause the cutters to approach each other. The portion of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> lever 23</span> between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> flanges 25</span> is recessed to provide a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> bolt aperture 27</span> and the forward side of this aperture is outlined by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> cross bar 28</span>, and in advance of the cross bar the adjacent edge of the lever is provided with an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> end recess 29</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The free end of the operating cam lever is pointed and somewhat flattened as shown at 30 to form a nail cleaner.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   During the process of forming the operating cam lever the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> flat surface 28</span> is subjected to a die pressing operation which forms a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> parall<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">el rounded top ribs 31 and 32</span></span> on one side of the blade, an there is similarly formed on the reverse side a pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> slotte<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">d depressions 33 and 34</span></span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> depres<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">sions 33 and 34</span></span> are provided with a series&#39; of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> transversely extending file ridges 3</span> 5 which form long, narrow file surfaces des1gned to engage the fingernail in filing thesame across the top of the nail and in a directionsubstantially parallel to the plane of the na1l.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> ribs 3<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">1 and 32</span></span> on the reverse side of the lever are a series of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> tiling ridges 36</span> extending parallel to and disposed between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> ribs 3<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">1 and 32</span></span>. lVliile it is true that the portion of the blade provided with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> le ridges 36</span> is substantially flat, the effect of the upstanding rounded top ribs at opposite sides of the filing surface is to form in eii&#39;ect a concaved filing surface designed to conform, at least somewhat roughly, to the configuration of the ends of the fingernails. This construction is designed to permit a ling of the nail while the blade extends substantially perpendicular to the plane of the nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This disclosure features a construction which is designed to economize in manufacturing costs so as to produce an article which can be marketed cheaply. The resilient members as well as the operating lever are simply pressings, and the conventional swivel bolt may be easily provided with the peculiar&#39; hook shaped notch disclosed in Fig. 4. The resilient members l0 and ll are easily welded together at their contacting ends to form the unit shown in Fig. 2. ln assembling the cam operating lever in position it is simply necessary for the assembler to pass the swivel bolt upwardly through the apertures and by manually depressing the resilient members towards the closed portion as shown in Fig. 5 the lever may be positioned in place first by disposing it in the position shown in dotted lines in Fig. 5 and then shoving it towards the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> end 12</span> until the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> cross bar 28</span> engages in the open end oi&#39; the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> notch 22</span>. Releasingr the holding pressure on the resilient members permits the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> portion 16</span> to react on the level&#39; forcing the cross bar upwardly as shown in Fig. 5 and until the cross bar engages the upper closed end of the notch in which position it is held by the resiliency of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> two me<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">mbers 10 and 11</span></span> acting through the swivel bolt. It is apparent from this construction that the cani lever may be disposed in the operative position shown in Figs. 1 and 5 and in which case the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> cam 26</span> is in operative position bearing on the adjacent face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> resilient member 10</span>. Pressing downwardly on the free end ofthe cam lever will cause the cam to rock about its high point and in its effort to elevate the swivel bolt the eutters will be brought into cutting relation. Releasing pressure on the actuating lever permits the cutters to be restored to their normal open position -due to the resiliency of the members of which they form a part. The operating cam can be swung about the swivel bolt and into the position shown in Fig. 7 where the cam lever rests fiat against the adjacent resilient member with the cam forming flanges projecting outwardly therefrom and serving to protect the end of the swivel bolt as shown in Fig. 7.   </p>
