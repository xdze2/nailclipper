                        <p>  To all whom it may concern.-   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be it known that I, CHAPEL S. CARTER,a citizen of the United States, residing at Ansonia, in the county of New Haven and State of Connecticut, have invented a new and useful Improvement in Finger-Nail Trimmers; and I do hereby declare the following, when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings and the numerals of reference marked thereon. to be a full, clear, and exact description of the same, and which said drawings constitute part of this specification, and represent, in   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 1. a plan view of one form which a plier-like finger-nail trimmer constructed in accordance with my invention may assume, the device being shown as closed; Fig. 2, a View thereof partly in side elevation and partly in longitudinal section, the device being shown as closed; Fig. 3, a detached view in inside elevation of the lever member having a finger extending outwardly from its handle end; Fig. 4:, a corresponding view of the other lever member showing the locking-slide applied to it; Fig. 5, a plan view of one of the modified forms which the device may assume; Fig. 6, a broken view thereof in longitudinal sec tion, showing the two lever members as locked together by a swinging lock.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   My invention relates to an improvement in finger-nail trimmers of the plier type, the object being to produce a cheap, compact, effective, and durable article.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   \Vith these ends in view my invention consists in a finger-nail trimmer having certain details of construction and combinations of parts as will be hereinafter described, and pointed out in the claims.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In carrying out my invention as shown in Figs. 1 to 4:, inclusive, I empl<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">oy two <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">struckup sheet-metal lever members 2 and 3</span></span>, respectively, formed with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> cleara<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">nce-openings 4 and 5</span></span>, adapting the two members to be combined plierwise and pivotally, connected by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> pivot 6</span>, located relatively near their<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">g edges 7 and 8</span></span>. These lever members are flat in general form and cupped to increase their rigidity. For securing them together when not in use against the effort of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> spiral operating-spring 9</span> to open them, this spring being applied to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> pivot 6</span>, I form the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> member 2</span> at its free or handle end with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">rigid integral outwardly-extending finger 10</span>, having the twofold function of a nail-cleaner and a locking-lug. This<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> finger 10</span> is engaged by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> rounded hook 11</span>, located upon the free or handle end of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> locking-slide 12</span>, bowed to constitute a friction-spring and confined within the inner face of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> lever member 3</span> by means of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13"> clip 13</span>. The friction developed by bowing the slide is sufficient to hold it in place. To open the device the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> hook 11</span> is grasped between the thumb and forefinger and pulled outward, so as to disengage it from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> finger 10</span> and permit the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> spring 9</span> to act to separate the two levers. On the other hand, to close the device preparatory to returning it to the pocket, for instance, the two levers are pinched together between the thumb and forefinger until the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> finger 10</span> is brought within the range of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> hook 11</span>, which is then shoved inward over it, as shown by Fig. 2.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the modified construction shown by Figs. 5 and 6 the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> locking-slide 12</span> is replaced by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> swinging lock 14</span>:, formed at its outer end with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> rounded hook 15</span>, engaging with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> tapering locking-finger 16</span>, answering also as a nailcleaner. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> swinging lock 14</span> swings on a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> pivot-pin 17</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> lever member 18</span>, under the control of the tension of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> spring 19</span> in the form of a cupped disk. In operating this form of device the hook is swung away from and over the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> finger 16</span>. I   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having fully described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is   </p>
                    
                        <p>   1. In afinger-nail trimmer, the combination with two lever members pivoted together plierwise, one being provided upon its free or handle end with a rigid outwardly-extending locking-finger; of a movable fastening device applied to the other lever member for engagement with the said finger.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2. In afinger-nztiltrimmer, the combination with two lever members pivoted together plierwise, one being provided at its handle end with an outwardly-extending lockingfinger; of a slide applied to the inner face of the other lever member and formed with a hook for engagement with the said lockingfinger.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   3. Inafinger-nail trimmer, the combination with two lever members pivoted together plierwise, one being provided at its handle end with an outwardly-extending combined i specification in the presence of two subscribloeking-lug and nail-cleaner; of aslide applied ing Witnesses. to the inner face of the other lever member and adapted to engage With the said combined part for locking the two lever members in Witnesses: their closed positions.
