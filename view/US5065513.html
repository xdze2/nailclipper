                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> An artificial fingernail clipper is provided which includes a stationary nail holder with an aperture therein for receiving the fingernail, a cutting blade slidably disposed against and above the nail holder, and a blade mounting member which extends past the cutting blade and secured in the nail holder. An operating handle is disposed rearwardly of the cutting end having a pivotable member pivotally mounted with respect to and in direct contact with the cutting blade. The pivotable member thus causes the cutting blade to be slid forwardly to effect cutting of the nail. Pivoting of the pivotable member tends to exert an upward force on the rear end of the cutting blade, thereby ensuring that the forward edge of the cutting blade is in close contact with the nail holder, to ensure a clean cut. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates generally to fingernail clippers and more particularly to clippers for artificial fingernails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Artificial nails can be attached to natural fingernails to provide the appearance of long natural fingernails. Artificial nails are typically composed of elongate plastic material having a crescent-shaped cross section similar to a natural nail but much thicker. Artificial nails are thus far less likely to split or break. To mount artificial nails in place, they are first attached to the natural nail and then clipped to a desired length with a series of lateral cuts across the nail to form a rough outline of the desired curvature. The roughened edge is then filed to a smooth, continuous curvature, and is then buffed. In the filing and buffing step, plastic dust is introduced into the work area. This dust can adhere to any previously applied but wet fingernail polish, and thus can complicate the preparation process.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To overcome some of the problems inherent in the above-described process, I developed a single cut clipper for artificial nails, and was granted U.S. Pat. No. 4,856,190. That patent describes a nail clipper having a nail holder with a crescent-shaped aperture to receive an artificial fingernail, and has a straight edged blade slidably mounted in face-to-face relation to the nail holder. As the blade of the clipper is actuated, its edge is driven across the aperture to sever the artificial nail and form with one stroke a cut of desired continuous curvature controlled by suitable orientation of the clipper as the nail is clipped.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      While my previously patented single cut clipper has been successful and has been widely adopted by artificial fingernail users, the design of this earlier clipper is somewhat complicated and is therefore more expensive than perhaps desirable. Another potential drawback with my prior clipper is that it includes a link which exerts a forward and downward force o the cutting blade as the blade is actuated. This downward force presses the rear end of the blade against the nail holder, and may tend to cause the cutting blade to slightly tilt away from the nail holder at the cutting edge of the blade, thereby presenting the possibility of a less-than-precise cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a fingernail clipper which overcomes the drawbacks and limitations of the prior art proposals. More specifically, the invention has as its objects the following: (1) to develop a fingernail clipper which is more simple and therefore less expensive than clippers now available; (2) to provide a clipper having a blade which is activated in a motion which increases the accuracy or effectiveness of the cut; (3) the provision of a reciprocating blade fingernail clipper requiring a minimum of linkage to slide the blade; (4) to provide a clipper which clips an artificial nail to its final shape with a single cut and with selective curvature to thereby minimize the filing required and plastic dust generated during the cutting process; (5) to develop a fingernail clipper in which one of the handles directly engages the blade to produce a reciprocating action by the blade; and (6) to develop a reciprocating blade fingernail clipper in which the blade may be easily removed for repair or replacement.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The objects of the invention are achieved by the provision of a fingernail clipper which includes a cutting end having a stationary nail holder with an aperture therein for receiving a fingernail, a cutting blade slidably disposed against and above the nail holder, and a blade mounting member which extends past the cutting blade and is secured to the nail holder. Also included is an operating handle disposed rearwardly of the cutting end having a pivotable member pivotally mounted with respect to and in direct contact with the cutting blade to cause the cutting blade to extend to effect cutting of the nail, such that pivoting of the pivotable member tends to exert an upward force on the rear end of the cutting blade, causing a downward pressure by the cutting edge against the nail holder. In a preferred embodiment, the disposition of the pivotable member is such that the upward force increases as the pivoting of the pivotable member and the extension of the cutting blade continue. This causes a clean cut to be effected in any nail which is positioned within the nail holder aperture.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      After repeated use of the clipper, the cutting edge of the blade may become dull and require repair or replacement. In one embodiment of the present invention, the nail holder is detachably mounted and by pivoting the pivotable member to a fully pivoted position the cutting blade may be removed from the clipper once the blade mounting member is removed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more fully apparent as the description which follows is read in conjunction with the drawings.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A preferred embodiment of the present invention has been depicted in the drawings and is generally indicated at 10. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> depicted fingernail clipper 10</span> can be used for natural fingernails, but is particularly adapted to be used with artificial nails. It includes an operating mechanism having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> stationary member or handle 12</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> pivotable member or handle 14</span> which is pivotally mounted to the stationary handle at a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> pivot joint 16</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> stationary handle 12</span> extends rearwardly from a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cutting end 18</span> of the clipper and includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> pivot bracket 20</span> to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> which pivot joint 16</span> is mounted. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> pivotable handle 14</span> includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> first portion 22</span> which extends away from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> cutting end 18</span>, and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> second portion 24</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> pivot joint 16</span> is disposed between these two portions of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> pivotable handle 14</span>. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> cover plate 26</span> (see FIG. 1) is mounted over the forward end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> stationary handle 12</span> adjacent the two sides of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> pivot bracket 20</span>. The forward end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> stationary handle 12</span> includes an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> integral blade mounting plate 28</span> which, in combination with the underside of the stationary handle and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> dimple-ridge 30</span> therein, defines a rectangular blade mounting channel.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Disposed within the blade mounting channel is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> generally planar cutting blade 32</span> having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> rear end 34</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> cutting end or edge 36</span>. The cutting edge is sharpened by beveling and is typically a straight edge extending normal to the direction of reciprocation of the cutting blade. As shown best in FIG. 5, all but the portion of the cutting blade adjacent the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> cutting edge 36</span> fits within the blade mounting channel. The fit of the cutting blade within the blade mounting channel is such that the cutting blade can slide therein. The cutting blade also includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37"> longitudinally extending slot 37</span>, as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> rear end 34</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> cutting blade 32</span> is engaged by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> the downwardly extending second portion 24</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> pivotable handle 14</span>, as shown best in FIGS. 3 and 5.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In the depicted embodiment, the second portion of the pivotable handle includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> notch 38</span> which engages a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> laterally extending portion 40</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> rear end 34</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> cutting blade 32</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> notch 38</span> provides a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> pulling edge 42</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> pushing edge 44</span> which are designed to pull and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> push cutting blade 32</span>, respectively. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> biasing spring 46</span> extends from a rearward portion of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> stationary handle 12</span> at 48 and is mounted to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> pivotable handle 14</span> at an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> aperture 50</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> second portion 24</span> thereof. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> rearward end 52</span> (see FIG. 3) of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> second portion 24</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> pivotable handle 14</span> is designed to contact the underside of the stationary handle at 54 so that<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> biasing spring 46</span> holds the pivotable handle against the stationary handle at this point.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Also mounted to the cutting end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> clipper 10</span> is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> stationary nail holder 56</span> which has an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57"> upper surface 57</span>. The nail holder includes a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> rear portion 58</span> disposed within the blade mounting channel, and an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> enlarged forward portion 60</span> which extends forwardly beyond the blade mounting channel. A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> crescent-shaped aperture 62</span> is defined within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> enlarged portion 60</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> nail holder 56</span> and is designed to receive the artificial fingernail (not shown) which is to be cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> screw 64</span> having a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> downwardly extending shoulder 66</span> extends through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> blade mounting plate 28</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37"> slot 37</span> in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> cutting blade 32</span>, and is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> threaded into nail holder 56</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> Screw 64</span> thus maintains the position of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> nail holder 56</span> while providing a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> reciprocation channel 68</span> through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> which cutting blade 32</span> is designed to slide.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Operation of the Depicted Embodiment  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To use the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> depicted clipper 10</span>, the user extends her fingernail through the underside of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> aperture 62</span> in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> nail holder 56</span>. The nail may be positioned to effect the desired cut angulation as described and depicted in my aforementioned patent. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> pivotable handle 14</span> is then pressed downward in a cutting direction toward the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> stationary handle 12</span> against the biasing of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> spring 46</span> to cut the nail. Cutting is effected as the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> pushing edge 44</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> second portion 24</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> pivotable handle 14</span> pushes against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> laterally extending portion 40</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> rear end 34</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> cutting blade 32</span> to cause the cutting blade to slide forwardly in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> reciprocation channel 68</span> so that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> cutting edge 36</span> slices through the fingernail disposed in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> aperture 62</span>. Because the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> second portion 24</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> pivotable handle 14</span> is disposed generally perpendicular to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> cutting blade 32</span> as depicted in FIG. 3 in its resting position, and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> because pivot joint 16</span> is disposed above the cutting blade, actuation of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> pivotable handle 14</span> in a counterclockwise direction tends to exert upward pressure on the rear end of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> cutting blade 32</span> as it is being forwardly pushed through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> reciprocation channel 68</span>. This upward pressure on the rear end of the cutting blade increases as pivoting continues and as the angulation between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> pushing edge 44</span> and the rear end of the cutting blade increases. This pressure tends to cause the cutting blade to tilt slightly forwardly and downwardly, thereby ensuring that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> cutting end 36</span> is tightly pressed against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> nail holder 56</span> as cutting is being effected. This results in a very clean cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      After the cut has been effected, the user can relax her hand, and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> biasing spring 46</span> will cause retraction of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> second portion 24</span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> pivotable handle 14</span> which results in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> pulling edge 42</span> pulling against the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> laterally extending portion 40</span> of the cutting blade to cause retraction thereof back to the initial at rest position depicted in FIG. 3.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> cutting blade 32</span> may be removed from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> clipper 10</span> for replacement or repair by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> withdrawing screw 64</span>. This<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> permits cutting blade 32</span> to be slid forwardly out of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> clipper once pivotable handle 14</span> is in its fully pivoted position (not shown). The blade may be replaced by merely sliding it back into the clipper, permitting the biasing spring to bias the pivotable handle to its original position, and then replacing the screw. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> shoulder 66</span> in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> screw <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">64</span> prevents nail holder 56</span> from being tightened further than is desirable.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The depicted embodiment thus provides clipper which is easy to use, which is simple in construction and therefore inexpensive to fabricate, and yet which permits a clean cut to be effected every time it is used. Blade replacement is easy and can be done by the user with little or no instruction.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Although a preferred embodiment of the invention has been disclosed, it should be appreciated that variations and modifications ma be made thereto without departing from the scope of the invention, as defined in the appended claims. </p>
