                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> Tools, such as nail clippers, include at least one lever pivotally movable towards and away from another portion of the tools. Yieldable gripping pads of elastomeric material such as rubber, yieldable plastic or the like are disposed on facing surfaces of the lever. The facing pads are usable for clamping about the screw on top of a bottle of nail polish inserted between the pads allowing twisting off of the top by counter-clockwise rotation of the tool relative to the nail polish bottle. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0002]    This invention relates generally to a tool for twisting off the screw caps of containers, such as nail polish bottles, and more particularly to a nail care implement such as a nail clipper which includes a tool for twisting off the screw top on a bottle of nail polish.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    2. Description of Related Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]    Screw cap removers as well as nail clippers are known in the prior art. More specifically by way of example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,509,784 to Vollers discloses a split ring having a cap gripping inner surface about a central aperture adapted to receive a bottle cap, and a pair of handles attached to said ring and extending in generally the same direction away from said ring, said handles being manually graspable and movable relatively toward one another to draw said ring surface into forcible gripping engagement with the cap, whereby the handles may then be rotated to rotate and loosen the cap.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    U.S. Pat. No. 2,641,943 to Krize, Jr. discloses a bottle screw cap remover which may be employed with a wide range of different sizes of bottle screw caps.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]    The device may be employed to remove a wide range of different sizes of screw caps, since the conical configuration of the recess allows the device to be placed over any screw cap which may be received in recess. It is shaped in the form of a human figure having a flat bottom with conical recess opening having straight saw blades secured in its wall forming the gripping elements when the body is placed over a cap to be removed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    U.S. Pat. No. 3,583,263 to Herigstad relates to a cap remover particularly effective for removing screw-threaded caps from containers such as beer and soda pop bottles. The screw cap remover has a plastic body with a disc-shaped handle element and an opening for receiving a cup-shaped rubber gripping element. The sides of the cup-shaped rubber element are secured to the body. A spring is positioned between the body and the top wall of the gripping element to form a dimple to eject the cap after it is removed from a bottle.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    U.S. Pat. No. 7,367,248 to Ruffner discloses a screw top opener with two handles which can be pivoted. A first clamping jaw is formed on the first handle and a second clamping jaw is formed on the second handle. A screw top can be grasped by the two clamping jaws. A distance between the clamping jaws can be reduced by pivoting the two handles against each other. In accordance with this invention, a first clamping jaw is embodied on a straightedge, which can be pushed into the first handle and can be arrested in a multitude of positions with respect to the first handle. Thus, it is possible to achieve a short linear extension of the screw top opener without foregoing the comfort of being able to also grasp and open large screw tops.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    U.S. Pat. No. 3,760,657 to Muir, et al, discloses a cap removing device consisting of a base member made of thermo-plastic material, and having a teat-drop shape opening, with one side having in part, a convex curve, and the other side having a concave curve. A metallic strip member is embedded in the thermo-plastic material along-side the convex side with one edge of the metallic strip member exposed and extending into the opening, there being saw-toothed formations along the exposed edge.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    U.S. Pat. No. 4,341,015 to Young discloses a clipper assembly for clipping nails, including a nail clipper with a flexible housing attached to the nail clipper for collecting nail clippings during and after operation.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    U.S. Pat. No. 4,017,923 to Schantz discloses a finger nail retainer and tweezer for use with a conventional nail clipper. The retainer and tweezer is used with a conventional nail clipper having a pair of elongated cutting blades fastened together at a rear end and having cutting blades at a forward end. The retainer and tweezer is made of spring steel and is of a generally V-shaped construction fitting over the pair of cutting blades and covering the space therebetween to retain nail clippings. The retainer and tweezer when removed from the nail clipper can be squeezed together and serve a particularly advantageous function as a tweezer  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>

                        <p>      DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0022]    Twisting off caps from containers can be quite difficult. This is particularly the case with small containers such as nail polish bottles where the bottle cap is generally of such small size as to make it difficult to grasp. Also, the nail polish within the bottle can harden on the screw threads tending to cement the cap to the bottle.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0023]    Tools for forcibly twisting off bottle caps are known, of course, but an object of the present invention is to avoid the need for a separate tool by adding a nail polish bottle cap twist off capability to known nail clippers. The tool includes one or more elongated levers pivoted for rotation about a fulcrum towards and away from another portion of the tool. In accordance with this invention, modifications of the lever portions of the tool are made by adding a cap twist off capability to the tool.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0024]    There is disclosed a multifunctional tool which serves as a nail clipper, and screw cap twist off remover for small bottles such as nail polish containers. The tool includes one or more elongated levers pivoted for rotation about a fulcrum towards and away from another portion of the tool.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0025]    Referring to  FIG. 1 , there is shown a side elevation of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">nail clipper  8</span>  in accordance with this invention. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">clipper  8</span>  includes first and second overlapped <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">and coextensive elongated metal members  10</span>  and  12  joined at <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">first ends  14</span>  of the members and shaped to d<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">iverge towards spaced apart second ends  16</span>  thereof. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">second ends  16</span>  are bent towards one another and include <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">facing cutting edges  18</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">pin  20</span> , held in place by means of an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">enlarged collar  22</span> , extends between the two members slightly rearward of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">cutting edge  18</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">pin  20</span>  extends through and beyond the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">second member  12</span>  and is engaged by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">lever  24</span>  including an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">enlarged portion  26</span>  forming a fulcrum about which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">lever  24</span>  can be pivoted.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0026]    Movement of the free end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">lever  <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">24</span>  towards member  12</span>  causes rotation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">fulcrum  26</span>  against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">second metal member  12</span>  which drives the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">second end  16</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">member  12</span>  towards the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">first member  10</span>  to close the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">cutting edges  18</span>  of the two members against one another.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]    To the extent described, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">nail clipper  8</span>  is of known type and has no capability for twisting the top off a bottle of nail polish. Such capability is now provided according to the present invention, by the addition of a yieldable gripping material such as <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">pads or sleeves  30</span>  of an elastomeric material such as, for example, rubber, a yieldable plastic, etc. which can have a surface that is rough or smooth and, in another embodiment where a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">pad or sleeve  30</span>  is located on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">one facing surfaces  32</span>  (on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">lever  24</span> ) and serrations or transverse ridges are located on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">facing surface  34</span>  (on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">metal strip  12</span> ). Accordingly, by inserting a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cap  36</span>  of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">nail polish bottle  38</span>  in the space between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">two pads  30</span> , and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">pressing lever  24</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">second metal member  12</span>  against the cap, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cap  36</span>  on the bottle of nail polish is firmly clamped between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">rubber pads  30</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">lever  24</span>  and on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">member  12</span>  of the nail clipper. With the nail clipper tool now clamped about the bottle cap, counter-clockwise rotation of the entire tool relative to the bottle while holding the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">lever  24</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">second metal member  12</span>  clamped against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cap  36</span>  applies a twist off force to the cap.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]    Referring to  FIG. 1 , a hollow cylinder of yieldable gripping material can be telescoped onto one or both of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">lever  24</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">overlapped metal members  10</span>  and  12 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0029]    Referring to  FIG. 2 , there is shown a perspective view of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">conventional nail polish bottle  38</span>  having a cylindrical screw on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">top  36</span> . The side of the cap may have a smooth surface or a surface that has <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">vertical serrations or ridges  37</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0030]    Looking at  FIG. 3 , there is shown a perspective view of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">another conventional nail polish bottle  38</span>  having a conical shaped screw on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">top  36</span> . The side of the cap may have a smooth surface or a surface that has <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">vertical serrations or ridges  37</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0031]    Referring to  FIG. 4 , there is shown a perspective view of the nail clipper in its operation position in accordance with the principles of the invention positioned to twist the top off a bottle of nail polish.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0032]    In accordance with this invention, because gripping material on the handles are of a yieldable material, either cylindrical or conical screw on tops of nail polish bottles can be gripped and twisted off the top of the bottles.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0033]    In another embodiment of the invention, the pads can comprise separate layers of yieldable gripping material, or the like, cemented in place.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0034]    Referring to  FIG. 5 , there is shown another embodiment of the invention which utilizes a known type of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">scissors  40</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">Such known scissors comprise two arms  42</span>  mutually rotatable about a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">pin  44</span>  joining the two arms. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">Portions  46</span>  of the arms forward of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">pin  44</span>  are cutting blades of the scissors, and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">arm portions  48</span>  rearward of the pin are the scissor handles. In accordance with the principles of this invention, facing, oppositely disposed surfaces of the handles are provided with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">elastomeric pads  50</span>  such as, for example, rubber. When the handles are moved apart, a gap; between the two pads is opened into which a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cap  36</span>  on a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">bottle  38</span> , see  FIG. 3  or  FIG. 4 , can be inserted to be clamped by squeezing the handles together. The scissors is then rotated counter clockwise while holding the bottle steady to unscrew the cap from the bottle.  </p>
