                        <p>   This invention relates to cutlery </span>and has for its object to provide a combined cuticle pusher and nippers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another db ject of the invention is to provide a manicuring device comprising a pair of lever actuated cuticle pushers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A further object of the invention is to provide a combination lever operated pair of nippers and cuticle pushers.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A still further object of my invention is to provide a combined nipper and cuticle pusher operated by scissor action.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Other features and advantages will become more readily apparent from the following description and the accompanying illustrative drawings in which:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 1 is a plan view of one form of my invention,   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 2 is an enlarged view similar to Figure 1, showing the device in operative position,   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 3 is a view similar to Figure 1, illustrating a modification, and   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Figure 4 is another plan view showing a still further modification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the accompanying drawings as above enumerated and in the following specification, like characters of reference indicate like parts throughout and in which [0, indicates my manicuring implement, which comprises a pair of cuticle pushers H and I2, the two forming the approximate shape of the inner portion of a fingernail and each of which is secured to the ends l3 and M, of shanks I5 and I6, spread apart at I! and I8, and plvotally connected together at I9. From the point IS, the shanks flare away from one another as at 20 and 2|, terminating in rings &#39;22 and 23. The outer edges 24 and 25, of the members II and I<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">2, form<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> nippers for re</span></span>moving small pieces of cuticle. In operation, the manicurist engages the rings 22 and 23, with her fingers and places t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">he bott<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">om edges </span></span>26 and 21, against the cuticle of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> the fi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">ngernail and spr</span></span>eads said rings apart, whereby said edges will spread away from one another, shoving the cuticle of the nail downwardly and outwardly. The members II and I2, are segmental and somewhat concave in form as indicated in Figure 2.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In Figure 3, I show a modification of the invention wherein the straight shanks 28 and 29, do not cross one an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">other a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">t the pivotal point</span></span> as at 3|). The outer ends of these shanks form nippers 3| and 32, and the edges 3<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">3 and 34, form the cut</span>icle pushers and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">the rin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">gs 35 and</span></span> 36 spread apart when the edges 31<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> and 32<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">, are in </span></span>contact, In this case <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">the rin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">gs 35 and</span></span> 36, must be drawn together to spr<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">ead the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> pusher e</span></span>dges 33 and 34,   </p>

                        <p>   It is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> thought that persons skille</span>d in the art to which the invention relates will be able to obtain a clear understanding of the invention after considering the description in connection with the drawings. Therefore, a more lengthly description is regarded as unnecessary.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Minor changes in shape, size and rearrangement of details and parts such as come within the purview of the invention claimed may be resorted to, in actual practice, if desired.   </p>

                        <p>   1. In a manicure instrument a pair of scissor action levers, a finger receiving ring at one end of each lever, a cuticle pushing jaw on each of the opposite ends of the levers, said jaws lying in opposed relation and being movable toward or away from one another in the same plane, a curved outer edge on each jaw to engage and push back the cuticle on the finger of the user, each J&#39;aw being relieved along its inner edge and cutting edges at the extreme outer ends of the jaws forming nippers for clipping loosened cuticle.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2. In a manicure instrument, a pair of shanks having cooperative cuticle pushing jaws mounted upon the front ends thereof and being connected at their rear ends, the jaws lying in opposed relation and being movable toward and away from one another in the same plane, a curved outer edge on each jaw to engage and push back the cuticle on the finger of the user, each jaw being relieved along its inner edge, and cutting edges at the extrme outer ends of the jaws forming nippers for clipping loosened cuticle.   </p>
