                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A pedicure kit comprises a toe spreader and a toe nail scissor that separates toes of a foot of a user who has difficulty bending without the user having to bend and cuts the toe nails on the toes of the foot of the user who has difficulty bending without the user having to bend. The combination includes an elongated and slender toe spreader, and an elongated and slender toe nail scissor. The elongated and slender toe spreader has a slender handle portion that is releasibly engagable in the palm of a hand of the user, and a toe spreader portion that is remote from the slender handle portion of the elongated and slender toe spreader and releasibly engages and separates the toes of the foot of the user from each other without the user having to bend, so that the toes of the foot of the user who has difficulty bending can be separated from each other without the user having to bend and separate the toes of the foot of the user with another hand of the user. And, the elongated and slender toe nail scissor is separate from the elongated and slender toe spreader and has a handle portion that is releasibly engagable by the thumb and the index finger of another hand of the user, and a cutting portion that is remote from the handle portion of the elongated and slender toe nail scissor and cuts the toe nails on the toes of the foot of the user without the user having to bend, so that the toe nails on the toes of the foot of the user who has difficulty bending can be cut without the user having to bend. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates to a combination toe spreader and toe nail scissor. More particularly, the present invention relates to a combination toe spreader and toe nail scissor that separates toes of a foot of a user who has difficulty bending without the user having to bend and cuts the toe nails on the toes of the foot of the user who has difficulty bending without the user having to bend. The combination includes an elongated and slender toe spreader, and an elongated and slender toe nail scissor. The elongated and slender toe spreader has a slender handle portion that is releasibly engagable in the palm of a hand of the user, and a toe spreader portion that is remote from the slender handle portion of the elongated and slender toe spreader and releasibly engages and separates the toes of the foot of the user from each other without the user having to bend, so that the toes of the foot of the user who has difficulty bending can be separated from each other without the user having to bend and separate the toes of the foot of the user with another hand of the user. And, the elongated and slender toe nail scissor is separate from the elongated and slender toe spreader and has a handle portion that is releasibly engagable by the thumb and the index finger of another hand of the user, and a cutting portion that is remote from the handle portion of the elongated and slender toe nail scissor and cuts the toe nails on the toes of the foot of the user without the user having to bend, so that the toe nails on the toes of the foot of the user who has difficulty bending can be cut without the user having to bend.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Many older individuals, overweight individuals, and physically disabled individuals have extreme difficulty in trimming their toe nails with conventional forms of toe nail clippers. In fact, many individuals find it entirely impossible to trim their toe nails with these conventional devices and are forced to seek assistance in trimming their toe nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Numerous innovations for toe nail clipping assisting devices have been provided in the prior art that will be described. Even though these innovations may be suitable for the specific individual purposes to which they address, however, they differ from the present invention in that they do not teach a combination toe spreader and toe nail scissor that separates toes of a foot of a user who has difficulty bending without the user having to bend and cuts the toe nails on the toes of the foot of the user who has difficulty bending without the user having to bend. The combination includes an elongated and slender toe spreader, and an elongated and slender toe nail scissor. The elongated and slender toe spreader has a slender handle portion that is releasibly engagable in the palm of a hand of the user, and a toe spreader portion that is remote from the slender handle portion of the elongated and slender toe spreader and releasibly engages and separates the toes of the foot of the user from each other without the user having to bend, so that the toes of the foot of the user who has difficulty bending can be separated from each other without the user having to bend and separate the toes of the foot of the user with another hand of the user. And, the elongated and slender toe nail scissor is separate from the elongated and slender toe spreader and has a handle portion that is releasibly engagable by the thumb and the index finger of another hand of the user, and a cutting portion that is remote from the handle portion of the elongated and slender toe nail scissor and cuts the toe nails on the toes of the foot of the user without the user having to bend, so that the toe nails on the toes of the foot of the user who has difficulty bending can be cut without the user having to bend.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,847,994 to Dunn, Jr. teaches a remotely actuated toe nail clipper that includes a cylindrical tubular housing which encloses an axially reciprocating plunger rod. A leaf spring type toe nail clipper extends through a slot in a bottom portion of the housing. An actuating lever of the toe nail clipper is in engagement with the plunger rod. A scissor mechanism extends transversely through a slot in an upper portion of the housing for actuating the plunger rod. The device is particularly designed for use by individuals who have difficulty reaching their toe nails with conventional forms of nail clippers. In a second embodiment, the axially movable plunger rod is electrically actuated by a solenoid mechanism. An adjustable telescope is mounted in parallel relation to the cylindrical housing and provides an individual with a clear view of the toe nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Another example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,893,406 to Larson teaches an extension apparatus in combination with a conventional nail clipping device. The extension apparatus comprises an elongated extension member and a remote actuating unit which are operatively connected to the conventional nail clipping device. The extension member is further provided with a visual inspection member and a support member.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Finally, still another example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,357,677 to West teaches a toe nail clipper apparatus that has a nail clipper connected on one end of an elongated member and a pistol-type grip mounted on the other end. A cord attached to the nail clipper and a trigger adjacent to the handle actuates the clipper. The elongated member may have a pivotal joint near the clipper end of the elongated member to permit moving the clipper in an arc.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is apparent that numerous innovations for toe nail clipping assisting devices have been provided in the prior art that are adapted to be used. Furthermore, even though these innovations may be suitable for the specific individual purposes to which they address, however, they would not be suitable for the purposes of the present invention as heretofore described.  </p>
