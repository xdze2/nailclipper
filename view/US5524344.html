                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates to a safety grip and more particularly pertains to such a grip specifically adapted for use in conjunction with a pair of nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Description of the Prior Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The use of nail clippers is known in the prior art. More specifically, nail clippers heretofore devised and utilized for the purpose of personal grooming are known to consist basically of familiar, expected, and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which has been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 5,101,563 to d&#39;Orgelys, U.S. Pat. No. 4,602,430 to Allen, Jr., U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,449 to Lee et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,063,666 to Tsay, U.S. Pat. No. 4,819,673 to McMullen, Jr. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,640,011 to Gamble all disclose nail clipper constructions.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In this respect, the a safety grip according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in doing so provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of providing increased gripping on a pair of nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Therefore, it can be appreciated that there exists a continuing need for a new and improved safety grip which can be used in conjunction with nail clippers. In this regard, the present invention substantially fulfills this need.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of nail clippers now present in the prior art, the present invention provides an improved safety grip. As such, the general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new and improved a safety grip and method which has all the advantages of the prior art and none of the disadvantages.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To attain this the present invention provides a pair of clippers which are constructed from an upper clipper with a first end and a second cutting end, and a lower clipper with a first end and a second cutting end. The first end of the upper clipper is connected to the first end of the lower clipper. This connection can be achieved in various ways known in the art. The connection, however, should be such as to allow the upper and lower clippers to be resiliently urged towards one another. The second cutting end of the upper clipper is adapted for cooperation with the second cutting end of the lower clipper. It is the interaction between the cutting ends of the upper and lower clippers which facilitates the cutting of a user&#39;s finger or toe nails. The upper and lower clippers extend away from one another from first towards the second end. The connection at the first ends of the clippers, as well as the material from which the clippers are constructed, enables the second ends of the clippers to be resiliently urged towards one another. With respect to materials, all of the components described herein, with the exception of the elastomeric sleeve, are constructed from a stainless steel. However, it is envisioned that other stain-resistant metals could suffice. An aperture is formed within the upper clipper approximate its second end, and an aperture is formed within the lower clipper approximate its second end. The function of these apertures will be described hereinafter. The ability of the upper and lower clippers to be urged together is achieved, in part, through a post. The post has a lower end and an upper end. The post is positioned within the aperture of the upper clipper and within the aperture of the lower clipper. Thus, the post serves in part to interconnect the upper and lower clippers as well as in aiding proper alignment between the clippers when they are urged together. The urging of the clippers is achieved through a clipper lever. The clipper lever has a first end, and a forked second end. The forked second end of the clipper is pivotally secured to the upper end of the post. The clipper lever has a first orientation wherein the lever extends upwardly from the upper clipper, and a second wherein the clipper lever is pivoted towards the upper clipper. When the clipper lever is pivoted towards the upper clipper the upper clipper is urged towards the lower clipper and the cutting end of the upper clipper and the cutting end of the lower clipper come into engagment with one another. Thus, when an operator wishes to cut something the clipper lever is urged towards the upper clipper. This in turn brings the cutting ends of the two clippers together. An elastomeric sleeve is utilized in order for the operator to get a good grip upon the clipper lever. The elastomeric sleeve has a first closed end, a second opened end, a lower smooth surface, an upper surface and two sides. The two sides diverge outwardly from the opened second end towards the first closed end. This diverging of the two sides of the sleeve enables the surface area of the sleeve to increase towards the closed end of the sleeve. The user employs more pressure at the first end of the lever, consequently the sleeve provides more surface area for contact at this first end. Furthermore, the first closed end is defined by a three sides. As illustrated in the figures, at the end of the two diverging sides, there are three more sides which define the first closed end. Two of the sides of the closed end diverge inwardly with respect to the two outwardly diverging sides. The upper surface includes a plurality of upstanding cylindrical gripping elements. These These cylindrical gripping elements are molded integrally with the rest of the sleeve and function in providing increased gripping for the user. The elastomeric sleeve is adapted to be frictionally fit over the first end of the clipper lever. Thus, the opened second end of the sleeve leads into a cavity. The cavity is dimensioned to frictionally receive the clipper lever. The entire sleeve is integrally molded from a suitable elastomeric material such as rubber. However, it is envisioned that the sleeve could be made from a polymer such as vinyl.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.

                        <p>      With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to FIG. 1 thereof, the preferred embodiment of the new and improved safety grip embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be described.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates to a pair of fingernail clippers with an associated grip portion. In its broadest context, the present invention includes a pair of fingernail clippers having an upper clipper, a lower clipper and a clipper lever which is employed in bringing the upper and lower clippers into engagement with one another. Furthermore, the present invention includes an elastomeric grip having a first closed end, and a second opened end. The grip is adapted to be frictionally fit over the end of the clipper lever. The various components of the present invention, and the manner in which they interrelate, will be described in greater detail hereinafter.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> clippers 20</span> are constructed from an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> upper clipper 22</span> with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> first end 24</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> second cutting end 26</span>, and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> lower clipper 28</span> with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> first end 30</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> second cutting end 32</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> first end 24</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> upper clipper 22</span> being connected to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> first end 30</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> lower clipper 28</span>. This connection can be achieved in various way known in the art. The connection, however, should be such as to allow the upper and lower clippers to be resiliently urged towards one another. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> second cutting end 26</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> upper clipper 22</span> is adapted for cooperation with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> second cutting end 32</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> lower clipper 28</span>. It is the interaction between the cutting ends of the upper and lower clippers which facilitates the cutting of a user&#39;s finger or toe nails. The upper and lower clippers extend away from one another from first towards the second end. The connection at the first ends of the clippers, as well as the material from which the clippers are constructed, enables the second ends of the clippers to be resiliently urged towards one another. With respect to materials, all of the components described herein, with the exception of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> elastomeric sleeve 42</span>, are constructed from a stainless steel. However, it is envisioned that other stain-resistant metals could suffice. An aperture is formed within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> upper clipper 22</span> approximate its second end, and an aperture is formed within the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> lower clipper 28</span> approximate its second end. The function of these apertures will be described hereinafter.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The ability of the upper and lower clippers to be urged together is achieved, in part, through a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> post 34</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> post 34</span> has a lower end and an upper end. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> post 34</span> is positioned within the aperture of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> upper clipper 22</span> and within the aperture of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> lower clipper 28</span>. Thus, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> post 34</span> serves in part to interconnect the upper and lower clippers as well as in aiding proper alignment between the clippers when they are urged together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The urging of the clippers is achieved through a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> clipper lever 36</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> clipper lever 36</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> first end 38</span>, and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> forked second end 40</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> forked second end 40</span> of the clipper is pivotally secured to the upper end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> post 34</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> clipper lever 36</span> has a first orientation wherein the lever extends upwardly from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> upper clipper 22</span>, and a second orientation wherein the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> clipper lever 36</span> is pivoted towards the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> upper clipper 22</span>. When the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> clipper lever 36</span> is pivoted towards the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> upper clipper 22</span> the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> upper clipper 22</span> is urged towards the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> lower clipper 28</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> cutting end 26</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> upper clipper 22</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> cutting end 32</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> lower clipper 28</span> come into engagment with one another. Thus, when an operator wishes to cut something the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> clipper lever 36</span> is urged towards the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> upper clipper 22</span>, this in turn brings the cutting ends of the two clippers together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      An<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> elastomeric sleeve 42</span> is utilized in order for the operator to get a good grip upon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> clipper lever 36</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> elastomeric sleeve 42</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> first closed end 44</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> second opened end 46</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> lower smooth surface 48</span>, an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> upper surface 50</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> two sides 52</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> two sides 52</span> diverge outwardly from the opened second end towards the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> first closed end 44</span>. This diverging of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> two sides 52</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> sleeve 42</span> enables the surface area of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> sleeve 42</span> to increase towards the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> closed end 44</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> sleeve 42</span>. The user employs more pressure at the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> first end 38</span> of the lever, consequently the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> sleeve 42</span> provides more surface area for contact at this<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> first end 38</span>. Furthermore, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> first closed end 44</span> is defined by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> three sides 54</span>. As illustrated in the Figures, at the end of the two diverging sides, there are three more sides which define the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> first closed end 44</span>. Two of the sides of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> closed end 44</span> diverge inwardly with respect to the two outwardly diverging sides.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> upper surface 50</span> includes a plurality of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> upstanding cylindrical gripping elements 56</span>. These<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> cylindrical gripping elements 56</span> are molded integrally with the rest of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> sleeve 42</span> and function in providing increased gripping for the user. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> elastomeric sleeve 42</span> is adapted to be frictionally fit over the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> first end 38</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> clipper lever 36</span>. Thus, the opened second of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> sleeve 42</span> leads into a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> cavity 58</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> cavity 58</span> is dimensioned to frictionally receive the clipper lever. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> entire sleeve 42</span> is integrally molded from a suitable elastomeric material such as rubber. However, it is envisioned that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> sleeve 42</span> could be made from a polymer such as vinyl.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As to the manner of usage and operation of the present invention, the same should be apparent from the above description. Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the manner of usage and operation will be provided.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention. </p>
