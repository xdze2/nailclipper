                        <p> A sport bag comprises first and second substantially identical soft sided generally rectangular parallelepiped compartments having an array of layers of hard sided boxes which may be maintained at various elevations with respect to the bottom side of the compartments in order to enhance access of the hard sided boxes. The compartments are hinged together along a bottom edge and are also connected by a gusset and/or connecting straps joined to a carry strap that may be pulled to pivot the compartments flush back to back. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]     In a principal aspect the present invention relates to a sport bag generally of the type used by fisherman, hunters, hobbyists and the like.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0002]     Practice of a sport or hobby often requires access to items associated with the sport or hobby. Fishermen typically desire access to lures, lines, weights, certain tools, and the like. Hobbyists, such as model airplane enthusiasts, may require batteries, fuel, repair kits, bonding materials, and the like. To satisfy such a need for such items, sportsmen and hobbyists often employ tackle boxesâ€”metal or molded plastic containers with internal compartments. Often such containers have inadequate capacity. Moreover, it may be difficult to access the contents of such containers. Also, to change the contents of such containers and clean such containers may be difficult and time consuming. Thus, sportsmen and hobbyists may desire alternative containers or options for their gear.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0003]     Briefly, the present invention comprises a sport bag fabricated from a soft material such as canvas or other fabric and including first and second generally rectangular, parallelepiped identical compartments hinged back to back and pivotal about their hinge connection between a flush back to back position and an open position. The compartments are connected by straps or gussets which may be attached to a shoulder strap that may be engaged to pivot the compartments together. The sport bag is sized to receive modular, removable, hard sided layers of boxes that hold sport gear or items and which may be supported on an array of stepped supports within the compartment to facilitate removal of the boxes from the compartment. The sport bag may also include various hand operated tools attached by a lanyard to a side or handle of the bag wherein the lanyard is extendable in length and wherein the tool may be retained in a pocket or by other means on the side of the bag when the tool is not in use.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]     Thus, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved sport bag.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]     A further object is to provide a sport bag inclusive of removable, hard sided, modular sized, storage boxes.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]     Another object of the invention is to provide an inexpensive and rugged sport bag.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]     Another object of the invention is to provide a sport bag with a shoulder strap that effects closure or compacting of elements comprising the bag.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]     A further object is to provide a sports bag with a tool attached thereto by an extensible lanyard.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]     These and other objects, advantages and features of the invention will be set forth in the detailed description which follows.   </p>

                        <p>      DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0031]     Referring to the figures, the sport bag of the invention is particularly useful to fishermen, hunters and other sports activists. The bag of  FIGS. 1-2  includes first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">second bag sections  8</span>  and  9 . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">Section  8</span>  comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">bottom side  10</span>  having an inside face, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">back side  12</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">front side  14</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">first lateral side  16</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">second lateral side  18</span> . A fold over <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">top side  20</span>  is also preferably included. The material used to make the bag sections is typically a fabric, canvas or plastic material. Thus, the bag is typically a collapsible soft sided bag and has a generally rectangular parallelepiped shape or configuration. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">second bag section or compartment  9</span>  is comprised of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">bottom side  11</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">back side  13</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">front side  15</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">first lateral side  17</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">second lateral side  19</span>  as well as a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">top flap  21</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">first section or compartment  8</span>  is substantially a mirror image of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">second section  9</span>  and thus the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">backsides thereof  12</span>  and  13  are placed in opposed relation, one to the other. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">separate sections or compartments  8</span>  and  9  are hinged to each other along a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">bottom hinge joint  30</span>  which is defined generally at the junction of the bottom sides, respectively,  10 ,  11  with the back sides, respectively,  12 ,  13 . Thus, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">separate sections  8</span>  and  9  may pivot one with respect to the other about the hinge junction or connection.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0032]     An important aspect of the invention is the inclusion of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">gusset  32</span>  connecting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">first lateral sides  18</span>  and  19  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">second gusset  34</span>  connecting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">second lateral sides  16</span>  and  17 . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">horizontal cross strap  36</span>  also connects the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lateral sides  18</span>  and  19 . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">horizontal similar strap  37</span>  is provided on the opposite side of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">sections  8</span> ,  9  for attachment to the outside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">second lateral sides  16</span> , and  17 . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">shoulder carry strap  40</span>  is attached to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">the two horizontal lateral side straps  36</span> ,  37  which are stitched in the embodiment shown to the outside edge, such as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">edge  35</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">outside edge  37</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">respective elements or bags  8</span>  and  9 . Thus, as shown in  FIG. 2  by pulling on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">carry strap  40</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">horizontal straps  36</span> ,  37  can be engaged and tightened causing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">bags  8</span>  and  9 , when being carried by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">shoulder strap  40</span> , to fold the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">gussets  32</span>  and  34  into a compact easily carried assembly of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">two sub-elements or sections  8</span>  and  9  to the configuration of  FIG. 2 . Note, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cross straps  36</span> ,  37  may serve as gussets to limit pivot movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">compartments  8</span> ,  9 . Also in the preferred embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">straps  36</span> ,  37  are sewn or attached at their opposite ends, for example, to the area of side panels adjacent the front sides to facilitate pivotal action of the compartments.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0033]     Referring next to  FIGS. 3-7 , an additional optional feature that can be incorporated with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">sections  8</span> ,  9  is disclosed. In this additional optional feature, a bag section or compartment, for example, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">section  8</span>  which is represented schematically in  FIG. 3 , is a soft sided element of the sport bag. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">section  8</span>  is designed to receive a series of two <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">or more hard sided containers or boxes  50</span> ,  52  and  54 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">boxes  50</span> ,  52  and  54  are hard sided boxes, for example, boxes formed from molded plastic. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">boxes  50</span> ,  52 ,  54  typically are designed to hold various gear such as fishing gear or the like. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">boxes  50</span> ,  52 , and  54  are sized in a modular fashion. Thus, the dimensional extent of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">boxes  50</span> ,  52 ,  54  from side to side will preferably be substantially equal to the distance between the lateral sides, for example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lateral side  16</span>  and  18  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">compartment  8</span> . The summation of the thickness of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">boxes  50</span> ,  52 , and  54  overlying each other in stacked array is substantially equal to the distance between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">back side  12</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">front side  14</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">compartment  8</span> . Thus, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">compartment section  8</span>  has a shape and configuration that is dictated by the combination of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">hard sided boxes  50</span> ,  52  and  54 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">boxes  50</span> ,  52  and  54  thus maintain the shape of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">soft sided bag  8</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0034]     A problem often encountered with respect to inclusion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">such hard sided boxes  50</span> ,  52 ,  54  within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">soft sided bag  8</span>  is the effort to effect removal of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">boxes  50</span> ,  52 ,  54  one at a time from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">compartment  8</span> .  FIGS. 4-7  depict solutions for maintaining the boxes at different elevations so that they can be easily accessed. Referring to  FIG. 4 , for example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">bag  8</span>  may include, within its interior, a series of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">molded steps  60</span>  and  62 . For example, a foam material may be inserted within the interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">bag  8</span>  having a configuration depicted in  FIG. 4  comprising a series of steps for support of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">boxes  50</span> ,  52  and  54 . Note, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">boxes  50</span> ,  52 ,  54  have substantially the same size and shape in the embodiment depicted. Thus, the top sides and a portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">boxes  50</span> ,  52 ,  54  project one above the other thereby facilitating access for removal and replacement.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0035]      FIG. 5  illustrates an alternative box support scheme wherein a web of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">material  64</span>  is provided between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">front side  14</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">back side  12</span>  with the web of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">material  64</span>  inclined upwardly between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">front side  14</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">back side  12</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0036]      FIG. 6  illustrates yet another alternative box support scheme wherein webbing extends laterally between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">sides  16</span>  and  18  and is provided at various levels. Thus, strands of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">webbing  66</span>  and  68  extend horizontally between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">sides  16</span>  and  18 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0037]      FIG. 7  illustrates yet another embodiment wherein strands or strips of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">webbing  70</span> ,  72  and  74  extend between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">front side  14</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">back side  12</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">soft sided container  8</span>  and are inclined upwardly as they extend from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">front side  14</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">back side  12</span> . Each of these embodiments in  FIGS. 4-7  provides a means by which boxes of various modular size, designed to fill the interior space of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">compartment  8</span> , can be arrayed so that they can be more easily accessible. Various other means may be provided to incline the array of the hard sided boxes within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">compartment  8</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">section or compartment  9</span>  may also include such an array of elements therein.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0038]     Other alternative constructions for the sport bag are within the scope of the invention. For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">compartment connecting gussets  32</span>  and  34  need not fill the entire space between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">back sides  12</span>  and  13  as illustrated in  FIG. 1 . The gussets may be elastic. The gussets may comprise straps connecting the top edges of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">each compartment  8</span> ,  9 . Other alternative connections may be effected to provide a means by which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">bag  8</span>  and  9  may be pivoted one with respect to the other   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0039]      FIGS. 8-20  illustrate various embodiments of sport bags, including a sport bag of the type of  FIGS. 1-7 , which may incorporate the feature of providing a tool on an extensible lanyard or connection cord. The lanyard or connection cord is thus affixed generally at one end to the outside face of the side of a bag. A tool is affixed to the opposite or free end. The tool may be retained on an outside surface of the bag by means of various fastening mechanisms such as a hook and loop fastener, a pocket and an elastic strap or a strap which is snapped into position to hold the tool. Various embodiments depict all of these alternatives although the alternatives described are not a limiting feature of the invention. Also as noted, a tool may be attached to the embodiments of  FIGS. 1-8  using the construction and/or techniques of the remaining figures.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0040]     Thus, referring first to  FIG. 9 , there is depicted a sports bag which has a generally rectangular parallelepiped shape with, for example, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">lateral side  70</span> , an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">open top compartment  80</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82">a generally second open top compartment  82</span>  defined by the sides of the bag. The bag may include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">center panel  84</span>  which divides the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">compartments  80</span>  and  82  one from the other. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">center panel  84</span>  may have a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem86">bungee cord  86</span>  attached thereto with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem88">fastener  88</span>  cooperative with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90">stud  90</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem92">front panel  92</span>  for positioning and holding the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem86">bungee cord  86</span>  over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">compartment  80</span>  to retain contents therein. Of course, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">compartment or enclosure  80</span>  may receive hard sided plastic boxes of the type previously described. Also, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">center panel  84</span>  may be associated with a construction of a sports bag of the type described in  FIGS. 1-8 . Further, the sport bag may merely include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">center panel  84</span>  associated with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">four side panels  70</span> ,  92 ,  94  and  96 . That is, the extendable lanyard construction described hereinafter can be used in combination with multiple types of sport bags.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0041]     Referring again to  FIG. 8 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">lanyard  100</span>  comprises a coiled cord which is extensible and attached at its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">one end  102</span>  to the outside face or surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">side  70</span> . Typically, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">side  70</span>  is comprised of a fabric material which may be reinforced with a board member sewn between layers of fabric or otherwise reinforced in order to maintain the shape of the bag. For example, wire reinforcing structures may be incorporated between the layers of fabric. In any event, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100">extension cord  100</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">tool  104</span>  affixed at its outer end. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">tool  104</span>  in this circumstance in the example may comprise a clipper. For example, if a sportsman, such as a fisherman, is using the bag of  FIG. 8 a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104"> clipper  104</span>  may be used to clip leader or line. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">clipper  104</span>  includes a wrap of a hook and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">loop fastener material  106</span>  which enables placement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">cutter or clipper  104</span>  against the outside face of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem92">panel  92</span>  for attachment thereto by cooperation with a section of hook and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">loop fastener material  108</span>  affixed to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem92">outside surface  92</span> .  FIG. 10  illustrates the arrangement described wherein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem104">tool  104</span>  is positioned against the hook and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">loop fastener attachment material  108</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0042]      FIGS. 11 and 12  illustrate a further alternative embodiment of the invention. In  FIGS. 11 and 12  the bag is substantially described in the prior  FIGS. 8-10 . However, a distinct type of tool attachment mechanism; namely, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">reel  110</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">cord  112</span>  which is attached to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem114">ring  114</span>  that is, in turn, attached to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem116">tool  116</span> , such as a clipper. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">reel  110</span>  is attached by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem118">clip  118</span>  to the outside face of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem120">end or lateral side  120</span>  of the bag in  FIGS. 11 and 12 . As depicted in  FIGS. 11 and 12  the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">reel  110</span>  stores the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">cord  112</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem112">cord  112</span>  may be withdrawn from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">reel  110</span>  or retracted back into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">reel  110</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0043]      FIGS. 13 and 14  illustrate yet a further embodiment. In these figures a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130">non-elastic or elastic cord  130</span>  is attached at <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem132">one end  132</span>  to the outside of the bag. The opposite end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem130">cord  130</span>  is attached to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem134">ring  134</span>  which is retained by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem136">snap strap  136</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem134">ring  134</span>  also is attached to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem138">clipper tool  138</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0044]      FIGS. 15 and 16  illustrate an embodiment wherein a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem140">removable clip  140</span>  is provided for attachment of one end of an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem142">elastic strap  142</span>  to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem144">ring  144</span>  attached to the outside face of a bag. The opposite end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem142">cord  142</span>  is attached to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem146">ring  146</span>  which is also attached to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem148">clipper tool  148</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem142">strap  142</span>  is an elastic strap in this embodiment.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0045]      FIGS. 17 and 18  illustrate a means for storage or retention of a tool. Thus, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem170">tool  170</span>  may be retained in a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem172">pocket  172</span>  formed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem174">outside face  174</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem176">panel  176</span> .

                        <p>          [0046]      FIG. 18  illustrates yet a further embodiment of the means for retention and releasably storing a tool. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180">Here tool  180</span> , mounted on an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem182">extensible coiled cord  182</span> , may be retained by an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem184">elastic strap  184</span>  mounted on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem184">outside face  184</span>  of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem188">lateral side panel  188</span>  of a bag. As depicted in  FIG. 20  the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180">tool  180</span>  is retained by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem184">elastic strap  184</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0047]     Multiple variations of the arrangement of attachment of a tool to the outside face or surface of any one of a number of panels comprising a bag may be employed, and a particular retention means is not a limiting feature of the invention. Among the important aspects of the constructions depicted, however, is the elasticity or elongation capability of the lanyard or cord connected to a tool. Multiple tools, of course, may be utilized including clippers, knives and the like. Preferably, another important feature of the invention is the fact that the tool can be retained temporarily in some type of pocket, elastic band, hook and loop fastener or the like. Additionally, the tool may be replaced and the lanyard may be totally replaced by providing for detachability of the one end of the lanyard from the outside face of the sport bag side panel. Further, the tools, lanyards and the like may be affixed to any one of the panels of the sports bag, including the back panel, lateral side panels or front panel.   </p>
