                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> Disclosed is a nail clipper provided with cutting edges having a curvature corresponding to a section and a curve of a nail, in which a blade body can be replaced with one having suitable cutting edges according to a shape and a size of a nail. In a nail clipper according to one embodiment of the present invention, cutting edges formed at one ends of upper and lower blades of a blade body are curved with a first curvature to the one end of the blade body while being bent with a second curvature with respect to the blade body. In a nail clipper according to another embodiment of the present invention, a blade body is removably received in a casing and a lever for applying force to the blade body is coupled to the casing. Since the blade body can be removably disposed in the casing, thus, it is possible that one having cutting edges corresponding to a size of the nail can be coupled to the casing, instead of the blade body. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0001]    1. Field of the Invention   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0002]    The present invention relates to a nail clipper, and more particularly to a nail clipper provided with cutting edges having a curvature corresponding to a section and a curve of a nail, in which a blade body can be replaced with one having suitable cutting edges according to a shape and a size of a nail.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0003]    2. Description of the Related Art   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0004]    Generally, a nail clipper is used for cutting finger and toe nails. Typical nail clipper is comprised of upper and lower blade each having cutting edge and a lever for applying force to the upper blade with respect to the lower blade so that the cutting edges of the upper and lower blades bring into contact with each other.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0005]    The cutting edges of the upper and lower blades of the nail clipper typically have a shape with curvature corresponding to a curve of a nail end. When user cuts nails with the nail clipper in order to care the nails, therefore, the nails are cut with a desired curvature by means of the cutting edges of the upper and lower blade of the nail clipper.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0006]    U.S. Pat. No. 6,438,845, which is issued to Kook E. Jung on Aug. 17, 2002, discloses a nail clipper device with a scissor-like cutting configuration.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0007]    [0007]FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the nail clipper according to Jung&#39;s Patent, and FIG. 2 is a side view of the nail clipper according to the Jung&#39;s Patent shown in FIG. 1.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0008]    As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span>  comprises elongated upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower operating members  12</span>  and  14  each having first ends joined together, and second ends terminating in spaced complimentary shaped cutting edges, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">post  18</span>  secured to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower operating member  12</span>  and movably extending through an aperture in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">upper member  14</span>  adjacent the cutting edges, and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever member  16</span>  having first and second ends with the end beginning pivotally secured to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">post  18</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0009]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever member  16</span>  is superimposed over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">upper operating member  14</span>  in a non-operable position. Also, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever member  16</span>  has a bent portion adjacent the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">post  18</span>  so that the lever member is first pivoted about the axis of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">post  18</span>  and pivoted in over the post to an operating position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0010]    The bent portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">lever member  16</span>  will bear against the upper operating member to move the cutting edge. Each cutting edge of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span>  has slanted cutting surfaces and complementary cutting surfaces that are moved adjacent to each other.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0011]    The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span>  according to the Jung&#39;s Patent constructed as described above has an advantage in that it can easily cut thick and inflexible finger and toe nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>            [0012]    In the nail clipper, however, since the cutting surfaces of the cutting edges are in flat, there is a disadvantage in that it is difficult to cut the nail along a curve of the nail when performing to cut the nail. In the casing of a large nail, since the nail is partially cut along the curve of the nail, especially, there is a problem in that it is very difficult to smoothly cut the nail at a time.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   </p>

                        <p>          [0119]    In the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem400">nail clipper  400</span>  according to the preferred fourth embodiment of the present invention, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem422">protrusions  422</span>   a ,  424   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem420">lever member  420</span>  are inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem434">rectangular-shaped holes  434</span>   a ,  436   a  formed at <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem434">both si<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem436">de wall portions  434 , 436</span></span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem430">casing  430</span> . Then, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem420">lever member  420</span>  is slideably disposed within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem430">casing  430</span>  so that it can slide along the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem434">rectangular-shaped holes  434</span>   a ,  436   a.     </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0120]    Thereafter, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem410">slide main body  410</span>  is inserted between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem420">lever member  420</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem439">horizontal member  439</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem430">casing  430</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem410">blade body  410</span>  is pushed into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem430">casing  430</span>  until the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem439">horizontal member  439</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem430">casing  430</span>  is engaged into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem416">elongated groove  416</span>  formed on the upper surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem412">upper blade  412</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0121]    Under the assembling state of the nail clipper, a user does not want to use the nail clipper, he makes an elastic force applied against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem410">blade body  410</span>  from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem420">lever member  420</span>  to be released by moving the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem430">casing  430</span>  backwards along the rectangular-shaped of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem430">casing  430</span> . Accordingly, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem410">blade body  410</span>  is at a standstill.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0122]    In the meantime, if the user wants to use the nail clipper, he makes the lever member to apply an elastic force against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem410">blade body  410</span>  by moving the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem420">lever member  420</span>  forward the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem430">casing  430</span>  along the rectangular-shaped of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem430">casing  430</span> . Accordingly, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem410">blade body  410</span>  is ready to use.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0123]    Under this state, if the user presses the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem410">blade body  410</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem430">casing  430</span>  with each other in order to cut his or her nail, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem420">lever member  420</span>  presses the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem414">lower blade  414</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem410">blade body  410</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem414">pressed lower blade  414</span>  may cut his or her nail with its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem414">cutting edge  414</span>   a  engaging with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem412">cutting edge  412</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem412">upper blade  412</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0124]    Meanwhile, if the user wants to replace the blade body in accordance with a size of the user&#39;s nail, he or she must separate the blade body from the casing on the contrary to the assembling sequence as described above. Thereafter, he or she can mount the blade body having a desired size of cutting edge into the casing.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0125]    As described above, in the nail clipper according to the preferred fourth embodiment of the present invention, it can use the blade body that is provided with the cutting edge having a desired radius of curvature corresponding to the radius of curvature of the nail to be cut in accordance with the size of the nail.   </p>
