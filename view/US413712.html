                        <p>  SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 413,712, dated October 29, 1889. 7 Application filed April 24, 1889- Serial No. 308,470. (No model.)   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern:   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Be itknown that I, J ULEs DE ROSE, a citizenof the United States, residing in the city and county of San Francisco, and State of California, have invented a new and useful Corn-Planer for Planing Corns, of which the following is a specification, reference being had to the accompanying drawings and the letters referring thereto.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Figure l is a&#39; front elevation showing my side elevation showing the corn-planer placed ready to operate upon a corn. Fig. 5 is a broken sectional side elevation showing the machine cut vertically and longitudinally through the center, and Fig. 6 is a&#39;perspective view of the outside frame with the planer:   </p>
                    
                        <p>  removed. r   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The following is the construction of my improved corn-planing machine: I form the various partsof such metals and material as are commonly employed in that class of manufacture. I form the outer frame A with upright guidesAQhaving the journal&#39;bearing slots K to fit, inside of the guides C. To the outer frame A, I attach the adjustable toebearings H by means of set-screws I. The journal-hooks E are hinged so as to be swung off the journals when the planer is to be lifted out to be used separately. I form the planer with a face-plate B, which is designed to have its bearing upon the&#39;top of the toe, and it has a throat D, similar to other. planes, to allow the shavings or cuttings to be thrown out. It also has the upright guides C, which secure it F, having the bit or cutter and crank J, in combination with the outsidein position laterally in the outside frame .A,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  and the revolving plane-stock F, which carries H are adjusted so as to hold firmly in position upon the toe, and as the stock F is revolved the bit G shaves 0d the corn, reducing it to a condition where it will cause no pressure, and consequently no pain. By repeated planings, thereby removing the pressure, the corn soon disappears entirely from the toe. When the corn is upon a part of the foot not accessible because of the outer frame, I remove the planer from the outer frame A and hold it so that the faceplate B will bear upon the foot and the corn be at the throat D. Then, the plane-stock and bit G being&#39;revolved, the corn is planed, as before described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Having thus described my invention, what claim, and desire to secure by Letters Patent,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  In corn-planing machines, the corn-planer composed of the frame B, with face-plate B,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  having the throat D, the revolving bit-stock G, the journal N,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  frame A, having the journal-hooks E, the journal-slots K, the adjustable bearings H, and set-screws I.   </p>
