                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> The present invention is a compound action complex pivotal multi-planar nail clipper. It is pivotal between four distinct pivot points and it includes a handle portion and a jaw portion which are attached to one another. The jaw portion may be curved or may be bent and terminates in a pair of opposed cutting blades. Thus, when a user holds the handle portion, the blades are displaced a pre-determined number of degrees with respect to the relative curvature or bending of the jaw portion. The handle portion and jaw portion are engaged to one another and are pivotal about two pivot points. The handle portion is preferably a pair of handles that are joined at a third pivot point by a first post member and the jaw portion is preferably a pair of jaw members joined at a fourth pivot point by another post member which is oblique with respect to the first post member. </p>

                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates to pivotal nail clippers, and more particularly to complex action compound pivot nail clippers having a multi-planar pre-molded semi-curved construction.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Information Disclosure Statement  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The following seven patents represent several variations on pivotal clippers which exemplify the art.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 756,056 to Ernest Roraback teaches cutting-nippers having a pair of jaws of oblate form in the plane of their meeting surfaces, the plane being obliquely inclined relative to the shank portion when the jaws are closed. The jaws each have a cutting edge located substantially in the plane of the sides and end of the jaws.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 837,473 to Luther Geo. Ihrig teaches an implement for deadening tobacco plants, comprising members pivotally connected together at an intermediate point in their length and having forward jaws, the inner edges of which are blunt and concave in the direction of their length and also having rear arms, and hand-levers pivotally connected together at their forward ends and pivotally connected at points in rear of their forward ends to the rear ends of the arms of the members. Each of the pivot points are disclosed as extending along axes being parallel to one another.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 1,163,733 to William A. Bernard teaches a clipper having jaws which are gently curved substantially throughout their length, and handle members which are similarly curved to form a continuation of the jaw curve. Each of the pivot points, however, are substantially parallel to one another.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 1,300,330 to William A. Bernard teaches a pair of lever handles that are preferably constructed of sheet metal, and that have forked forward portions which cross each other, and are pivoted together by means of a pivot pin. The pivot is located intermediate the ends of the crossed handle members, each of which is provided in advance of the parallel portions respectively forming the sides or branches of the forks. Between the parallel portions, a jaw is secured by means of a fastening pin. The pins respectively are both located in advance of the main pivot pin, and are preferably arranged at the forward extremities of the respective handle members, beyond which extremities the jaws extend forward. The cutters are so shaped as to form a sort of bowl so that the stem of an orange or the like can be so cut off as to leave no projection.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 1,411,785 to Albert Hoiland teaches a bolt clipper, including operating jaws positioned in the same plane and having a fulcrum point formed on the jaws. It further includes lever ends on the jaws extending from the fulcrum point and cutting ends on the jaws formed out of alinement with the lever ends extending from a point adjacent said fulcrum point.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No. 4,198,749 to Fred W. Nordin teaches a compound pivot plier-type clipper wherein a pair of handles is pivotally mounted on and between a pair of plates which form a recess for the reception of a selected pair of jaws which are mounted therein by removable means so that a kit can be furnished with a pair of handles and mounting plates and several of the same or different types of pairs of jaws which may be easily substituted, one for the other in the recess between the plates for operation by the handles. The parts are relatively thin so that they may be largely formed by mechanical or hydraulic press stamping operations with resulting low labor costs. A curved jaw is disclosed, but the pivot point for the jaw is parallel to all other pivot points.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      U.S. Pat. No.4,819,673 to Thomas J. McMullen, Jr. teaches a nail clipper which includes a one piece, U-shaped, plastic body having a pair of longitudinal handles with blades on one or both of the longitudinal handles of the device. An integral central arc portion bends when the longitudinal handles are compressed. The blades are aligned to provide a scissors-like interference cut. A receptacle for the nail clippings may also be provided, either between the two handles or, within the lower handle itself, or directly beneath the lower blade. The receptacle may be provided with a pivoting or removable cover. A file surface may also be affixed to the nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Notwithstanding the prior art in this field, it is believed that the present invention, which comprises a compound pivot complex action nail clipper, as described herein, is neither taught nor rendered obvious.  </p>

                        <p>      The present invention is a compound action, pivotal complex multi-planar nail clipper. It is pivotal between four distinct pivot points and it includes a handle portion and a jaw portion which are attached to one another. The jaw portion may be curved or angled with respect to the handle portion and terminates in a pair of opposed cutting blades. Thus, when a user holds the handle portion, the blades are displaced a pre-determined number of degrees with respect to the relative curvature or angle of the jaw portion. The handle portion and jaw portion are pivotally engaged to one another and are pivotal about two pivot points. The handle portion is preferably a pair of handles that are joined at a third pivot point by a first post member and the jaw portion is preferably a pair of jaw members joined at a fourth pivot point by another post member which is non-parallel to the first post member. What is meant by post member is any variety of pivotally engaging retaining members including but not limited to pins, posts, prongs, rivets, rods, screws, shafts and otherwise.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention nail clipper may be comprised of pre-molded individual plastic pieces, pre-forged metal pieces and any other suitable material known to be used in the art. It is to be understood that the present invention nail clipper may also comprise any number of sizes without exceeding the scope of the present invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIGS. 1 and 2 show side views of a present invention compound action complex pivotal nail clipper and FIG. 3 shows a top view of a present invention complex action compound pivot nail clipper, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. Referring to FIGS. 1 through 3,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> nail clipper 11</span> has<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> members 21 and 23</span></span> which are pivotally joined by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> post member 41</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> Handle member 21</span> has<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem121"> extension 121</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> handle member 23</span> has<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem123"> extension 123</span>, each of which are joined with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem131"> extens<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem133">ions 131 and 133</span></span> of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> jaw me<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">mbers 31 and 33</span></span> respectively.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem121"> Extens<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem131">ions 121 and 131</span></span> are shown being clamped together by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51"> clamp member 51</span> which is retained by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55"> screw member 55</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem123"> Extens<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem133">ions 123 and 133</span></span> are shown being clamped together by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53"> clamp member 53</span> which is retained by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem57"> screw member 57</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem121"> Extens<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem131">ions 121 and 131</span></span> are pivotally engaged to one another by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45"> pivot means 45</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem123"> Extens<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem133">ions 123 and 133</span></span> are pivotally engaged to one another by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47"> pivot means 47</span>.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45"> Pivot <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">means 45 and 47</span></span> are described in detail below with respect to FIGS. 4 through 7.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> jaw me<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">mbers 31 and 33</span></span> are curved and are pivotally joined by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43"> post member 43</span>, which is non-parallel, or more specifically, oblique with respect to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> post member 41</span>. Thus, the curvature of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> jaw me<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">mbers 31 and 33</span></span> with respect to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> members 21 and 23</span></span> is critical to the present invention because of the oblique compound pivot construction.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> Jaw me<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">mbers 31 and 33</span></span> terminate in<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> oppose<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">d cutting blades 35 and 37</span></span> which engage one another when<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> members 21 and 23</span></span> are biased inwardly by a user. Here,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem81"> compression spring 81</span> is maintained between<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> members 21 and 23</span></span>,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> thereb<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">y biasing handle members 21 and 23</span></span> outwardly and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> preven<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">ting cutting blades 35 and 37</span></span> from freely engaging one another. Thus, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> user m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">ust bias handle members 21 and 23</span></span> inwardly in order to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> engage<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37"> cutting blades 35 and 37</span></span> so as to clip a toenail or the like. While FIGS. 1 through 3 disclose a compression spring as a biasing means any alternative biasing member may be employed as a biasing means. In other words,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem81"> compression spring 81</span> is merely illustrative and any other biasing means may be employed. Additionally, the clipper may not even comprise a biasing means at all. Thus, the compound oblique pivot point embodiment provides a more useful and conducive instrument for users with ailments such as arthritis than other clippers presently available in the art.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The curved construction of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11"> nail clipper 11</span> allows a user to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> grasp <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">handle members 21 and 23</span></span> with either hand and to clip a toenail or the like without any awkward positioning of the nail clipper and without any excessive effort. Specifically,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21"> handle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> members 21 and 23</span></span> are held generally perpendicular a toe and the curvature of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> jaw me<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">mbers 31 and 33</span></sp<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">an> per<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">mit cutting blades 35 and 37</span></span> to be parallel to and flush with the tip of a toenail or the like. The pre-selected degree of curvature of the jaw members will alter the positioning of the handle members with respect to a user&#39;s toe. Thus, it is to be understood that the pre-selected curvature and the exact contours of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> jaw me<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">mbers 31 and 33</span></span> may vary slightly in degree without exceeding the scope of the present invention, i.e. a 45Â° to 90Â° curve. Likewise, the handle portion which comprises a generally linear portion may also have a curved portion which operates with a curved jaw portion.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIG. 4 shows a partial cut rear side view of a present invention complex action compound pivot nail clipper, illustrating details of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45"> pivot <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">means 45 and 47</span></span> which are<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem121"> define<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem123">d withi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem131">n exten<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem133">sions 121, 123, 131 and 133</span></span></span></span> as shown in FIGS. 1 through 3.

Line B defines the axis of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43"> post member 43</span> and line C defines the axis of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> post member 41</span>. The oblique angle H accordingly represents the degree of oblique displacement between the axes of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> post m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">ember 41 and 43</span></span>. It is preferable to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> define angle H between 25</span>Â° and 45Â°, but<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45"> most preferably about 45</span>Â°. The oblique angle G represents the degree of oblique displacement between the axis of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41"> post member 41</span> and the plane defined by the terminal ends of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">g blades 35 and 37</span></span>.
