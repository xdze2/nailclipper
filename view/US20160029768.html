                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> TECHNICAL FIELD  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]    The present invention relates to a tool for daily use, particularly to a tool for manicuring nails, and more particularly to a tool for manicuring nails conveniently, quickly and safely.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    Usually, nails are manicured with nail clippers or scissors. With the development of science, more and more people are using electric manicuring tools. The blade of such an electric manicuring tool is in a form of grinding disk so that nails are manicured by means of grinding. The grinding disk is usually made of a small grinding wheel or a frosted sheet metal. During grinding, the high-speed rotation of the grinding disk is likely to cause flying nail powders and burnt nails, accompanying with smell, and the high temperature generated by grinding makes people unpleasant, as a result, the effect of manicuring by such electric manicuring tools is unsatisfactory. In addition, such electric manicuring tools have high requirements for users. If used inappropriately, such electric manicuring tools will cause grinding by mistake and thus makes fingers or toes injured. In view of this, it is required to make many improvements to the manicuring tools. From Chinese Patent Database, for example, Patent CN102217830, entitled Automatic Nail Clipper, disclosed the following contents: an automatic nail clipper is provided, including a nail clipper, the nail clipper adopting a disk blade and including teeth and a body, the teeth being provided around the body; and further including a cover with an arc nail opening provided on the side of the cover.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]    In the automatic nail clipper of such a structure, there is only one nail opening of a general size, such automatic nail clipper has a quite limited application scope. This is because different people have fingers or toes of different size. For example, there is a big difference between fingers or toes of an infant and fingers or toes of a strong person. When such an automatic nail clipper is used, a finger or toe of an infant will be inserted into the nail opening completely and thus be injured, while a finger or toe of a strong person can not be inserted into the nail opening to be manicured. Even for a same person, fingers or toes are different in size. For example, the thumb is much bigger than the little finger. When such an automatic nail clipper is used, the nail of the thumb cannot be manicured sometimes.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0016]    Referring to  FIG. 1 ,  FIG. 2  and  FIG. 3 , the automatic and safe manicuring tool comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">disk blade  5</span> , a blade driving device and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cover  4</span> , where the blade driving device is connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">disk blade  5</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail openings  1</span>  are provided on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">cover  5</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail openings  1</span>  are corresponding to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">disk blade  5</span> . A plurality of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail openings  1</span>  of different size are provided on the periphery of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cover  4</span> . Therefore, a person may select an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">appropriate nail opening  1</span>  for manicuring according to the size of own fingers or toes when in use. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">Protruded arc slices  2</span>  are provided at the nail openings. The radian of the arc of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">each protruded arc slice  2</span>  is matched with that of a finger or toe, so the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">protruded arc slice  2</span>  will separate the muscle on the finger or toe from the nail during manicuring after the finger or toe is inserted into a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail opening  1</span> . Therefore, the muscle is obstructed outside the nail opening, while the nail is inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail opening  1</span> . After the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">disk blade  5</span>  is driven by the blade driving device, the nail is manicured. The manicuring is safe and reliable, and the finger or toe will not be injured. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">Arc pits  3</span>  matched with fingers or toes are provided within regions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail openings  1</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">arc pits  3</span>  are matched with the flesh parts of the fingers or toes. During manicuring, after the nail is inserted into a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail opening  1</span> , the flesh part of the finger or toe leans against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">arc pit  3</span> , so that it is very comfort during manicuring, and the manicuring is very aesthetic.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0017]    Referring to  FIG. 4 , this embodiment has a structure different from the above embodiment in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">that: movably detachable caps  8</span>  are provided on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cover  4</span> , and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail openings  1</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">arc pits  3</span>  are all provided on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">detachable caps  8</span> . The remaining structure is the same as the above embodiment. When provided on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cover  4</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">movably detachable caps  8</span>  may be provided by means of chutes. For example, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">chutes  6</span>  are provided on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cover  4</span> , and left and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">right swing plates  7</span>  are provided on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">movably detachable caps  8</span> , so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">movably detachable caps  8</span>  may be slipped-in or slipped-out for replacement through the fitting of the left and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">right swing plates  7</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">chutes  6</span> . As the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail openings  1</span>  in the above embodiment are fixed in size after installed, this structure may be not applicable to persons having particularly big fingers or toes or particularly small fingers or toes. Therefore, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail openings  1</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">detachable caps  8</span>  are designed to have different sizes and various specifications. In this way, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">detachable caps  8</span>  may be replaced to fit for more people. When all the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nail openings  1</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cover  4</span>  are not appropriate, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">detachable caps  8</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cover  4</span>  may be replaced. The movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cover  4</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">detachable caps  8</span>  is achieved by means of chutes. Of course, it may be achieved by means of buckles. For example, elastic buckles are provided on the detachable caps, and pits matched with the elastic buckles are provided on the cover. There are many ways for such movable arrangements, which have been well known in the field and will not be exemplified here one by one.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0018]    Referring to  FIG. 5 , this embodiment is an improvement on the basis of the second embodiment. Here, a plurality of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">detachable caps  8</span>  are provided on the periphery of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">cover  4</span> . This design is aimed at utilizing the upper surface area of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">detachable caps  8</span>  effectively. Similarly to the first embodiment, a plurality of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">selectable nail openings  1</span>  are provided to reduce the frequency of replacing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">detachable caps  8</span> . The remaining structure is the same as the second embodiment.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0019]    The structure provided by the present invention is convenient in application, high in safety and good in manicuring effect, and may be applied to all people, thus has good effect in use. </p>
