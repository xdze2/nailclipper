                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> Provided is a clipper for a nail made of a pair of cooperative jaws having sharpened edges which register by activating a lever member, the jaws having a normal tendency to separate, the lever member being mounted hingedly and turnably onto a means connecting said jaws for directing a force from said lever member to close said jaws, one of said jaws having a means for spacing said jaw a fixed distance from an interface between a distal part of said nail and skin, another of said jaws having a means for compressing said nail against said means for spacing, each of said jaws having a concave curvature and said jaws also exhibiting respective mating convex and concave edges. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The novel invention relates to a nail clipper, additionally constituted to provide an extension of a nail at its distal end, said extension being fixed and pre-determined by the dimensions of two integral parts of said clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      2. Description of the Prior Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The following issued patents comprise a portion of the developed pertinent prior art, to wit: U.S. Pat. No. 523,708 issued to La Casse in 1894; U.S. Pat. No. 846,565 issued to Havell in 1907; U.S. Pat. No. 860,975 issued to Havell in 1907; U.S. Pat. No. 775,568 issued to La May in 1904; U.S. Pat. No. 1,085,569 issued to La Casse in 1914; German Pat. No. 582,902 issued to Denk in 1933; British Pat. No. 249,289 issued to Allen in 1926; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,130,937 issued to Kim in 1978.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      None of the above cited patent references discloses a construction of a nail clipper similar to or anticipatory of the novel device of the invention described herein.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 523,708 issued to La Casse teaches only the contouring of a cutting edge for a nail and suggests only that the cutting edge may be suitably varied to conform to the desired form of the nail. La Casse shows only a contouring of the lower edge of a cutting face. In U.S. Pat. No. 775,568 issued to La May concave contouring first disclosed in La Casse is adapted to an upper cutting jaw.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In 1907, in U.S. Pat. No. 846,565 issued to Havell concave contouring of the upper cutting jaw of a nail clipper was used in combination with a downwardly turned sharp edge adapted to cooperate with a seat in the lower jaw of the nail clipper. However, in U.S. Pat. No. 860,975 also issued to Havell also in 1907 only concave contouring of the upper and lower jaws is suggested.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In U.S. Pat. No. 1,085,569 La Casse incorporates a concaved upper cutting edge which is downwardly turned in a concave fashion and adapted to mate with a lower cutting edge and jaw which is shaped in a convex fashion so as to mate with the downwardly turned concave blade of the upper jaw.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      British Pat. No. 249,289 to Allen in 1926 discloses a pair of concave mating cutting jaws. The German Pat. No. 582,902 issued to Denk discloses a specific adaptation of the combination of an upper and lower jaw concavely shaped and registered. In addition, the Denk clipper has a downwardly turned cutting blade in the upper jaw and a mating convexed lower cutting blade in the lower jaw.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The drawing in U.S. Pat. No. 4,130,937 issued to Kim suggests that concavely shaped upper and lower jaw members which register constitute an advantageous design without regard to any convolution of the horizontal plane which passes through the juncture of the upper and lower cutting edges.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is an object of the invention to provide a clipper for a nail which will permit a user to provide an unattached distal extension of said nail of a pre-determined width.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is a further object of the invention to provide a nail clipper device suitable for use by physicians to trim ingrown toenails to a pre-determined width.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is also an object of the novel invention to provide a lever for prying under an ingrown toenail to make the toenail accessible for cutting and yet provide a guard to prevent cutting of the nail at the nail-skin distal juncture.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is yet another object of the novel invention to provide a nail cutter which provides an optional selection of one of two pre-determined widths for an unattached distal extension of a nail after clipping.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is yet a further object of the novel invention to provide a clipper for a nail which dissipates the cutting force away from the line of impact made by the cutting edges of the clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The invention is a novel nail clipper constructed of a conventional upper jaw with an inverted arch shaped concave cutting edge adapted to mate with a conventional lower jaw having a convex, arched cutting edge, each jaw having a mated concave substantially vertical surface wherein the upper jaw has a flange extending orthogonally away from the upper cutting edge yet extending along the entire length of said upper cutting edge and wherein the lower jaw has platform having a width less than the width of said flange, the platform being adapted to fit under a nail and function in conjunction with the flange to grip the nail as it is partially cut into to dissipate the force exerted for cutting.  </p>

                        <p>      DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In the drawings, like reference characters designate similar parts in the several views of the invention shown in the drawing.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to FIG. 1 of the drawings, there is shown a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> in an exploded perspective view. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span>, of steel for example, is made of an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> upper member 12</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> lower member 14</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> lever member 16</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pivot bolt 18</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> pivot <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">nut 20</span> for said pivot bolt 18</span>, a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> connecting bolt 22</span>, and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> connecti<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">ng nut 24</span> for said connecting bolt 22</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span>, shown in FIG. 2, is assembled by inserting the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pivot bolt 18</span> through a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> hole 26</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> lever member 16</span>, then through a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> hole 27</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> upper member 12</span> and then through a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> hole 28</span> in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> lower member 14</span>. Thereafter, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> pivot nut 20</span> is attached to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pivot bolt 18</span> by means of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> threads 30</span> in a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> aperture 22</span> formed in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> pivot nut 20</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30"> threads 30</span> are adapted to mate with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> threads 34</span> formed at an end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pivot bolt 18</span>. Similarly, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> connecting bolt 22</span> is adapted to be inserted through<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> apertu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">res 36 and 37</span></span> which extend through the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> upper member 12</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> lower member 14</span>, respectively. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> connecting nut 24</span> has an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38"> aperture 38</span> with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> threads 40</span> therein adapted to mate with and connect to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> threads 42</span> formed at an end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> connecting bolt 22</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      There is shown in FIG. 2 the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> in cross-section and assembled. As shown, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> lever member 16</span> is adapted to pivot around the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pivot pin 18</span> in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Further, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> upper member 12</span> is adapted with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> jaw 44</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> lower member 14</span> is adapted with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> jaw 46</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> jaws 4<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">4 and 46</span></span> are normally open and separated from each other. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> jaws 4<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">4 and 46</span></span> are closed by the application of force on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> lever 16</span> along the vector F. Force applied to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> lever 16</span> along the vector F is transferred by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> pivot pin 18</span> to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> upper member 12</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> lower member 14</span>. Force transferred to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> upper member 12</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> lower member 14</span> is ultimately transferred mechanically to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> upper jaw 44</span> and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> lower jaw 46</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIG. 3a is a frontal view of the distal end of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> phalangeal appendage 50</span> such as, for example, a toe or a finger with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span> attached. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span> has a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> dorsal surface 54</span> and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> ventral surface 56</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span> is shown exhibiting an arc of curvature.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      There is shown in FIG. 3b a front view of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> jaw 44</span> and a front view of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> jaw 46</span>. Also shown is a front view of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> flange 58</span> integrally attached to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> upper jaw 44</span> and extending along the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> upper jaw 44</span> above an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> upper cutting surface 60</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> upper jaw 44</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> flange 58</span> also orthogonally tapers away from the upper and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> lower <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">jaws 44 and 46</span></span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> flange 58</span> exhibits an arc of curvature similar to that exhibited by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span> shown in FIG. 3a. There is also shown in FIG. 3b a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> lower cutting surface 62</span> which exhibits a convex or inverted arc of curvature. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> lower cutting surface 62</span> is attached to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> lower jaw 46</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> upper cutting surface 60</span> has an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> edge 64</span> which, from the front view shown in FIG. 3b, exhibits a downwardly turned concaved curvature with fang-like ends which are an integral part of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> upper jaw 44</span>. The curvature of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> edge 64</span> is adapted to register and mate with the curvature of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> lower cutting surface 62</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> lower cutting surface 62</span> has an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> edge 66</span> which is convexed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span> in FIG. 3a is cut or clipped by cooperation between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> upper jaw 44</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> lower jaw 46</span> whereby the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> upper jaw 44</span> proximates with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> lower jaw 46</span> upon application of force along the vector F. There is shown in FIG. 4a one position of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> novel clipper 10</span> utilized to perform a clipping operation on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span> is shown within a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68"> space 68</span> between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> upper jaw 44</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> lower jaw 46</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span> is shown held between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> upper cutting edge 64</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> lower cutting edge 66</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> flange 58</span> is shown in FIG. 4a in cross-section. Also shown in FIG. 4a is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> platform 70</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> platform 70</span> extends in a tapered fashion orthogonally away from the upper and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> lower <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">jaws 44 and 46</span></span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> platform 70</span>, an integral part of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> lower jaw 46</span>, is specifically designed to have a width d which is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> approximately 50</span>% of a width D for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> flange 58</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In FIG. 4b the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> upper jaw 44</span> is shown with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> flange 58</span> making contact with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> dorsal surface 54</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> lower jaw 46</span> is shown with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> platform 70</span> making contact with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> ventral surface 56</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> flange 58</span> is specifically shown with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> ventral surface 72</span> in contact with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> dorsal surface 54</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span>. As force is applied along the vector F, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">g edges 64 and 66</span></span> cut into the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span>. During this operation, force is transferred from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> upper jaw 44</span> and dissipated along the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> ventral surface 72</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> flange 58</span> as well as along the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> platform 70</span>. This dissipation of force tends to alleviate the clicking sound normally associated with nail clipping and also alleviates substantial bending of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span> during the clipping operation. Further, the transfer of force along the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> platform 70</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72"> ventral surface 72</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> flange 58</span> lessens trauma to the nail-bed at the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74"> nail bed juncture 74</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring again to FIG. 1, there is shown the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> flange 58</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> platform 70</span> in perspective view. Also shown is the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> cutting edge 64</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> cutting edge 66</span>. Also illustrated is the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> cutting surface 60</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62"> cutting surface 62</span>. Both the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> jaw 44</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> jaw 46</span> have a substantially concaved curvature as exhibited by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80"> surface 80</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> jaw 44</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82"> surface 82</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> jaw 46</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> lever member 16</span> is adapted with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84"> protrusion 84</span> to provide a levering action when force is applied to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> lever member 16</span> along the vector F.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A unique feature of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> novel nail clipper 10</span> as shown in FIG. 2, is that when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> shown in FIG. 2 is utilized up-side-down with respect to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> appendage 50</span> and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span> previously described and shown in FIG. 4a, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> flange 58</span> provides an optional greater spacing of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">g edges 66 and 68</span></span> away from the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50"> appendage 50</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> flange 58</span>, when using the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> novel nail clipper 10</span> in the fashion shown in FIG. 2, permits a user to provide an unattached distal extension E for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span> with the distal extension E having a pre-determined width E.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring now to FIG. 4b and comparing FIG. 4b with FIG. 2, it may be observed that utilizing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> in the fashion shown in FIG. 4b permits the user of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> to provide a smaller unattached distal extension e of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span> with the extension e having a pre-determined width e,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> for example 1</span>.25 mm. Utilizing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> clipper 10</span> in the fashion shown in FIG. 4b, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70"> platform 70</span> provides and determines the location of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64"> cuttin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">g edges 64 and 66</span></span> with respect to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The mode of operation and use of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span> and utility of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> nail clipper 10</span>, shown in FIG. 2, is specifically adaptable to the clipping and removal of the unattached distal extension of an ingrown toe nail, for example,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The nail-skin distal juncture is shown at 90 in FIG. 4b and at 90 in FIG. 2. Cutting of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span> at this juncture can cause pain and is a common occurrence with conventional nail cutters. Cutting of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span>, for example, with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10"> novel nail cutter 10</span> prevents cutting of a nail, for example the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> nail 52</span>, at the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90"> nail-skin distal juncture 90</span>.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      While the foregoing has illustrated and described what is now contemplated to be the best mode of carrying out the invention, the description is, of course, subject to modifications pursuant to the doctrine of equivalents without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, it is not desired to restrict the invention to the particular construction illustrated and described, but to cover all modifications that may fall within the scope of the invention pursuant to equivalents to the appended claims. </p>
