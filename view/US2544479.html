                        <p>   The nger nail trimmer shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3 comprises two side plates 32 and 33 connect<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">ed at o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">ne, end by an integral resilien</span></span>t loop portion 34 and adapte<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">d to receive and hold therebetween </span>one of the halves 35 of a broken safety razor blade of a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> well know</span>nstandard type. In double edged blades of this type the two halves are connected adjacent their ends onlyand are readily `broken apart to provide the half blade herein shown. The two side by side plates 32 and33 are provided along one e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">dge with-any de</span>sired number of registeringv notches 33. The notches 36 can b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">e formed transversely of</span> the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">plates orv </span>at an angle thereto, as may be desired.- The notches 36 when formed at an angle to Ythe pl<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">ates better</span> adapt the trimmer for making a slicing or angular cut, as hereinafter explained. Preferably the outer corners of the metal sections between the notches 36 are rounded olf, as shown in the d<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">rawings, to</span> obviate the possibility of scratching the outer surfaces of the finger nails in the use of this linger nail trimmer. 1 i 1 The side plates 32 yand 33 are preferab<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">ly oi </span>diff<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">erent w<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">idth and</span> the edg</span>e portion 31 of the Wider side plate 33 op<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">posite the notch</span>es 33 i<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">s bent U shape as sh</span>own in Figs. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">l and 3, so</span> that this portion 31 can be selectively used to support<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> the rear e</span>dge portions of broken or whole blades of two different widths, as hereinafter explained. Preferably a notch 38 is provided in the plate 33 and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">doubled o</span>ver edge portion 31<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> and said</span> notch extends into t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">he plate 32. Thi</span>s notch facilitates pushing a bl<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">ade out o</span>f the holder.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Preferably an attachment hole 39 is provided in the side pl<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">ates 32 and 33 near</span>the loop portion 34<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> so tha<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">t this device c</span></sp<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">an>an be attached &#39;to a</span> lkey ring, chain or the like. Also preferably a roughened or serrated surface 45 is provided <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">on the blade holder, such as on t</span>he plate 32 to serve as a finger nail le.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   To<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> facilita</span>te the use either of one half 35 of a relatively thin double .edge<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">d blade, as </span>shown vin Fig. 1, or of a standard-safety razor blade 4l of narrower vwidth but of greater thickness, as shown in Fig. 3, the bent over portion 31 of the plate 33 is positioned rela<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">tively clos</span>etothe <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">opposed s</span>ide of said-plate 33 so as to leave therebetween a s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">pace 42,?Fig33</span>, ljust wideenough to receive <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">the thinn</span>er 4half blade 35, Fig. :1, but .not wid<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">eenough tore- &#39;ceiv</span>e`the thicker blade 4I, Fig. 3. When .a .half blade 35 is used in this holder, *as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> shown Ain Fig. 1,</span> the&#39;fback vedges 243 of this half blade &<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem243">#39;35 `will rest against</span> and be supported .by the part forming the bottom of the space 42. This will properly :position .-the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">.cutting </span>:edge portion of the half blade 35. When a thicker Vblade 4I of fa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> narrower :sta</span>ndard &#39;width .is fused .in this holder ztheoack :edge .portion .of-this narrowerfbnt ythickereblad&#39;e will rest gagainstandtbe stopped and positionedby .the forward edge of the bent over portion 31. In each instance the blade2i-5 or<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> 4i is so p</span>ositioned by the stop means that the notched &#39;edgeportion of theplates 32and 33 Aex- .35 about one-sixteen<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">th of an inch Wideh</span>ave been v found to be satisfactory.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The :plates 32 and 33 are resiliently connected :<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">loop portio</span></span>n 34 and 4will engage iwith the si<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">des Aof ,either </span>ofthe blades 35 or 4i with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">enough rforce .to firmly .and secu</span>relyhold `either of ,said   </p>
                    
                        <p>  .blades At the :same time said plates willyield relative .to each other sufficiently to permit easy insertion andremoval of either of theblades. The notch 3B facilitates the removal of either blade .35 or v4| and said notch also facilitates endwise u movement of either blade in the holder to there- -by bring new and sharper portions of the blade in registration with the vnotches 35. Also the blade 35 canjbe turnede<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">ndfor endin </span>the holder<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> to bring</span> new and sharper sectionsof the blade into registration with the ynotches 3b.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Also the blade *35 can be positionedso that it extends outwardly from the end of the holder shown -atthe leftiin Fig. 1 and this outwardly extending and unguarded portion of the blade can beused&#39;like a knife blade for finger nail trimming &#39;or lfor other purposes.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Throughout the following description and on all figures of the drawing hereinafter described the numerals 35,&#39;1&#39;36g391and -43--are use<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">d tofdesigna</span>te respectively blade members, notches, attachment openings and serrated file surfaces similar to those shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The blade holder shown in Figs. 4 and 5 is similar to the one shown in Figs. l, 2 and 3 and comprises two side plates 44 and 45 connected<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> at one<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45"> end by an integral resilient</span></span> loop portion 45. The plate<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">s 44 and 45 have .registering notch</span>es 36<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">, of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">form herei</span></span>nbefo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">re described, in one edg</span>e portion thereof. Preferably the plate 45 is of greater -width than the plate <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">44 and is</span> slightly wider than the half <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">35 of the</span> safety razor blade shown there<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">in. The </span>narrower plate 44 leaves the back edge portio<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">n of the half blad</span>e 35 uncovered and allows access to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">said back edge</span> portion of the half blade 35 to facilitate properly position<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">ing said half </span>blade in -the holder. Stop members 41 are engaged by V-shaped notch<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">es 48 in the rea</span>r edge portion <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">of the half blade 35</span> and said half blade is thereby <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">positioned `rb</span>oth longitudinally and transversely. Thefstop members y41 and notches the holderare relatively positioned so that different portions of the cutting edge of the blade canbe brought into registration with the notches 36 &#39;by turning said blade end for<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> end. Thus </span>if a sharp Ihalf blade -35 is inserted and used until the exposed cutting edge portions thereof become dull it can be turned end for `end to bring previously unused sharp sections thereof into registration xwith the notches 36. Also a blade of narrower width th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">an the blad</span>e :member T35, such as the vblade member 4I shown .in Fig. 3, canbe used in the holdershownin Figsl and.5 with the back edge of -the blade resting against the stop membersil-l.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   &#39;The blade holder Vshown in Fig. 6 is similar to the blade holder shown in Fig. 1 except that the closed or looped-end portionthereof ris made longer and vwider and is .suitably shaped to form a bottle opener [S1-of a type adapted for removing clinched metal caps from bottles.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The nger&#39;nail trimmer shown-inFigs. 7, 8 and 9 Vis adapted to receive and hold a double edged safety razor blade 52 of standar<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">d construction that&#39;has not bee</span>n broken into two halves as has the .blade 35 shown in Fig. 1. The holder of Figs<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">. 7, 8 and</span> 9 comprises two side `plates 4B and 43 connected with-each other atione end by a resilientloop portion t50. lPlates &#39;43 and 49 have registering notches 36 vin both edges thereof<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> which function in the </span>same Avrnanneras the notches 36 in the previously described figure<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">s. Also eac</span>h plate v48 andrll!) is &#39;provided with&#39;a longitudinally disposed medialslot 5l which extends inwardly from the end of :the plate opposite the loop 5t. The two plates 48 and 49 register with each other<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> andare<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem49"> adaptedto sli</span></span>dably receive a blade holding and positionngmember 53. The member 53 shown in F<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">igs. 7 and 9 is rela</span>tivel<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">y short bu</span>t obviously this member can be longer if desired .to provide a holding member of greater strength. The member 53 has two spaced apart portions 54 wh<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">icheareada</span>pted<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> to extend throughalongitudin</span>al slot in the blade 52 and through the slots 5i4 in the pla<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">tes 4B an</span>d 49. The portions 54 are provided at one end with .two<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54"> oppositclyd</span>irected transverse &#39;flanges&#39;55 .and at the other end with one transverse` flange 51. Preferably blade h<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">olding member V53 is forme</span>d of a single piece of sheet metal bent to provide the desiredshape.   </p>

                        <p>   Fig. 16 is a fragmentary perspective view of a blade holding device adapted to receive and hold a detachable can opener blade 18. The holder of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> Fig. 16 comprises two side pla</span>tes l! and &#39;l2 connected by a resilient loop portion 13. The blade &#39;Hi <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">has a flange &#39;M extend</span>ing at right angles therefrom. When the ange 14 of blade &#39;mis telescopically inse<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">rted, by</span> endwise movement of said blade and iiange, between the plates &#39;il and 12 and back of a stop member &#39;l5 on the plate &#39;H and blade 16 will be rmly supported in the operat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">ive posit</span>ion shown. When the can opener blade &#39;iii is not to be used it is withdrawn endwise from the position shown inFig. 16 and is taken care of by inserting said blade i6 between the plates &#39;il and l2 either forwardly of the flange &#39;F4 or at the side of said plates opposite to the iiange ld.   </p>
