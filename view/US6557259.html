                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A nail clipper of this invention has a somewhat V-shaped handle portion formed of a first upper handle and a second lower handle each of which is pivotally mounted with respect to the other, and movable toward the other. A nail holder, having an arcuate slot for the receipt of an artificial nail, extends forwardly from the lower handle. A cutter assembly having a forwardly disposed arcuate blade edge, is slidably mounted and interconnected to the upper handle&#39;s movement whereby it is actuated forwardly over the nail holder to carry out a cutting motion against a nail disposed in the nail holder&#39;s slot, upon the application of force to the two handles and moved rearwardly by a release of the grip of the upper portion. The apparatus also includes an elevation setter which may be used for controlling the size of cut of a nail inserted into the nail holder slot. A sizing tool may be employed with the elevation setter to preset the length of the nail to be worn. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This invention pertains to an apparatus for trimming and shaping artificial nails to any length as may be desired by the wearer of the nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      This invention relates generally to fingernail apparatuses, particularly to those of the clipper designation, which are used for the cutting of both artificial and natural nails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Since the main purpose of this apparatus is for cutting artificial nails most of the discussion will pertain to that topic.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Artificial nails are pre-formed elongated plastic materials usually of an acrylic material or of fiberglass and are attached to the natural nail through a suitable cement. They are then clipped to the desired length with cuts across the body of the artificial nail structure such as by the use of this invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As is known in the art artificial nails are mounted in place by attaching the natural nail to the artificial nail&#39;s underside using any known suitable cement. The artificial nails once mounted are clipped or trimmed to a desired length and shape. The clipping that takes place calls for one or more lateral cuts to be made from front to back or from back to front through the thickness of the nail. The rough edge is then filed into a smooth continuous curvature and then buffed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      One of the problems that arises in nail trimming is the difficulty in achieving uniform length in a set of nails. That problem can be overcome with the use of the apparatus of this invention, for the trimming of the totality of ten nails, all to a same even size such as to closely approach the look of natural fingernails.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Apparatuses to trim artificial nails are not new to the art. Thus I refer to U.S. Pat. No. 505,513 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,727,318 both issued to Gary J. Reiswig of Tigard Oreg. 97224. In both of these, a pivotable member causes a cutting blade to slide forward is employed to effect the cutting of the nail.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Other attempts have been made over the years to trim artificial nails. Sometimes persons have attempted to adapt nail clippers for natural nails to be utilized for the trimming of artificial nails. While cutting may transpire, it is generally recognized that such apparatuses are not deemed acceptable to those who practice the art of the application of artificial nails for a living.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Thus, in addition to those recited above, applicant is familiar with the following U.S. patents:  </p>

                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The nail clipper of this invention has a somewhat V-shaped handle portion formed of a first upper handle and a second lower handle each of which is movable toward the other member by the application of force and away from each other by the expansion of a coil spring disposed between the upper and lower handles. A nail holder, having an arcuate slot for the receipt of an artificial nail, extends forwardly from the lower handle. A blade having a forwardly disposed arcuate cutting edge, disposed above said nail holder, is slidably mounted and interconnected to the upper handle whereby upon the application of a downward force to the upper handle, a forward motion is applied to the cutter assembly containing said blade, by means attached to said upper handle to carry out a cutting motion against a nail disposed in the slot.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      An elevation setter disposed through the nail holder, which can be moved upwardly and downwardly, is used to control the length of the cut of the nail disposed in the nail holder. A sizing tool for use in conjunction with the elevation setter for pre-setting a specifically desired length of cut of a nail cut also forms part of this invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The artificial nail trimmer of this invention is seen in whole or in part in all of the figures. FIG. 5 is a sectional view used to help explain the assembly of this tool. In FIGS. 17 and 18 the sizing tool for use herewith is shown and discussed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The invention  10 , as shown in FIGS. 1-3, has upper and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">lower handle portions  11</span> ,  12 . The upper portion has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">top wall  15</span> B, and two paralle<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">l downwardly depending spaced sidewalls  15</span> A,  15 C; while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">bottom portion  12</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">base wall  13</span> B and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">two spaced upwardly depending sidewalls  13</span> A,  13 C. See also FIG. 3, the diameter of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">base wall  13</span> B is slightly greater than the diameter of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">top wall  15</span> B such that when squeezed the two handles can move toward each other, whereby the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper handle portion  11</span>  partially nests within the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower portion  12</span> , when the two handle portions are squeezed. The sidewalls of both the upper and lower handle portions are tapered such that each is larger toward the front of the device as can be seen from FIG. 1 among others. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper handle portion  11</span>  terminates in its forward extension just past the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pivot pin  26</span>  which passes through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">ears  20</span>  overlying the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower handle portion  12</span> . However, the extension of the of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower handle portion  12</span>  is greater in that as per FIG. 2, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">base  13</span> B extends arcuately convexly just beyond <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">assembly screw  35</span> . In FIG. 6 the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">sidewalls  13</span> A,  13 C of the lower handle portion extend forwardly and inwardly to form a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">generally rectangular passage  58</span>  in which a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">stationary nail holder  28</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">slidable blade  36</span>  are retained. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">top wall  59</span> T of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">passage  58</span>  includes a pair of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">plates  59</span> A.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In FIGS. 1 and 5 there is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">also seen set screw  17</span> ,which is retained by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">nut  101</span> , which screw acts as the upper retainer for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">coil spring  43</span>  disposed thereon, which spring serves to return the two handles to their at rest spaced apart position. The lower end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">spring  43</span>  is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">disposed upon set screw  37</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">set screw  37</span>  is retained by another <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">nut  101</span> . The head of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">screw  37</span>  is seen in the bottom plan view FIG. 2 disposed in a recessed manner in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem103">recess  103</span>  such that the head can sit flush with its surroundings. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17"> </p>
                    
                        <p>      Set screw  17</span>  is inserted through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem110">aperture  110</span>  beneath the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">recess  102</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">upper portion  15</span> B and is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">threaded into nut  101</span> . By preferably providing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem102">recess  102</span>  into which the head of the set screw can rest, and can be mounted flush with the surface of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">portion  15</span> B, when threadedly engaged.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In order to achieve optimal operation, that is, contraction and elongation of the spring, it has been found that the angle of mounting of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">upper set screw  17</span>  should<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105"> be about 105</span> degrees from the horizontal, while the lower set screw is optimally mounted at<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem100"> about 100</span> degrees from the horizontal as per FIG.  5 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Note, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem101">nuts  101</span>  can be designed as rivets as per FIG. 20, as such the rivets can be engaged with the upper and lower handle portions needless the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">set screws  17</span>  and  37 . The rivets are inserted through the handle portions and are engaged by riveting on the ends of the rivets.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">An inverted generally U-shaped jaw  19</span> , per FIG. 1, is disposed forwardly of the upper handle portion, and is attached by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pin  26</span>  which can serve as a pivot pin through each of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">bores  21</span> , of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">ear sections  20</span>  at the rear of each of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">sidewalls  19</span> S of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">U-shaped jaw  19</span> . The two ear sections are those areas of  19 S that are behind the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">top wall  19</span> T. Note the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">pin  26</span>  also passes through bores in the lower handle portion, such as the upper, lower handle portions and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">jaw  19</span>  are engaged together.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">retention screw  18</span> , per FIG. 5 serves to receive and retain the upper end of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">spring  51</span> , is threaded through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">bore  15</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem190">recess  190</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">top wall  19</span> T.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Forward of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">retention screw  18</span>  is the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">elevation setter  21</span>  which has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">shaft  23</span> whose upper end is threaded and which is retained by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">threaded nut  25</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">base  24</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">elevation setter  21</span>  is welded, brazed or otherwise attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">shaft  23</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">shaft  23</span>  is disposed for vertical movement, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">within bore  31</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">reinforcing annulus bolt  50</span> , per FIG. 5, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">which annulus bolt  50</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">gear top  55</span>  as seen in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">closeup view  10</span> B. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">Bolt  50</span>  is positioned into place, through a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">bore  56</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">top wall  59</span> T of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">rectangular passage  58</span>  as per FIGS. 5,  6  and  11 , and it passes through a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">slot  38</span> S of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">blade  36</span> . A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">threaded bore  32</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">frontal area  44</span> A of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">nail holder body  34</span>  serves to receive the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">bolt  50</span>  for retention. Thus the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">shaft  23</span>  is slidable in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">jaw  19<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"></span>  via aperture  16</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower handle portion  12</span> . See FIGS. 5 and 13.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As is also seen in FIG. 5, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">shaft  23</span>  also passes adjacent a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">knife edge  115</span> , which serves to prevent movement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">shaft  23</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">bolt  50</span> , which has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">bore  31</span> , not only serves as a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">residence for shaft  23</span> , but also serves to control the clearance of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">moveable cutter assembly  36</span> , which reciprocates during the cutting cycle. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">set screw  35</span> , inserted through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">bore  47</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">base  13</span> B, which set screw is threadingly engaged with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">nail holder  28</span>  by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">threaded bore  48</span> . This screw serves to retain the nail holder to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">base  13</span> B of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower handle portion  12</span> . The post of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">screw  35</span>  extends through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">washer  117</span>  which itself is disposed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">slot  38</span> S of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">blade  36</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Since it was determined that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">bolt  50</span>  can easily come loose when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">blade  36</span>  slides forwardly or backwardly over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">nail holder  28</span> , due to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">straight side  37</span> S of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">slot  38</span> S of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">blade  36</span>  being in contact with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">bolt  50</span>  during blade movement, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">said tooth gear  55</span>  was added as shown in FIGS. 11 and 15 to prevent rotation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">bolt  50</span>  by engagement with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">gear lock washer  62</span>  which has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">front point  60</span>  shaped like an arrowhead and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">rear tail  64</span>  per FIG.  9 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">front point  60</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">gear lock washer  62</span>  is engaged with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">tooth gear  55</span>  while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">rear tail  64</span>  is inserted through a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem65">bore  65</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">top wall  59</span> T. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">Set screw  61</span>  passes through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">bore  66</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">gear lock washer  62</span>  and engages the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem63">threaded bore  63</span>  in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">top wall  59</span> T per FIG.  11 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Thus it is seen that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">tail  64</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">lock washer  62</span>  and the post of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">set screw  61</span>  can not be extended over the thickness of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">top wall  59</span> T as per FIG. 13 such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">blade  36</span>  can move. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">Set screw  61</span>  serves to retain the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">washer  62</span>  such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">tooth gear  55</span>  can not move and therefore the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">bolt  50</span>  can not rotate to become loosened.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The positioning of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">elevation setter  21</span>  can be understood by reference to FIG.  5 . Reference to other FIGURES is also encouraged. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">elevation setter  21</span>  is used exactly for the purpose for which this element is named. When a person inserts her nail, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem95">or arti<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">ficial nail  95</span>  into slot  30</span>  (FIG. 12) from the underside of the apparatus, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem97">tip  97</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem96">finger  96</span>  for the nail to be cut is placed in contact with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">base  24</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">elevation setter  21</span> . See FIG.  12 . This automatically determines the amount of nail to be trimmed. Th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem98">e more downwardly per directional arrow  98</span>  the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">elevation setter  21</span>  is positioned, the lesser the amount of nail will be trimmed by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">cutter blade edge  39</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The discussion now moves to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">elevation setter  21</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">shaft  23</span>  thereof can be readily moved downwardly with a minimum of effort as FIG.  13 . But attempts to raise the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">elevati<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">on setter  21</span>  shaft  23</span>  upon application of the same slight pressure fail. This is due to the construction of the apparatus. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> </p>
                    
                        <p>      Shaft  23</span>  is frictionally retained in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">bore  31</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">annular bolt  50</span>  which passes through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">nail holder unit  28</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">Shaft  23</span>  also passes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">knife edge  115</span>  and passes through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">aperture  16</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">can be seen coil spring  51</span> , which upper end is mounted on the post section of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">retention screw  18</span>  and lower end is disposed upon the on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">post set screw  35</span> , exerts a force upwardly when it is relaxed, against the underside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">jaw  19</span> . This <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">pressure keeps knife edge  115</span>  impinging against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">shaft  23</span> . A slight finger pressure on the head of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">retention screw  18</span>  is enough to move the knife edge downwardly just slightly, as <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">spring  51</span>  compresses a bit. This permits the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">elevation setter  21</span> , to be raised back upwardly, as per FIG.  5 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">small coil spring  51</span> &#39;s upper end is seen to be mounted on the post of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">retention screw  18</span>  as previously discussed. For best results it has been found that the angle of mounting of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">retention screw  18</span>  should<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115"> be about 115</span> degrees from the horizontal.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75">reinforcement plate  75</span> , shown in FIG. 8, is held in place by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">set screws  27</span>  on the underside of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">top wall  19</span> T of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">jaw  19</span>  as per FIG. 6, has the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">preferably U-shaped knife edge  115</span>  seen in FIG. 8, and was discussed previously. The knife edge is preferably U-shaped in order to provide as much surface area as possible in contact with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">shaft  23</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27">set screws  27</span>  whose head are best seen in FIG. 16 are inserted through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">elongated bores  14</span>  on opposite sides of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">aperture  16</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">top wall  19</span> T, and are threadingly engaged with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75">plate  75</span> , in which are the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">threaded bores  76</span>  per FIG.  5 . These elongated bores permit the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75">plate  75</span>  to be adjusted forwardly such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem115">knife edge  115</span>  always impinges against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">shaft  23</span>  to thereby keep the jaw closed in an accurate disposition.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Also seen in FIG. 1 and 2 among others is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">nail holder ring  29</span> , having an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">internal slot  30</span>  therein for receiving the nail to be cut. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">nail holder ring  29</span>  has <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">an inwardly directed upstanding flange  33</span> . This <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">flange  33</span>  prevents a cut nail, subsequent to cutting, from “flying” forwardly from the apparatus toward the lap of the customer. The flange, acts to inhibit such movement, such that the cut nail merely drops downwardly into a tray or onto the workstation of the manicurist.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In FIG. 2 as referenced infra is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">crescent  29</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">Crescent  29</span> , also referred to as the nail holder ring, has a curved rearwardly and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem87">upwardly tapered inner edge  87</span>  which may serve as a rest for the front of the artificial nail prior to trimming, as is demonstrated in FIG.  2 . In FIG. 1, a top perspective view, edge taper can not be seen. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem87">edge  87</span>  permits the artificial nail to assume a position other than generally vertical for the trimming operation as desired for a visible feathered edge of the nail, by resting the nail against the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem87">tapered edge  87</span>  per FIG.  12 . For a straight cut, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem95">nail  95</span>  is placed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">slot  30</span>  at an angle of 90 degrees from the horizontal, also seen in FIG.  12 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In FIG. 14, there is shown the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">nail holder  28</span>  disassembled from any other elements of the apparatus. Thus it can be further seen that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">holder ring  29</span>  which is wider than the body to which it is attached, is in fact attached by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">wings  20</span> W to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">nail holder body  34</span> &#39;s visible or main part  44 A as seen from the top. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">Aperture  30</span>  separates the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">crescent  29</span>  from the main body adjacent the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">wings  20</span> W. The balance of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">portion  44</span> A and the remainder of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">body  44</span> B of a narrower width, is attached in the same plane at the rear of  44 A which in point of fact is shaped like an arrowhead. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem77">notches  77</span>  that arise due to the difference in width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">two portions  44</span> A and  44 B of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">main body  34</span>  are employed to permit the forward motion progress of the cutter assembly by enabling the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem107">pushers  107</span>  seen in FIG. 13 to operate.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In FIG. 4A, a top plan view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">device  10</span>  of this invention, just prior to trimming a nail is seen. The point in time is confirmed by the fact that no part of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">blade edge  39</span> . And, both the upper handle portion and the lower handle portions are seen. However contrast FIG. 4A with FIG. 4B wherein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper handle portion  11</span>  has nested into the lower handle portion and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">section  13</span> B is no longer visible. Note also movement forwardly of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">blade edge  39</span>  is seen to have transpired. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">blade edge  39</span>  has been designed as a curved forward cutting edge whose diameter is slightly greater than the diameter of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">curved aperture  30</span>  of the nail holder,  28 . Reference to FIG. 16 reveals the fact that the nail to be cut, will have the cut commence from the two edges of the nail inwardly toward the middle of the nail. This is due in part to the curvature of the artificial nail. Note the placement of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem96">nail  96</span>  in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">slot  30</span>  in this FIGURE. By employing such a technique, a smooth cut of the nail can be easily had.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In FIG. 15, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">non-assembled cutter assembly  36</span>  is seen. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">Slot  38</span> S is locus for the disposition of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">bolt  50</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">washer  117</span>  into which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">post screw  35</span>  seen in FIG. 11 is passed through. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">slot  38</span> S is needed to permit the cutter assembly to move forward with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">bolt  50</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">washer  117</span>  which is retained by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">post screw  35</span>  are imposition, such that the travel of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">blade  36</span>  during the cutting process is limited rearwardly by the presence of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">bolt  50</span>  and is limited forwardly by the presence of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">washer  117</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">blade  36</span>  also includes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">notches  38</span> R, in which serve as <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem113">residences for noses  113</span>  which have <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105">pulling edge  105</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">rear sections  108</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutter assembly  36</span>  having <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">front sides  11</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem109">rear sides  109</span> , are disposed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">notches  106</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper handle portion  11</span> . It can be seen in FIGS.  5 , 7  that the cutter assembly has been designed for being pushed and pulled on both its right and left sides such that the cutter assembly always moves in a straight path.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      As can be seen in FIG. 7, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">sidewall  15</span> A shown partly in cutaway has a forward generally rectangular notched area. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">Sidewall  15</span> C is a duplicate of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">side wall  15</span> A and is spaced therefrom by the width of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">element  15</span> B of the upper portion. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">heretofore referenced notches  106</span>  are at the front lower comer of each of  15 A and  15 C. The small areas of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">sidewalls  15</span> A, C that separate the leading edges of the sidewalls are designated the noses and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem113">bears reference numerals  113</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem107">trailing edges  107</span> , of the notches, which are generally parallel to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105">leading edges  105</span>  of the notches. Note how the t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">ails (rear sections)  108</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutter assembly  36</span> , are disposed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">notches  106</span>  between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105">leading edges  105</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem113">noses  113</span>  of the sidewalls and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem107">trailing edges  107</span>  of the notches,  106 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIG. 19 is a bottom plan view with the elevation setter removed. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">reinforcing annulus  50</span> , which includes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">aperture  31</span>  wherein the elevation setter resides, is seen. In this figure also shows an area in which is a residence for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">base  24</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">elevation setter  21</span>  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">base  24</span>  is raised upwardly and is in contact the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">nail holder  28</span> , such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">base  24</span>  can be flush with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">base  13</span> B of the lower handle portion as per FIG.  5 .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SIZING TOOL  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In FIG. 18, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">sizing tool  80</span>  is disclosed, which can be made of plastic or metal and which preferably should be employed with the apparatus of this invention when a preset length of nail to be worn is desired. This accessory is not necessary for the operation of the apparatus of this invention. This tool includes a series of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem81">steps  81</span>  which has nine steps each corresponding to a preset uniform length increases of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">{fraction (1</span>/10)} inch elevation over the previous step. However millimeter increments can also be employed. The first step of the sizing tool is referenced as <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">size  2</span>  and the last step is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">size  9</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">Size  1</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">size  10</span>  have not been seen in this tool. It automatically has <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">size  1</span>  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">base  24</span>  of the elevation setter is in contact with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">nail holder  28</span> , as per FIG. 5, and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">size  10</span>  means the whole length of the nail. Thus, the nail wearer just needs to tell manicurist size number of nail to be worn, ten nails would be cut the same even length by using this tool in conjunction with the apparatus of this invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In FIG. 17 which shows the sizing tool it is disposed adjacent the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">elevation setter  21</span>  of the apparatus of this invention. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">Size  4</span>  is supposed for the desired size of the nail to be worn and the setting of the size has been accomplished. The next step is to remove the sizing tool off of the apparatus.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      To set a size, one holds the device in the palm, with the thumb presses downwardly on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">nut  25</span>  per FIG.  13 . The sizing tool is inserted between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">base  24</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">nail holder  28</span> . Pressure is applied by the thumb on the head of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">set screw  18</span>  while the index finger pushes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">base  24</span>  of the elevation setter upwardly until either side of the sizing tool is in contact with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">base  24</span>  and the nail holder FIG.  17 . When the setting of a size has been accomplished the elevation setter can not move discussed previously and as such each nail inserted for trimming will be cut a finite uniform length.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Once the length has been set by the use of the sizing tool, in conjunction with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">elevation setter  21</span> , a nail such as  95  disposed on a person&#39;s finger can be positioned for trimming. The nail is inserted as shown in FIG. 12 into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">nail ho<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">lder unit  28</span> &#39;s slot  30</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">base  24</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">setter  21</span>  is in contact with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem97">finger tip  97</span> , a downward force is applied to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper handle  11</span> , the nail has been cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is also to be seen that it is not necessary to use the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">sizing tool  80</span>  of FIG. 18 shown in use in FIG. 17 in conjunction with this apparatus. Indeed, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">base  24</span>  of the elevation setter may be urged maximally upward to its original position per FIG. 5 in the manner previously recited pertaining to the application of pressure on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">retention screw  18</span> ; the nail is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">inserted into slot  30</span>  as per the length desired, the thumb presses on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">nut  25</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">elevation setter  21</span>  until the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">base  24</span>  is in contact with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem97">tip  97</span>  of the FIG. 96 as per FIG. 12. A special size of the nail to be worn has been set and the cutting operation begun.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      OPERATION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      In FIG. 7, note how the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper handle portion  11</span>  connects to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutter assembly  36</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem113">noses  113</span>  are inserted through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">recesses  38</span> R of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">blade  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">tails  108</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">blade  36</span>  are disposed into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">notches  106</span> , it can be seen in FIG. 6 and 13. When the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper handle portion  11</span>  is squeezed with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">lower portion  12</span> , such that the upper portion pivots downwardly the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem107">trailing edges  107</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">notches  106</span>  impact the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem109">rear sides  109</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">sections  108</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutter assembly  36</span>  to help push the cutter assembly forward and the blade, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">edge  39</span>  cuts nail which is inserted in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">slot  30</span> . During this time the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">coil spring  43</span>  is compressed as per FIG.  13 . Upon release of the grip, the coil spring relaxes and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">upper portion  11</span>  returns from whence it came. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem105">leading edges  105</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111">noses urge front sides  111</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem108">sections  108</span>  rearwardly and the cutter assembly moves back to its original position and the cut is completed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      When in the closed position the upper handle is at about a 33 degree position as opposed to the 45 degree at rest position. When squeezed, the lower handle retracts into the upper handle and the cutter assembly moves forward to make the cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      CUTTER BLADE REPLACEMENT  </p>
                    
                        <p>      From time to time it will be necessary to take the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">apparatus  10</span>  apart to either or both clean the apparatus or to replace the cutter blade. In order to one or both of these operations, it is first necessary to remove the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">nut  25</span>  from the elevation setter. Press the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">shaft  23</span>  downwardly and remove it by pulling it out the bottom or underside of the apparatus. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">Open jaw  19</span>  maximally. Remove the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">spring  51</span>  and its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">washer  117</span> . Next, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">remove screw  61</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">lock washer  62</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">Undo bolt  50</span>  (FIG.  6 ), and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">remove screw  35</span> , (FIG.  2 ). Pull and remove the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">nail holder unit  28</span> . Then squeeze the two handle portions to urge the blade forwardly for removal, and then remove.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Insert a new blade, relax the grip on the handles such that they can assume the at rest position. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">Reinsert nail holder  28</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">reapply screw  35</span> , and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">bolt  50</span> . As the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">bolt  50</span>  is being threaded into position, one should squeeze and release the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">handle portions  11</span> ,  12 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">until blade  36</span>  moves with ease. Reapply the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">lock washer  62</span>  per FIG. 11 in correct alignment with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem55">gear  55</span> . <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">Reapply screw  61</span>  through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">washer  62</span>  and tighten into place. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem117">Reapply washer  117</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">spring  51</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Close the jaw from the position in FIG. 6 to the position of FIG.  16 . Make sure that the post of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">screw  18</span>  and the post of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">screw  <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">35</span>  fit into spring  51</span>  per FIG.  5 . Using one&#39;s fingers to retain the jaw in the down position per FIG. 1, insert the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">shaft  23</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">elevation setter  21</span>  upwardly through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">aperture  31</span>  in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">bolt  50</span>  per FIG.  5 . Re-thread the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">bolt  25</span>  on to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">shaft  23</span>  to complete the re-assembly process.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is to be understood that the leading and trailing edges of the notches of the upper handle are only engaged part of the time. Thus the blade can be removed when the handles are fully squeezed together, because due to the articulation of the upper handle, the leading edge of the notches rise out of engagement with the cutter assembly, to an above blade position, making for easy forward withdrawal.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is seen that I have developed an improved nail trimmer designed especially for artificial nails. This apparatus can be set to cut a series of applied nails to a uniform length over the entire hand due to the presence of the elevation setter - a feature not found in other nail trimmers. This unit makes a round or straight cut most befitting an expensive artificial nail and thus avoids chipping and straggly cuts. The cutter assembly slides along the upper surface of the nail holder during the cutting operation, while the nail holder prevents the nail from being bent during the cutting operation thus ensuring a neat straight through arcuate cut. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">cutter blade  36</span>  moves from the rear of and above the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">slot  30</span> , across the entire slot, and closes off the slot during the point of impact with the nail inserted in said slot.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The apparatus is preferably made of stainless steel for health and safety reasons. Of course, high impact plastic can also be employed for many of the components of this invention. Other metal may also be employed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Since certain changes may be made in the described apparatus without departing from the scope of the invention herein involved, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description and shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. </p>
