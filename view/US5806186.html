                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A combined toe and finger nail clipper having a common metal strip with a toe nail cutting edge at one end and a finger nail cutting edge at the opposite end. Mating nail cutting edges are at the ends of two additional metal strips which are each welded above and below at opposite ends of the common metal strip. A pair of vertical retaining posts located at each end of the nail clipping unit hold lever arms which can be stored in the flat position or rotated around and put into the use position as in conventional nail clippers. In this way a manufacturer can produce a combined toe and finger nail clipper more economically than two separate nail clippers and the user can store the combined nail clipper in a smaller space without worrying about locating two separate clippers. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> FIELD OF INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates to nail clippers and more specifically to a combination toe nail and finger nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      BACKGROUND OF INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Nail clippers in a variety of designs have been in existence for many years. Nail clippers of different sizes with different size cutting heads have been developed for both toe nails and finger nails. Since toe nails, especially the big toe, tend to be larger than finger nails, a larger clipper has been developed for toe nails whereas a smaller clipper is commonly used for finger nails. Many people are forced to purchase, own and keep track of two nail clippers. It would appear that there is a need for a single nail clipper which performs both functions of a toe nail clipper and a finger nail clipper and is less expensive to manufacture than two separate nail clippers.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      It is the object of the present invention to solve the above stated problem by providing a single nail clipper which has a toe nail cutting head at one end and a finger nail cutting head at the opposite end. This is accomplished by providing a sharpened nail cutting edge at either end of a first flat metal strip. A small finger nail clipping cutting edge is at one end and a larger toe nail cutting edge is at the opposite end. A second metal strip is welded at one end to the first metal strip. The second metal strip has a toe nail cutting edge at the opposite end. The first and second strip form a V shape with the bottom of the V being the welded end and the top of the V being the toe nail cutting end where the toe nail cutting edges face each other. A third metal strip is welded to the first metal strip on the opposite side to the second metal strip. This third strip has a finger nail cutting edge at one end and faces a mating finger nail cutting edge located at one end of the first metal strip. Vertical posts are located at each end of the nail clipping assembly and a swingable lever like arm is fastened to each vertical post and operate in typical nail clipper fashion where in one position the lever arm lays flat against the main body of the clipper and when swung and flipped forms a lever arm for applying pressure to the free moving cutting blade. In this way the present invention provides a new and improved nail clipping device which combines a toe nail clipper and a finger nail clipper which can be manufactured more economically than two separate nail clippers and which also is more convenient for a person to store and use. The drawings below show a detailed description of the preferred embodiment, however, it is to be understood that there may be other embodiments which differ somewhat from the preferred embodiment but which, never the less, are embodied within the spirit of the present invention and would be obvious to one versed in the stated of the art.  </p>
