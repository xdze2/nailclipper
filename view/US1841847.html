                        <p>   rihe device as shown in the drafw&#39;ings comprises a base or main handle member l and a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> Vco-operating lever handle member 2</span>, both termed up out ci sheet metal.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   rThe base member l is provided between its ends with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> pair orp 11p-standing ears 3</span> ising from its<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> side walls 4</span> and pierced to receive a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> connecting pivot pin 5</span>, the torward end of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> handle member 2</span> being provided with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> depending ears 6</span> which are liliewise pierced to receive the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> pivot pin 5</span> and the two members l and 2 are thus pivotally mounted in the relation of handles ot a pair of pliers. These handle members are normally held separated, as shown in Figs. 2 and 6, by a.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> long tlat spring 7</span> which is arranged between the handles.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">   </p>
                    
                        <p>   rlhe spring 7</span> is held in place between the handles by the engagement of a bendable tongue S at the free rear end ot the handle member l, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> rear end 9</span> of the spring being formed int-o a hook, as shown, for engagement beneath the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8"> tongue 8</span>. The lower part l0 ot the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9"> hook 9</span> forms a ulcrum upon which the spring is supported for its resilient action.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The opposite end portion of the spring is bent upwardly to form a shoulder ll for contact with the lower side oil the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> handle mem ber 2</span> just to the rear ot the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> pivot 5</span> and opera es to normally hold the handles separated, as shown.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The tree end l2 of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> spring 7</span> extends forwardly into the head part 13 or&#34;. the device and has a function which will be described later.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  rlhe head part 13 of the device comprises trl &#39;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> wall 24</span> pierced to receive the pivot pin a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem111"> forward e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">xtension 111</span> ot base handle member 1</span>, which is somewhat cup-shaped, haring a peripheral Lip-standing wall .l5 with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> liat or horizontal edge 16</span>, and forms the lower jaw member of the device. is to be noted that the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> side walls el ot tl e base member 1</span>, which make this member channel shaped in cross-section extend forward and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> merge into wall 15</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> extension or lower Yjaw 14</span>. This construction is very strong and light and the metal is the best form to prevent any distortion of the member by the torce applied to the cutters. rl`his lower part 1l; carries a fixed centi. cuide member l?.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As shown, the guide member comprisesI a tubular part 18 which is intfrnally screwthreaded to receive a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19"> fastening screw 19</span> entering through the botom of the member lll, and an upper head part 2U provided with two up-standing ear` 2l pierced to receive a horizontal pivot pin Upon the pin is pivotally mounted an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem223"> upper aw member 223</span> which, similar to the lower jaw meml&#39;ier, is somewhat cupwshaped, having a peripheral e2, and has a lower` edge opposed to the flat upper edge lll or&#34; the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15"> lower j aw 15</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> upper jaw member 28</span> being cup or cap shaped serves to enclose and cover up the working parts between the jaws, thus presenting a smoothly finished device of pleasing appearance.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This lower edge oi the unper aw member is not fiat like the opposed edge oi&#39;A the lower member but is Atorni-elfi and adapted to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> provide fulcrum points 25</span> for applying the cutting or operating pressure.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> pivot pin 22</span> is located to the rear of the center of the cutters and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25"> iii&#39;ilcrum or pressure points 25</span>/ are arranged slightly in front of the center oit &#39;the cutters in the best relation for applying the pressure to the cutters.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The upper member&#39; is adapted to be swmig on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> pivot pin 22</span> by the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> upper handle member 2</span>, the handle member when swung down as shown in dotted lines in 1*&#34; g. 5, being adapted to swing the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26"> rear end 26</span> ot4 the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> jaw 23</span> upwardly and consequently its forward part downwardl&#39; j.7 towards the lower jaw member. &#39;l`o eiiiect this movement the rear part 2G of the upper jaw member e):- tends over the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> forward end 2</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> handle member 2</span>, as best shown in Fig. 6, and the two are formed to provide sliding engage ment to permit the necessary relative movement during operation. As the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> handle member 2</span> is swung down, the upper jaw is swung to the dotted position shown in Fig. 6, that is, its forward part is swung down towarfi the lower jaw member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Between these two jaw members are arranged a pair of cutters comprising a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> lower cutter member 27</span> and an upper cutter&#39;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> member 28</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   These cutters are flat disk-like members centrally mounted on the central,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> vertical guide member 18</span> to rotate. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> upper cutter 28</span> is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> central bearing nozzle 29</span> for rotation and up and down movementon the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> guide member 18</span>, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem27"> lower cutter 27</span> is keyed to the upper cutter for rotation therewith by key projection 8O rigid with the lower cutter and projecting up alongside of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> guide member 18</span> and passing through a notch 3l in the inner edge ot the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> upper cutter 28</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Between the cutters 2T and 28 and surrounding the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> guide 18</span> is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> coiled spring 32</span> which tends to keep the cutters separated and against the tension of which the cutters are forced toward each other for use in clipping nails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The cutters have been described as being flat disk-lille members but their<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33"> peripheries 33</span> are turned toward each other and are formed into a plurality of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> re-entrantcurves 34</span> ot different radii, as best shown in Figs. 7 and 8, thereby `forming outwardly extending projecting portions between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31"> curves 31</span>. The inwardly curved parts of the edges ot the cutters are beveled on theirI inner sides to<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> form cutting edges 36</span>. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35"> outwardly extending projecting portions 35</span> between the cutting edges Si() are oppositely curved or rounded and the beveling is extended onto the ends of these parts thus extending the ends of the cutting edges in slightly reversed curves, but the middle portions oi these outwardly extending parts are not completely beveled; thus provid<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">ing flat shoulders or contacting surfaces 37</span> which effectively prevent the opposed cutting edges of the cutters bruising and dulling each other in the use of the device.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The reverse curved form ot&#39; the ends of the cutting edges prevent the leaving of uncut or unsevered parts when clipping the nails. In other words, by this means the leaving oit&#39; snags or partly severed pieces is prevented.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The peripheral walls ot the cutters are complete and when the cutting edges are pressed together, the space within the cutters is a closed space in which the clipped oli&#39; portions of the nails are held until the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> handle 2</span> is allowed to recede from its pressed down position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This is of advantage as the clippings can be retained in the device and deposited or re moved at will and prevents the scattering of the clippings where not desired.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As shown, the re-entrant curved parts of the cutters are of&#39; different sizes and, preterably, are five in number, as shown, so that one is setdirectly opposite to the handles or on the end of the device, the next adjacent curves will be set one on each side and in front of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> pivot pin 22</span>, the cutting edges of these two side portions being thus located about half way between the forward cutting edges and the pivot pin.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the use of the device, either the cutting edges at the outer end of the device can be used or the cutting edges at either side.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As explained before, the upper&#39;<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> jaw 23</span> is peculiarly formed at its periphery which is opposed to the periphery of the lower jaw. This peculiar formation consists in cutting away the forward part of this periphery as shown at 38 to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem39">provide rounded hearing or fulcrum points 39</span>, one on each side substantially midway between the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> pivot pin 22</span> and the forward edge of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> aw 23</span>. These bea-ring or fulcrum points bear on the upper cutter and force it with great power towards the lower cutter to accomplish the cutting action.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> upper jaw 23</span> is cut away as describer it will not bear on the forward part of the upper cutter when it is desired to use the forward pair of edges. For the purpose of arranging the device so that the force can be applied directly to the forward pair of itting edges, there is provided a movable abutment consisting of an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> arm 40</span> pivotally mounted on the underside of the upper jaw at el, Fig. l0, and arranged to swing around the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42"> forward end 42</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> jaw member 23</span> and adapted to be swung to a mid-position, as shown in full lines, Fig. l0, when it is desired to use the end cutting edges and to be swung around to one side or the other, as shown in dotted lines, Fig. l0, out of the way when it is desired to use the side cutting edges.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The several cutting edges are madeY of different radii for use on different sizes of nails and may be made of various shapes to produce trimmed nails of different shapes as fashion may dictate.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   ris best shown in F ig. 7, the sides of the lower handle member neXt the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> pivot 5</span> are formed inwardly to receive the ears on the upper handle member and present a neat `linished appearance. It should be noted that the edges of the handle members are formed inwardly toward each other, for the purpose cf providing a maximum of rigidity to withstand the strains of use, and to present a smooth and iinished appearance.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   rI`he turned in edges of the lower handle member prevent the lateral displacement of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> spring 7</span>.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> forward end 12</span> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> spring 7</span> is extended over the rear edge of the cutters and when the device is operated to close the cutters, this forward end of the spring tends to apply a strong yielding pressure on the rear dge of the upper cutter to balance the cutving pressure applied by the upper jaw and has prevent any cramping of the upper cutter upon the central guide member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The central portion of the lower cutter&#39; 27 is depressed as shown at 43 to form a seat for the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> spring 36</span> and the upper end of the spring` surrounds the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> nozzle 29</span> on the upper cutter.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The modiiiedstructure shown in Figs. ll and l2 is only modified as regards the means for applying` the cutting pressure. In this form the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23"> upper jaw member 23</span> is replaced by a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> lever 44</span>, the rear portion ofwhich is engaged by the upper handle member as in the form described, but the forward end is formed intotwc segmental toothed gears et central&#39;to the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> pivot 22</span>, and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> upper cutter 28</span> carries a boX-like central housing d6 formed on its inner wall with verti<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">cally disposed co-operating toothed racks 47</span>. It will readily be understood that when the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> handle 2</span> is pressed down or toward the other, the upper cutter will be forced toward the o posite cutter through the medium of the segmental gears and racks. In this modified form, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> main spring 7</span> acts in the same manner as before to apply a cutter closing pressure back of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> pivot pin 22</span>, as before.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As many modifications of the invention will readily occur to those skilled in the art, I do not limit or confine the invention to the specific details of construction herein shown and described.   </p>
