(Cl. fad-2n) AhE&#39;lFRACT 0F THE BESCLQSURE This disclosure pertains to a conventional fingernail clipper wherein a flexible wiping member is secured for rotation with the pin of the clipper when the pressure lever of the clipper is rotated from its closed carrying position to an open position ready for operation by the user. The wiping member may also be of such a material and construction that the cutting edges of the clipper blade members are honed by the wiping member to sharpen the cutting edges. Furthermore, the disclosure sets forth a resilient pin, either in the form having a longitudinal slot with resilient bifurcations or a hollow cylindrical member with longitudinally extending indexing flanges, which cooperate with appropriate openings in the blade member to releasably index the lever means in its closed carrying position or open operating position so that the lever does not pivot upon operation thereof. Such indexing means may alternatively be provided by appropriate projections and indents on the internal portion of the head of the pin and the undersurface of the bottom blade member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Background of the invention Field of the inventi0n.The field of the invention is basically cutting devices and more particularly such devices which utilize a pair of resilient blade members forced into cutting position by operation of a lever.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Description of prior art-The prior art involves the standard fingernail clipper which utilizes a pair of coopcrating cutting blades forced into operation by a lever anchored on a pin extending through the cutting blades. When the lever is in open operating position and the clippers are in the hand of the user, pressure applied by the thumb of the user is at an angle often resulting in pivoting of the lever away from its completely open operating position. Thus, the force available for effecting a cutting operation is diminished.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   While prior art clippers have utilized a clip or groove in the upper surface of the blade member to accommodate the end of the lever when the lever is pivoted to closed position; and, while other prior art clippers have utilized means on the lever and blade to prevent rotation of the lever when it is in the open operating position insofar as is known, no such means has been provided to prevent rotation of the lever both when it is in open operating position and when it is in closed position, nor has such means been associated with the pin.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Furthermore, after the cutting operation is effected the nail which has been sheared falls between the blade members and due to the construction of the blade members and cutting means thereon, the nail or other debris which has been sheared remains between the blade members and can prevent the blade members from being forced together to perform the next cutting operation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Summary of the invention This invention relates to a cutting device having a pair of blade members secured together at one end with the other ends of the blade members being spaced apart and having cutting means which cooperate to perform a cutting operation when moved toward each other. A pin means extends through the blade members adjacent the cutting means thereof and has a pressure lever secured thereto for rotation while being movable in a pivotal relationship with respect to the pin to apply operating pressure to one of the cutting blades. A flexible wiping, cleaning, and/ or honing device is associated with the pin means and is rotatable therewith upon rotation of the lever to either wipe debris from between the blades or to provide honing of the cutting means of the blades. This automatic Wiping of the debris (such as a sheared fingernail) upon rotation of the operating lever eliminates the user being required to strike the clipper sharply against the users hand or other object in an attempt to jar loose or free the retained debris.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another concept of this invention involves indexing means associated with at least one of the blade members and the pin means to releasably position the operating lever in the desired open or closed position. The indexing of the lever member in either the open or closed position, like operation of the wiping member, occurs automatically upon rotation of the lever and these changes have been made with a minimum of additional cost to the manu facturer of the clipper.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In summary, it is an object of this invention to provide a low cost automatically operable wiping member to clean debris from the cutting blades and also to provide low cost means for indexing the operating lever in its open and/or closed position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   These and other objects and advantages of this in vention will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.   </p>

                        <p>  Description of the preferred embodiments Referring now more particularly to the drawings, a fingernail clipper designated generally at 1th is shown assembled in FIGS. 1 and 2 and comprises a first or bottom elongated blade member 12, i<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">llustrated in FIG. 3, and a second or top el</span>ongated blade member 14, simil<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">ar in construction to blade member 12 an</span>d illustrated in FIG. 4. The<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> top blade membe</span>r 14 ditl&#39;ers slightly from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> the bottom blade me</span>mber 12 in that the blade is be<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">nt adjacent one end so </span>that when the top and bottom members are aligned with their one end placed in engagement and firmly secured in such a position by any suitable means such as a tack weld 16, the opposite ends of the blade m<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">embers 12 and</span> 14 are positioned in spac<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ed rela<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">tionship.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Cut</span></span>ting means is provided on the spaced ends or&#34; the blade members 12 and 14. Such cutting means ta<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">kes the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> form of mating c</span></span>utting edges 13 and provided by angula<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">rly bending the ends of </span>blade members 12 and 14 respectively and honin<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">g such <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">to a sharp edge. </span></span>  </p>
                    
                        <p>   Adjacent the cutting edges 18 and 2% of the blade members, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">the bla<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">de members are p</span></span>rovided with openings for the reception of a pin 22. which is shown most clearly in FIGS. 6<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> and 7.</span> The opening 24 in the top member is, in this embod<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">iment, of c</span>ircular configuration. Whereas, the opening 26 in the bottom member is generally e<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lliptical i</span>n shape. Thus, the opening 26 has intermediate arcuate surfaces 2<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">8 construct</span>ed f<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">rom one radius and end arcuate su</span>rfaces 30 and 32 displaced furth<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">er from<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> the center of the ellip</span></span>tical opening than the intermediate arcuate surfaces 28.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The pin <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">22 comprises a head portion 34 an</span>d a body <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">portion</span> 36 and is a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">dapted to extend</span> throu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">gh the openings </span>24 and 26 and protrude above the top <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">blade 1<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">4. The body </span></span>portion 36 of the pin w<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">hich extends </span>above<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> the top blade 1</span>4 is provided with receiving means <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">in the form o</span>f a booklike opening 38 which is adapted to cooper<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">ate with a lever 40 </span>which is illustrated in FIG. 5.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   M<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">ore parti</span>cularly, the lever 40 is an elongated member slightly short<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">er in len</span>gth than the blade members 12 and 14 and is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> bent o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">ver portion 42 ad</span></span>jacent one end thereof. The bent <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">over portio</span>n is apertured at 44 so as to provide a cross bar 46 which is sized to be received in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">the hook-like</span> opening 38 of the pin 2.2.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The l<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">ever 40 is provided w</span>ith a s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">tamped</span> arcuate pr<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">essure me</span>ans 48 adjacent the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48"> aperture 44 so that when the leve</span>r is attached<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44"> to the pin </span>22 the arcuate pressure means rests on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> upper </span>surface of the top blade 14 adjacent the cutting end of the b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">lade. With th</span>is construction, it is apparent that the lever is held in the hook-like opening 38 of the pin member by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">resiliency of the bla</span>de members 12 and 14 and when the lever is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">rotated<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> in a 360 arc the</span></span> pin which is fixed thereto for rotation also rotates 360. F<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem360">urthermore, the operable connection between </span>the lever and the pin is such that the lever may be pivoted or inverted from its closed position shown in FIG. 1 and then rotated to its open position shown in FIG. 2 while still being retained by the hook-like opening 38 due to the resiliency of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">the blade members.   </p>
                    
                        <p> </span>  As most clearly shown in FIG. 6, the pin 22 has a longitudinally extending slot 50 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">which f</span>orms b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">ifurcations 52 and S4 of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52"> the lowe</span>r end of the pin. The pin is</span> constructed of a material such that when the bifurcations are forced towards each other, due to the inherent resiliency, they tend to return to their original position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The head portion 34 of the pin and the undersurfac<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">e of blade membe</span>r 12 cooperates with each other to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">provide means fo</span>r preventing axial movement of the pin towards the second blade member and thus anchor the pin while still permitting rotation thereof.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Means is provided in association with the pin for automatic rotation therewith upon rotation of the lever 40 to clear debris from the area between<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40"> the blad</span>e members.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  More particularly, in this embodiment as shown in FIG. 8, a wiping member 56 of generally L-shaped constru<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">ction is placed i</span>n the slot 5b with the wiping portion protruding transversely therefrom. In this construction, as most clearly shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 the wiping member 56 is held against axial or pivo<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">tal movement from</span> the slot either by engagement with the top blade member or the bottom blade member and furthermore is securely held by the pin for rotation therewith.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The protruding portion of the wiping member 56 is greater in length than the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> displacement of </span>the pin 22 from the cutting edges 18 and 2d of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22"> blade </span>members s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">o that the wiping</span> member will extend into the corners of the cutting edges 18 and 20 and remove debris ther<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">efrom. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">For this purpose,</span></span> it is apparent that the wiping member 56 need be a flexible member and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> to this end the </span>wiping member may be of any resilient material such as rubber or plastic which will withstand the wear involved. It is apparent from viewing FTGS. 8 and 9 that the height of the wiping member 56 is greater than its width. Fu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">rthermore, the wi</span>ping member 56 may be of a suitable material<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56"> which, when run </span>across the cutting edges 18 and 29 will serve as a honing<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18"> device<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29"> and sharpen the </span></span>edges for further use.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring now to FIGS. 9, l0, and 11, the operation of the indexing means will become apparent. In FIG. 9 the heads of bifurcations 52 and 54 are positioned in engag<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">ement w<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">ith the end arcu</span></span>ate surfaces 3%) and 32, respectively,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> and the lever means is</span> in its closed carrying position as shown in FIG. 1. In such a position the bifurcations 52 and 54 are fully circumferenti<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">ally ex<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">panded and the r</span></span>esiliency of the bifurcations tend to index the lever in such closed position. When it is desired to move the lever 40 to the operating position shown in FI<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">G. 2, the</span> lever 40&#39; is first pivotally inverted and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">then rota</span>ted to the intermediate position shown in FIG. 10 wherein the bifurcations 52 and 54 have been compressed ag<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">ainst t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">he resiliency th</span></span>ereof. The lever 40 is further rotated another 90 to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">position </span>shown in FIG. 2 (and in dotted lines in FIG. 11) at which time the bifurcations 52 and 54 spring out into engagem<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">ent wit<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">h the end arcuat</span></span>e surfaces 32 and 30, respectively (<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">positio<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">ns being reversed from t</span></span>he closed position), to index the lever in its open position as shown in FIG. 2. Thus, when the user applies pressure to the lever member 46 to perform a cutting operation<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">, he can do so a</span>nd the lever will not rotate from its open position due to the resisting resiliency of the indexed bifurcations of the pin.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Refer now more particularly to the embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 12, where members similar to those described in the previous embodiment will be given like reference characters. The construction of the clipper in this embodiment is similar to the one previously described in that a pair of cutting blades 12 and 14 with cutting surfaces<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> 18 and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> 2b are adapted to</span></span> be o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">perated by a lever 4</span>0. The pin 58 differs from that shown i<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">n the pre</span>vious<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58"> embodi</span>ment in that the pin is not provided with a longitudinal slot but is of solid body construction with a circular head portion 60. The wiping member 62<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60"> can be secured to the pi</span>n 53 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">for rotation ther</span>ewith in any number of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53"> suitab</span>le manners, such as by adhesive bonding. In this embodiment the undersurface of the circular head portion 60 of the pin is provide<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">d with a pair of projecti</span>ons G4 which cooperate with conforming indents 66 provided on the undersur<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">face of the bottom bla</span>de member 12 so that the pin is resi<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">liently indexed in eith</span>er the open or closed position. It is apparent that the projections 64 and the indents 66 may be rever<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">sed so that the</span> project<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">ions are pr</span>ovided on the blade member and the indents provided in the pin head. Thus, when it is desired to rotate the lever 40, suitable rotational pressure will ov<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">ercome th</span>e resilient indexing to permit the same while suflicient resistance is provided to rotation during the cutting operation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring now to FIGS. l3l5, another embodiment of this invention is shown wherein alternative indexing means and wiper securing means is provided. More particularly, a pin 68 of generally hollow cylindrical configu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">ration </span>is provided. The cylinder is provided with a longitudinally extending opening 70 through wh<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">ich the wiping portion of a wiping m</span>ember 72 extends. The body portion of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">the wiping member</span> &#34;72 is of a cylindrical configuration conforming to that of the pin member in Which it is encased. For purposes of indexing the lever in the open and closed position, longitudinally extending flanges 74 are provid<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">ed adjacent the longitudinally exten</span>ding opening 70 and such f<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">langes cooperate with indents 76 dis</span>placed 180 on a circular opening<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> 78 pro<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180">vide</span>d in the botto</span>m bla<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">de member 12. If so </span>desired, the top<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12"> blade 14 may similarly</span> be provided with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">circular open</span>ing 78 and opposed indents 76. Th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">us, in operation, th</span>e fl<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">anges 74 are indexe</span>d in the indents 76 when <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">the lever i</span>s positioned in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76"> open or cl</span>osed position and by suitable rotational pressure the circumferential resiliency of the pin 68 is overcome to remove the flanges 74 fr<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">om the </span>indents 76 to permit rotat<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">ion of the </span>lever. Th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">e wiping me</span>mber 72 is firmly secured in the pin <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">68 since it is en</span>compassed thereby and is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">prohibi</span>ted from axial movement with respect thereto by engagement of the wiping portion with the top or bottom blade.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Referring now to the embodiment of this invention shown in FIGS. 16 and 17, the blade members 12 and 14 are again operated by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">the lev<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">er 40 but in this</span></span> case the pin 8% is triang<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">ular in c</span>ross-section and coop<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">erates</span> with a triangular opening 82 in a wiping member 84 so<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82"> that the wiping membe</span>r rot<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">ates as a unit th</span>erewith. In this case the blade members 12 and 14 are provided with circ<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">ular op<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">enings to accommo</span></span>date the pin 80. To aid the wiping action of the wiping<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80"> member</span> 84 upon rotation of the lever 40<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem84">, the wiping memb</span>er is provided with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">n apertur</span>e, in this case circular, to permit additional flexibility of the wiping portion of the member and enable it to more easily clean the corners of the cutting edges 18 and 20.   </p>
