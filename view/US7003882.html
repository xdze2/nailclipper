                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A nail clipper  10  includes a fixed blade member  2  and a movable blade member  3 . The fixed blade member  2  in a form of a curved plate has a curved face for enabling a finger tip F to be contacted with the curved face, a nail insertion groove  23  in an arc shape which is formed in this curved face, and a cutting edge  24  which is provided at a backward lower edge of the nail insertion groove  23 . The movable blade member  3  has a curved face  33  so as to slide up and down along a back face of the fixed blade member  2 , and a cutting edge  34  which is formed at a lower edge of the curved face  33  in a curved shape in correspondence with the above mentioned cutting edge  24 . When the movable blade member  3  has slid downward, the cutting edge  34  is adapted to cut a part of a nail n which is protruded from the nail insertion groove  23. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    1. Field of the Invention  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The present invention relates to a nail clipper, and more particularly, to the nail clipper which can be easily used even by a visually handicapped person, and can safely and reliably cut nails without cutting too deep, in a dark condition or in case of cutting nails of a child.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    2. Description of the Related Art  </p>
                    
                        <p>    A generally known nail clipper of a conventional type includes two levers which are connected at their backward ends to be usually kept open in a bifurcate shape. Respective tip ends of the levers are bent in an L shape to form nail cutting portions which are opposed to each other. The nail cutting portions are curved in a concave shape and provided with nail cutting edges at respective tip ends of the nail cutting portions. One (a lower one) of the levers has a support pole uprightly provided thereon, and a forward end of a depressing lever is pivotally held on the support pole. By operating the depressing lever, the other lever is resiliently closed by an action of leverage by way of a cam mechanism provided on the depressing lever, thereby to press and cut a nail between the above mentioned upper and lower nail cutting edges. Moreover, there have been some nail clippers of a type that a scatter preventing cover is attached to side faces of one or both the levers, in order to prevent nail chips which have been cut from scattering.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    In the conventional nail clipper as described above, the nail cutting edges are horizontally formed. However, there has been proposed such a nail clipper that the nail cutting edges are curved so as to correspond with a curvature of an upper face of the nail, as disclosed in Japanese publication of the registered Utility Model No. 3075179.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    The conventional nail clipper has been so constructed, as described above, that the nail can be cut by depressing the depressing lever in a state where the nail tip is inserted between the upper and lower nail cutting edges. Therefore, on occasion of using the conventional nail clipper, it has been necessary to position the nail clipper while visually confirming a length of the nail to be cut, and it has been extremely difficult for a visually handicapped person to use the conventional nail clipper.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Moreover, since the upper and lower nail cutting edges are kept open widely in the conventional nail clipper, there has been such an anxiety that even a flesh part of a finger tip may be inserted between the nail cutting edges, and in case where the nail clipper has been used in a dark condition or in case of cutting nails of a child, the nails may be cut too deep or the flesh part of the finger tip may be injured.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    An object of the invention is to overcome such drawbacks of the conventional nail clipper, and to provide a nail clipper which can be easily used even by a visually handicapped person, and can safely and reliably cut nails without cutting too deep, even in a dark condition and in case of cutting nails of a child.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>    In order to attain the above described object, there is provided according to the present invention, a nail clipper comprising a fixed blade member in a shape of a curved plate including a curved face which is formed in a concave shape for enabling a finger tip to be contacted therewith, a nail insertion groove in an arc shape which is formed in the curved face, and a cutting edge which is provided at a backward lower edge of the nail insertion groove, and a movable blade member including a curved face which is formed so that the movable blade member can slide up and down along a back face of the fixed blade member, and a cutting edge provided at a lower edge of the curved face and having a curved shape in correspondence with the cutting edge of the fixed blade member, characterized in that the movable blade member is slid downward thereby to cut a part of the nail which is protruded from the nail insertion groove, in cooperation with the fixed blade member.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    In this case, according to a further aspect of the present invention, the fixed blade member is mounted on a nail clipper body which is provided with a first operating arm, and the movable blade member is mounted on the nail clipper body so as to slidably move up and down, the nail clipper further including a second operating arm which is pivotally fixed to the nail clipper body at its forward end and arranged so as to be opposed to the first operating arm for making the movable blade member slide downward, and spring means for usually urging the movable blade member in a direction of moving upward.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    On occasion of using the nail clipper having the above described structure, the finger tip is slid along the curved face of the fixed blade member to arrive at the nail insertion groove, and the nail tip is inserted into the nail insertion groove, whereby only the part of the nail to be cut can be protruded inwardly from the nail insertion groove. By depressing the first and second operating arms in this state to each other so as to be closed, the movable blade member will be depressed by the second operating arm, and the part of the nail protruded from the nail insertion groove can be reliably cut by the cooperation of the cutting edge of the fixed blade member and the cutting edge of the movable blade member.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Because the nail clipper in this invention is constructed in such a manner that the finger tip can be slid along the curved face of the fixed blade member to arrive at the nail insertion groove, for enabling the nail tip to be inserted into the nail insertion groove, even the visually handicapped person can easily operate the nail clipper. Further, the nail clipper can be extremely safely used, because only the part of the nail to be cut is protruded from the nail insertion groove.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Preferably, the fixed blade member is detachably mounted on the nail clipper body, although the fixed blade member may be fixed to the nail clipper body. By designing the fixed blade member as a separate component in this manner, it is easy to manufacture the blade member, and at the same time, it is possible to exchange the fixed blade member. Accordingly, the fixed blade member can be exchanged when the cutting edge has lost its sharpness. Besides, a plurality of the fixed blade members formed of sheet metals having different thickness may be prepared in advance, and by exchanging these fixed blade members, a length of the nail to be cut can be selected.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Moreover, in the nail clipper according to the invention, a nail chip reservoir having an opening for disposal may be provided inside the nail clipper body. By providing this nail chip reservoir in this manner, the nail chips can be prevented from scattering.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    According to a further aspect of the invention, the cutting edge of the movable blade member is slightly inclined with respect to the cutting edge of the fixed blade member, whereby the nail is sequentially cut from one end to the other end of the cutting edge of the fixed blade member by a downward movement of the movable blade member. As the results, the above mentioned second operating arm can be operated with a small depressing force.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    According to a still further aspect of the invention, a slanted face is formed at an opening edge of the nail insertion groove from a lower edge of an inlet up to the cutting edge at the backward end, whereby the nail insertion groove is substantially made narrow at the backward end. By designing the nail insertion groove in this manner, the finger tip is guided along the slanted face, and the part of the nail to be cut will be protruded backward from the nail insertion groove without being affected by thickness of the fixed blade member, and can be reliably cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Preferably, the first operating arm and the second operating arm are provided with ring-like portions to be secured by inserting a user&#39;s fingers, at their respective backward end parts. As the results, it is possible to operate the nail clipper according to the invention in a manner of operating a pair of scissors.  </p>

                        <p>    <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">The above described one operating arm  14</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">other operating arm  4</span>  may be so designed that the backward ends thereof may be simply depressed, in the same manner as in the conventional nail clipper. In this embodiment however, in order to facilitate the operation, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">ring-like portions  8</span> ,  9  to be secured by inserting a user&#39;s fingers are respectively provided at backward ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">one operating arm  14</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">other operating arm  4</span> . Although these <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">ring-like portions  8</span> ,  9  are molded of synthetic resin as separate members, and are fixed to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">operating arms  14</span> ,  4  by screws in this embodiment, alternatively, the respective backward ends of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">operating arms  14</span> ,  4  may be formed longer, and maybe folded into a ring-like shape.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    In order to assemble the nail clipper having the above described structure, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">fixed blade member  2</span>  is inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">frame-like portion  11</span>  from the above, in such a manner that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">support portions  22</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">fixed blade member  2</span>  may be engaged in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">guide grooves  12</span>   a  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">frame-like portion  11</span> . Then, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">movable blade member  3</span>  is inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">frame-like portion  11</span>  from the above or below in such a manner that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">slide guide grooves  32</span>  may be engaged with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">guide ribs  12</span>   b  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">frame-like portion  11</span> . Thereafter, the forward end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">leaf spring  51</span>  is engaged in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">engaging groove  36</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">movable blade member  3</span>  to be secured, and the backward end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">leaf spring  51</span>  is fixed to the backward end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">one operating arm  14</span>  by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">screw  51</span>   a . In this manner, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">movable blade member  3</span>  will be resiliently held.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Then, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">forward end  41</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">other operating arm  4</span>  is pivotally secured by means of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">pivot pin  42</span>  which is received in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">pivot holes  12</span>   c  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">side walls  12</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">frame-like portion  11</span>  so as to freely rotate. Then, by fitting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">upper cover  6</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">bottom cover  7</span>  over the openings in the upper and lower faces of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">frame-like portion  11</span> , the assembling work will be completed.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    In case where the backward end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">leaf spring  51</span>  is so designed as to be fixed to the backward end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">one operating arm  14</span>  by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">screw  51</span>   a , as described above, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">leaf spring  51</span>  can be easily detached, and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">movable blade member  3</span>  can be exchanged. Moreover, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">screw  51</span>   a  may be used also as the screw for fixing the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">ring-like portion  8</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">one operating arm  14</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>    When the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span>  having the above described structure is actually used, the finger tip F is slid from the above along the curved face of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">fixed blade member  2</span>  to arrive at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">nail insertion groove  23</span> , and the nail tip is inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">nail insertion groove  23</span> , whereby only the part of the nail to be cut can be protruded backward from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">nail insertion groove  23</span> . By depressing the one and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">other operating arms  14</span> ,  4  in this state onto each other so as to be closed, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">movable blade member  3</span>  will be depressed with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">other operating arm  4</span> , whereby the part of the nail protruded from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">nail insertion groove  23</span>  can be reliably cut by the cooperation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">cutting edge  24</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">fixed blade member  2</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting edge  34</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">movable blade member  3</span> . The curved face of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">fixed blade member  2</span>  does not have such a curvature as to correspond with the shapes of all the finger tips, and so, it is necessary to cut the nail while the finger tip is sequentially turned in a horizontal direction.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Because the nail clipper according to the invention is constructed in such a manner that the finger tip F is slid along the curved face of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">fixed blade member  2</span>  to arrive at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">nail insertion groove  23</span> , and the nail tip is inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">nail insertion groove  23</span> , even a visually handicapped person can easily operate the nail clipper. Further, the nail clipper can be extremely safely used, because only the part of the nail to be cut is protruded from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">nail insertion groove  23</span>  and then cut.  </p>
                    
                        <p>    Although the present invention has been fully described by way of an example with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modification can be made within a scope of the present invention. </p>
