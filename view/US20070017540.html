                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A grip for a graspable item having a body and a handle connected to and extending outwardly away from the body. The grip includes a hollow core configured to slide onto the handle, and a hollow sleeve having a plurality of outwardly extending ribs disposed on the external surface of the sleeve. The sleeve is configured to slide onto the exterior of the core such that the core and the sleeve define a cavity therebetween. The grip further includes a quantity of a gel disposed within the cavity. The ends of the sleeve are sealed against the corresponding ends of the core to retain the gel within the cavity, and the gel allows the sleeve to deform to conform to the shape of a user&amp;#39;s hand when the handle of the graspable item is grasped by the user. </p>

                        <p>      FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]     The present disclosure is generally directed to devices having gel grip handles and, more particularly, to personal care products such as hair brushes and the like, and other graspable implements, having ribbed gel grip handles.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0003]     Hair brushes and hair brush handles are generally known in the art. These hair brushes, however, are inflexible and do not contour to an individual&#39;s hand while brushing or styling. Such inflexibility can cause strain and tension on the user&#39;s hands or wrists. Additionally, with prolonged usage of such hair brushes or handles, Carpal tunnel syndrome and hand/wrist strain may become apparent. Similarly, other hair care devices, accessories and personal care items are typically provided with rigid handles or body structures.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]     Efforts have been made to combat the inflexibility of hair brushes, with the use of gel or gel-filled handles, but a total solution providing comfort flexibility and an improved tactile feel has yet to be provided.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0005]     In one aspect, the invention is directed to a hair brush having a body having a plurality of outwardly extending bristles, a post connected to and extending outwardly away from the body, and a grip disposed on the post. The grip includes a hollow core configured to slide onto the post, and a hollow sleeve having a plurality of outwardly extending ribs disposed on the external surface of the sleeve, wherein the sleeve is configured to slide onto the exterior of the core such that the core and the sleeve define a cavity therebetween. The grip further includes a quantity of a gel disposed within the cavity, wherein the ends of the sleeve are sealed against the corresponding ends of the core to retain the gel within the cavity, and wherein the gel allows the sleeve to deform to conform to the shape of a user&#39;s hand when the grip is grasped by the user.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]     In another aspect, the invention is directed to a grip for a graspable item having a body and a handle connected to and extending outwardly away from the body. The grip includes a hollow core configured to slide onto the handle, and a hollow sleeve having a plurality of outwardly extending ribs disposed on the external surface of the sleeve. The sleeve is configured to slide onto the exterior of the core such that the core and the sleeve define a cavity therebetween. The grip further includes a quantity of a gel disposed within the cavity. The ends of the sleeve are sealed against the corresponding ends of the core to retain the gel within the cavity, and the gel allows the sleeve to deform to conform to the shape of a user&#39;s hand when the handle of the graspable item is grasped by the user.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]     In a further aspect, the invention is directed to a personal care item having a body, a post connected to and extending outwardly away from the body, and a grip disposed on the post. The grip includes a hollow core configured to slide onto the post, and a hollow sleeve having a plurality of outwardly extending ribs disposed on the external surface of the sleeve, wherein the sleeve is configured to slide onto the exterior of the core such that the core and the sleeve define a cavity therebetween. The grip further includes a quantity of a gel disposed within the cavity. The ends of the sleeve are sealed against the corresponding ends of the core to retain the gel within the cavity, and the gel allows the sleeve to deform to conform to the shape of a user&#39;s hand when the grip of the personal care item is grasped by the user.   </p>

                        <p>        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0029]     Although the following text sets forth a detailed description of numerous different embodiments of the invention, it should be understood that the legal scope of the invention is defined by the words of the claims set forth at the end of this patent. The detailed description is to be construed as exemplary only and does not describe every possible embodiment of the invention since describing every possible embodiment would be impractical, if not impossible. Numerous alternative embodiments could be implemented, using either current technology or technology developed after the filing date of this patent, which would still fall within the scope of the claims defining the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0030]     It should also be understood that, unless a term is expressly defined in this patent using the sentence “As used herein, the term ‘______’ is hereby defined to mean . . . ” or a similar sentence, there is no intent to limit the meaning of that term, either expressly or by implication, beyond its plain or ordinary meaning, and such term should not be interpreted to be limited in scope based on any statement made in any section of this patent (other than the language of the claims). To the extent that any term recited in the claims at the end of this patent is referred to in this patent in a manner consistent with a single meaning, that is done for sake of clarity only so as to not confuse the reader, and it is not intended that such claim term by limited, by implication or otherwise, to that single meaning. Finally, unless a claim element is defined by reciting the word “means” and a function without the recital of any structure, it is not intended that the scope of any claim element be interpreted based on the application of 35 U.S.C. § 112, sixth paragraph.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0031]     Referring now to the drawings and with specific reference to  FIG. 1 , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">hair brush  20</span>  having a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">body  22</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">handle  24</span>  is disclosed. As shown therein, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">first end  26</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">handle  24</span>  extends from a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">second end  28</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">body  22</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">body  22</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">head  30</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">brush  20</span>  having <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">bristles  32</span>  at a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">first end  34</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">body  22</span> . As illustrated in  FIGS. 4 and 5 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">head  30</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">brush  20</span>  may vary greatly including in size, shape and material. For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">head  30</span>  may be round, square, rectangular, oval or cylindrical in shape. Similarly, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">bristles  32</span>  may vary in size, length, flexibility, and material.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0032]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">handle  24</span> , as illustrated in  FIG. 1 , includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">cap  38</span>  disposed on the exterior thereof. As illustrated in further detail in  FIGS. 2 and 3 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">handle  24</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">narrow post  40</span>  extending away from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">head  30</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">hair brush  20</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">ribbed sleeve  36</span>  is disposed over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">post  40</span>  and is filled with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">silicone gel  42</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  extends along a majority of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">handle  24</span>  and provides flexibility of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">hair brush  20</span>  along with the ability to contour to a user&#39;s hand when gripped such that stresses and strains associated with the use of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">hair brush  20</span>  is reduced. Additionally, to further improve the grip and feel of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">handle  24</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  includes <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">undulations or ridges  44</span>  that provide the user with increased tactile sense and help with gripping. More specifically, as illustrated in  FIGS. 2 and 3 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  includes an outer surface having the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">ridges  44</span>  and an inner surface that, in combination with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">hollow core  46</span> , define a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">cavity  48</span>  for receiving the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">gel  42</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">core  46</span>  is configured to slide over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">post  40</span>  when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">hair brush  20</span>  is assembled.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0033]     A process for assembling the ribbed gel grip is illustrated in  FIGS. 6 and 7 . Referring to  FIG. 6 , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">core  46</span>  is further configured such that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  may be slid onto or otherwise engaged with the exterior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">core  46</span> . Once the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  is disposed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">core  46</span> , as seen in  FIG. 7 , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">neck ring  50</span>  may be placed over one end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  thereby compressing the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">ring  50</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">core  46</span>  to substantially seal the end of the grip to prevent leakage of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">gel  42</span>  disposed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">cavity  48</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">neck ring  50</span>  may fit snuggly on the end of the grip to seal the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">core  46</span> , or may be affixed with an additional adhesive or crimping, or otherwise secured to the end of the grip to ensure a tight, secure seal. The illustrated embodiment is one manner in which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  may be attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">core  46</span> , but the mechanism for attachment of the components may vary greatly and may include additional structure. For example, the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  may be dimensioned to tightly receive the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">core  46</span>  and engage the outer surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">core  46</span>  to seal the end of the grip. Still further, the end of the grip may be sealed with an adhesive, or with any other appropriate process for forming a seal between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">core  46</span> , such as heat sealing, sonic welding, embossment, mechanical locking geometry, such as snaps or grooves that create a friction lock between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">core  46</span> , and the like.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0034]     In the illustrated example, as a result of the placement of and engagement by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">neck ring  50</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">gel  42</span>  is prevented from exiting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">cavity  48</span> . After the seal is formed at the end of the grip, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">gel  42</span>  may be injected into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">cavity  48</span>  at the opposite end of the grip between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">core  46</span> . Once the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">gel  42</span>  is injected into the grip, the manner in which the grip is attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">body  22</span>  may vary greatly. In the illustrated embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">post  40</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">handle  24</span>  may be inserted into the hollow cylinder of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">core  46</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">neck ring  50</span>  being received into a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">neck  52</span>  on the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">handle  24</span>  proximate the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">head  30</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">brush  20</span> . Once the grip assembly is disposed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">post  40</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">cap  38</span>  may be attached to the end of the grip and/or the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">post  40</span> , thereby retaining the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">core  46</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">handle  24</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">cap  38</span>  may engage the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">post  40</span>  by snap fit, screw engagement or other connection mechanism. At the same time, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">cap  38</span>  may be configured to engage the proximate end of the grip to seal the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">cavity  48</span>  by forcing the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  against the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">core  46</span>  to substantially seal the end and prevent leakage of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">gel  42</span> . Alternatively, the end of the grip may be sealed by any other mechanism, such as those discussed above and possibly including an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">addition neck ring  50</span>  disposed on and engaging the end of the grip.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0035]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">gel  42</span>  may be a silicon gel as stated earlier, or may be replaced by or include other types of viscous materials that may allow the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  to conform to the contours of a user&#39;s hand when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">handle  24</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">brush  20</span>  is gripped. Similarly, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">gel  42</span>  may be varied in volume, viscosity, and/or density to achieve different feels when a user grips the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">handle  24</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  may also be constructed from a silicone material, or may be constructed from other materials such as thermoplastic elastomer, thermal plastic rubber and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), for example.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0036]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">ridges  44</span>  may be formed in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  during various types of molding processes. In one such process, the outer surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  includes the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">ridges  44</span> , whereas an inner surface of the outer wall is flat as seen in  FIG. 3 . Alternatively, as seen in  FIG. 2 , the inner surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  may be molded to include ridges corresponding to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">ridges  44</span>  on the outer surface. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">ridges  44</span>  may be oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">handle  24</span> , as illustrated in  FIGS. 1 and 2 , or may be oriented parallel in any other desired orientation with regard to the longitudinal axis. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">ridges or undulation  44</span>  may be formed/molded in other shapes, such as bumps, rings, swirls, nubbins, etc. In operation, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">gel filled handle  24</span>  having the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">ridges  44</span>  provides the user with a more comfortable grip on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">brush  20</span> . In addition, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">ridges  44</span>  provide increased tactile feel of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">brush  20</span> , and provide additional gripping assistance.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0037]      FIG. 8  illustrates an exploded view of an alternate configuration of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">hair brush  60</span>  wherein the core and sleeve substantially form the handle of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">hair brush  60</span> . Similar to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">hair brush  20</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">hair brush  20</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">head  62</span>  having an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">outwardly extending post  64</span>  to which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">core  66</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">sleeve  68</span>  are connected to form the handle of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">hair brush  60</span> . In this embodiment, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">post  64</span>  does not extend the entire length of the handle of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">hair brush  60</span> , but instead extends part way from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">head  62</span>  and is engaged within the interior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">core  66</span>  to secure the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">core  66</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">post  64</span>  in a manner described more fully below. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">hollow core  66</span>  is configured in a similar manner as the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">core  46</span> , and includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first neck  70</span>  having a reduced outer diameter and dimensioned to receive the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">post  64</span>  during assembly. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">core  66</span>  further includes <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">second neck  72</span>  disposed on the opposite end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">core  66</span>  from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first neck  70</span>  and having a reduced outer diameter with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem74">one or more annular ribs  74</span>  around the outer surface thereof to engage and retain an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">end cap  76</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">hair brush  60</span>  in a manner described more fully below.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0038]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">hollow sleeve  68</span>  is similar to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">sleeve  36</span>  and combines with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">core  66</span>  to define a cavity for receiving the gel. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">sleeve  68</span>  includes first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">second ends  78</span> ,  80  corresponding to the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">second necks  70</span> ,  72  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">core  66</span> , respectively, having reduced outer diameters and inner diameters dimensioned to correspond to the outer diameters of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">corresponding necks  70</span> ,  72 . In order to seal the cavity formed by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">core  66</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">sleeve  68</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">hair brush  60</span>  further includes <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82">neck rings  82</span> ,  84  similar to those described above and configured to compress the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">ends  78</span> ,  80  into engagement with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">necks  70</span> ,  72  to form substantially air and water tight seals preventing the gel from seeping out of the cavity. Of course, other sealing mechanisms such as those described above may be implemented an addition or as alternatives to the compression provided by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82">neck rings  82</span> ,  84  to seal the cavity.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0039]     The process for assembling the handle of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">hair brush  60</span>  may be similar to that described above for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">hair brush  20</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">sleeve  68</span>  may be slid onto or otherwise engaged with the exterior of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">core  66</span> , with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">first end  78</span>  disposed over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first neck  70</span> , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">second end  80</span>  disposed over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">second neck  72</span> . Once the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">sleeve  68</span>  is disposed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">core  66</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82">neck ring  82</span>  may be placed over the first end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">sleeve  68</span>  thereby compressing the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">sleeve  68</span>  between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82">neck ring  82</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first neck  70</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">core  66</span>  to substantially seal the end of the grip to prevent leakage of the gel. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">neck ring  72</span>  may fit snuggly on the end of the grip to seal the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">first end  78</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first neck  70</span> , or may be affixed with an additional adhesive or crimping, or otherwise secured to ensure a tight, secure seal.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0040]     After the seal is formed at between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first neck  70</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">first end  78</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">gel  42</span>  may be injected into the cavity at the opposite end of the grip between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">second neck  72</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">second end  80</span> . This step may be performed either before or after the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">core  66</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">sleeve  68</span>  are attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">head  62</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">hair brush  60</span> . It should also be noted that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">second neck  72</span>  in the illustrated embodiment is dimensioned to extend beyond the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">second end  80</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem68">sleeve  68</span>  to facilitate engagement with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem76">cap  76</span> . After the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82">neck ring  82</span>  is attached to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first neck  70</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem78">first end  78</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">post  64</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">hair brush  60</span>  is inserted into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">core  66</span>  through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">first neck  70</span>  with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82">neck ring  82</span>  abutting the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">head  62</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">hair brush  60</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82">neck ring  82</span>  may be configured such that the outer surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem82">neck ring  82</span>  aligns with the outer surface of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">head  62</span>  to form a substantially continuous surface between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">head  62</span>  and the handle.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0041]     To secure the grip assembly to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">head  62</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">core  66</span>  may be connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">post  64</span>  by an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem86">internal screw  86</span> , which is visible in  FIG. 8  through the cut-away portion of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">core  66</span> .
