After use, the lever 23 may be swung again to the position o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">f Fig. 4,</span> using the pin 1 as a pivot, and then swung to the inope<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">rative</span> position on top of the jaw member II as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. It   </p>
                    
                        <p>  desired, the free end 28 of this lever may be tapered and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">rounded and </span>reduced in thickness to provide a means for cleaning under the linger nail, and on its underside (which is the upper side when the lever is in the position of Figure 5) it may be cut or roughened, as shown at 29, to form a better grip for the thumb when using the device. Also it is preferred that the end portion of this lever be bent downward as shown at 36, Figure 5. This brings the portion 31 between this point and the free en<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">d 28 on a p</span>lane substantially parallel<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28"> with the bo</span>dy of the clipper, particularly when the lever is depressed into the position where the cutting edges grip and cut the nail, so that the thumb pressure is exerting a force on the pad rather than on the end of the lever. This bend also raises the free end 28 of the lever above the member 30 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">when in the </span>folded position of Figu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">re 2 to in</span> the inoperative position, and that this le in turn is provided with means for holding the lever against inadvertent movement laterally out of its closed position on the upper side of the upper jaw member, but that the lever may be readily swung to its operative position and the file may be readily exposed and swung to a position for use. The lugs 35 on the le are preferably located rela<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">tively c</span>lose to the pivotal mounting for the le, and also the free end of the operating lever, so&#39; that they will have the maximum holding eiect on the lever and will effectively prevent its being swung laterally out of its closed position on provide a clearance under this free end as shown at 38 for insertion of a thumb nail to facilitate raising the lever.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Through the opposite ends of the jaw members I0 yand Il is formed an opening whereby the device may be connected to a key ring, chain or the like, and pivotally mounted at this end is a nail le 30. This is a flat blade member c ut <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">on either s</span>urface, preferably the upper surface, to form the file 3|, and it may be reduced in thickness a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">nd roun</span>ded at its free end 32 to provide a means for cleaning u<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">nder the nai</span>l. It is pivotally mounted &#34;on the upper side of the upper jaw member I l by means of an eyelet 33 passing through the opening in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">members ll</span>l and ll and rolled over at its opposite ends to form securing flanges 34.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  ,This eyelet als<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">o passes through an openi</span>ng in the member to form a pivotal mounting for this member to allow it to be swung in a, plane substantially parallel to the plane of the members I0 and l l to a position on the top of the upper member II when not in use, or to be swung laterally, as shown in dotted lines Fig. 4, to a more exposed position for use than when lying over the upper member Il. When in the position on the top of the member ll, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, it lies under and is coveredl by the operating lever 23, so that it is protected a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">ndv prevented from </span>catching on clothing or Other objects. y   </p>
                    
                        <p>  On the opposite side edges of this le member ladjacent `its pivot 33, it is prov<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">ided with a, pair of upwardly exte</span>nding lugs 35 between which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem35">free end portion of the lev</span>er may seat and be held when in the closed or inoperative position of Figs. 1 and 2, and .prevent its inadvertently being swung from this position when carrying or not in use. The pivotal mounting for the le 30 is a fairly tight friction mounting so <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">it is </span>not loose to swing freely about the pivot, but it is tight enough for a frictional pivot so that the le is frictionally held in any position to which it may be swung, but still may be swung-to any of these positions by the operator, as desired. By using a ,tubular eyelet for the pivot mounting of the le, the opening through the end of the device for mounting it on a key-ring or chain is maintained.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It will be seen from the above that this novel construction and arrangement comprises a nail file and cleaning element which is normally covered or enclosed by the operating lever when the top of the le member during the carrying ioperation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Having thus set forth the nature of my invention, what I claim is:   </p>

                        <p>  2.
