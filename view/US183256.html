                        <p>  Specification forming part of Letters Patent No. [83,256, dated October 17, 1876; application filed September 23, 1876.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern: I   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Be it known that I, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">WILLIAM (3</span>. EDGE, of   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Newark, Essex county, New Jersey, have invented an Improved Finger-Nail Trimmer, of which the following is a specification Figure l is a longitudinal vertical section of my improved finger-nail trimmer, showing it sprung open. Fig. 2 is a similar View thereof, showing it closed. Fig. 3 is a front view and Fig. 4 a top view, of the same.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Similar letters of reference indicate corresponding parts in all the figures.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   This invention relates to an improved implement for trimming the nails of fingers and toes; and consists, principally, in the use of a concave cutter fastened to a pivoted bar, combined with another concave cutter which is attached to the frame of said pivoted bar, all as hereinafter more fully described.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the accompanying drawing, the letter A represents the fixed cutter, and B the movable cutter, of my trimmer. Both these outters are concave in form, the one B being somewhat smaller, and capable of fitting into the convex side of the cutter A. The cuttingedge of the cutter B is made slanting, as in Fig. 3, to produce a shear-like cut. The stationary cutter A is rigidly attached to the end of a frame or shell, 0, which, in its opposite end, carries the pivot a of the blade or bar D, to which the upper cutter B is fastened. A   </p>
                    
                        <p>  suitable spring, 12, is interposed between the parts 0 D to hold the two cutters separated,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  and yet allow them to be brought together. A suitable latch, d, may be applied to the frame 0, for the purpose of locking the bar D in the contracted or closed position. A penknife or other knife, E, may be pivoted in the bar D, or in the frame or shell 0, or more such knives may be applied in suitable manner; but these do not form a part of my present invention. The concavity of the knives A B is such that the nails of smaller or larger fingers may be conveniently and properly trimmed, whenever the instrument is applied,   </p>
                    
                        <p>  by alternately compressing and raising the WILLIAM 0. EDGE.   </p>
