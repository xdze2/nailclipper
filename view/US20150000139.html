                        <p>        STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]    Not Applicable  </p>
                    
                        <p>        FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0003]    The present invention lies in the field of implements. The invention relates to nail clippers comprising two legs extending in longitudinal direction, which are connected to one another with their one ends and the free ends of which form inner cutting edges, so as to cut through a finger or toenail between both cutting edges. In the alternative, the invention relates to nail clippers comprising two two-armed levers, which cross one another and which are articulated on one another at the crossing point, wherein the free levers of one side form inner cutting edges at their ends, so as to cut through a fingernail between both cutting edges, and wherein the free levers of the other side form handles.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0004]    It is known to produce nail clippers from two metal profiles, which are joined at one end. In addition to the joining, several additional operations are also required, such as the production of ribbing at the outer handle surfaces. Further grinding operations are also necessary.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]    A need exists to overcome the problems with the prior art systems, designs, and processes as discussed above.  </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0006]    The invention provides nail clippers that overcome the hereinafore-mentioned disadvantages of the heretofore-known devices and methods of this general type and that provide such features with in as few operating steps as possible.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]    According to the invention, both legs or arms, including the connecting area or the joint, are of a metallic glass or an amorphous metal in one piece.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]    The invention relates to nail clippers comprising two legs extending in longitudinal direction, which are connected to one another with their one ends and the free ends of which form inner cutting edges, so as to cut through a finger or toenail between both cutting edges. Both legs including the connecting area are of a metallic glass or an amorphous metal in one piece. The invention further relates to nail clippers comprising two two-armed levers, which cross one another and which are articulated on one another at the crossing point. The free levers of one side form inner cutting edges at their ends, so as to cut through a fingernail or toenail between both cutting edges, and the free levers of the other side form handles, wherein both two-armed levers including the joint in each case are of a metallic glass or an amorphous metal in one piece.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]    In the case of such a one-piece production, the entire pair of nail clippers with all of its parts and areas is produced in a single injection molding process, so that it is not necessary to subsequently fasten the legs of the nail clippers to one another and extensive machine finishing operations are no longer necessary.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]    With such an injection molding, the legs of the nail clippers and the connection location have a final shape that makes subsequent profiling, ribbing, and ribs unnecessary and even embellishments and the application of a logo already occur with the first operating process. From this, a high degree of creative freedom is created.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]    The chosen material is highly elastic, free from corrosion and has a high durability and a low wear/low abrasion. The production effort is extremely low. A pleasing visual appearance can be attained because more design and freedom/leeway/variances are at hand, in particular, due to certain designs of the surfaces, such as ergonomic shaping and/or ribbing.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]    Due to the fact that a machine finishing is not required or is hardly required, a significant amount of material is saved.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]    As a method for producing nail clippers of the above-mentioned type, it is preferable to inject the metallic glass or the amorphous metal into a mold, the cavity (cavities) of which form both legs of the clippers and the connecting area.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0014]    Preferably, the metallic glass or the amorphous metal of the nail clippers contains zirconium as base. Preferably, the individual parts of the nail clippers are produced in the injection molding process.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0038]    As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which can be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed structure. Further, the terms and phrases used herein are not intended to be limiting; but rather, to provide an understandable description of the invention. While the specification concludes with claims defining the features of the invention that are regarded as novel, it is believed that the invention will be better understood from a consideration of the following description in conjunction with the drawing figures, in which like reference numerals are carried forward.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0039]    Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the spirit or the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of exemplary embodiments of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0040]    Before the present invention is disclosed and described, it is to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. The terms “a” or “an”, as used herein, are defined as one or more than one. The term “plurality,” as used herein, is defined as two or more than two. The term “another,” as used herein, is defined as at least a second or more. The terms “including” and/or “having,” as used herein, are defined as comprising (i.e., open language). The term “coupled,” as used herein, is defined as connected, although not necessarily directly, and not necessarily mechanically.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0041]    Relational terms such as first and second, top and bottom, and the like may be used solely to distinguish one entity or action from another entity or action without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between such entities or actions. The terms “comprises,” “comprising,” or any other variation thereof are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion, such that a process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements does not include only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process, method, article, or apparatus. An element proceeded by “comprises . . . a” does not, without more constraints, preclude the existence of additional identical elements in the process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises the element.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0042]    As used herein, the term “about” or “approximately” applies to all numeric values, whether or not explicitly indicated. These terms generally refer to a range of numbers that one of skill in the art would consider equivalent to the recited values (i.e., having the same function or result). In many instances these terms may include numbers that are rounded to the nearest significant figure.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0043]    Herein various embodiments of the present invention are described. In the different embodiments, features are similar. Therefore, to avoid redundancy, repetitive description of these similar features may not be made in some circumstances. It shall be understood, however, that description of a first-appearing feature applies to the later described similar feature and each respective description, therefore, is to be incorporated therein without such repetition.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0044]    Described now are exemplary embodiments of the present invention. Referring now to the figures of the drawings in detail and first, particularly to  FIG. 1 , there is shown a first exemplary embodiment of nail clippers encompassing a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first leg  1</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second leg  2</span> . One end area of each of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">second legs  1</span> ,  2  is connected in one piece and in a positive manner to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">connecting area  3</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">free ends  4</span>  of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">second legs  1</span> , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> 2  form blade edges  5</span> ,  6 . At least one non-illustrated logo is embossed on the outer side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">connecting area  3</span>  but is not illustrated.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0045]    So that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">two blade edges  5</span> ,  6  can be pressed against one another, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">bolt  9</span>  protrudes from an inner side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">first leg  1</span>  close to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">blade edges  5</span> ,  6 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">bolt  9</span>  passes through an opening in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second leg  2</span>  and projects beyond the upper side of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second leg  2</span>  to such an extent that it passes through an opening, in particular, a hole, of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">single-edge toggle lever  10</span> , the free end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">toggle lever  10</span>  being able to be pressed by hand in a direction of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">second leg  2</span>  to move the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">two blade edges  5</span> ,  6  against one another.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0046]    The entire pair of nail clippers is a metallic glass or is an amorphous metal in one piece and is injected into an injection mold in an injection molding tool. The one cavity (i.e., hollow space) of the injection mold forms all of the parts of the clippers and, thus, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">both legs  1</span> ,  2  of the clippers and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">connecting area  3</span> , as well as forming all profiling, embellishments, ribbing, and ribs. From this, a machine finishing of the tool is no longer required. Thus, the finished clippers are produced in a single production process from a material that is highly elastic and free from corrosion while having a high durability and, thus, minimal wear.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0047]    The metallic glass or the amorphous metal has zirconium as basis.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0048]    The nail clippers according to  FIG. 2  are of the same materials but differ from the nail clippers according to  FIG. 1  in that the two legs are formed respectively by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">two-armed lever  1</span> ,  2 , <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">which levers  1</span> ,  2  cross one another and which are articulated on one another at a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">crossing point  11</span> . Regions of the lever arm that form the blade edges (e.g.,  5 ,  6 ) are significantly shorter than the regions of the lever arm forming the handles (e.g.,  7 ,  8 ). On the outer sides, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">legs  1</span> ,  2  respectively have an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">outer handle surface  7</span> ,  8 , which preferably includes ribbing or ribs. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">flexible tongue  12</span>  attached to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">handle  7</span>  is shaped to press the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">levers  1</span> ,  2  into an open position as shown.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0049]    It is noted that various individual features of the inventive processes and systems may be described only in one exemplary embodiment herein. The particular choice for description herein with regard to a single exemplary embodiment is not to be taken as a limitation that the particular feature is only applicable to the embodiment in which it is described. All features described herein are equally applicable to, additive, or interchangeable with any or all of the other exemplary embodiments described herein and in any combination or grouping or arrangement. In particular, use of a single reference numeral herein to illustrate, define, or describe a particular feature does not mean that the feature cannot be associated or equated to another feature in another drawing figure or description. Further, where two or more reference numerals are used in the figures or in the drawings, this should not be construed as being limited to only those embodiments or features, they are equally applicable to similar features or not a reference numeral is used or another reference numeral is omitted.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0050]    The phrase “at least one of A and B” is used herein and/or in the following claims, where A and B are variables indicating a particular object or attribute. When used, this phrase is intended to and is hereby defined as a choice of A or B or both A and B, which is similar to the phrase “and/or”. Where more than two variables are present in such a phrase, this phrase is hereby defined as including only one of the variables, any one of the variables, any combination of any of the variables, and all of the variables.  </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0051]    The foregoing description and accompanying drawings illustrate the principles, exemplary embodiments, and modes of operation of the invention. However, the invention should not be construed as being limited to the particular embodiments discussed above. Additional variations of the embodiments discussed above will be appreciated by those skilled in the art and the above-described embodiments should be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive. Accordingly, it should be appreciated that variations to those embodiments can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the following claims. </p>
