                        <p>  SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 244,891, dated July 26, 1881.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  Application filed June 9,1881. (1 lo model.)   </p>
                    
                        <p>  To all whom it may concern Be it known that we, EUGENE HEIM and OELEs&#39;rIN MATZ, both of Cincinnati, Hamilton county, Ohio, have jointly invented a new and useful Finger-N ail Trimmer, of which the following is a specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Our deviceconsists, essentially, of a pair of nipping-jaws composed of a single plate of spring-steel so formed and bent as to bring its cutting-edges in opposition and nearly in contact, and in association with this a means for closing said edges together, in which a yoke secured to one jaw afiords pivot-bearing fora cam-headed lever, whose operation presses the jaws forcibly together. This lever is preferably of flattened form, and is roughened on its rear surface to serve as a rasp, and from its free extremity projects a hook which serves as a glove-buttoning device. A small catch enables the user to lock the parts into compact form for the pocket, and a bow or bail enables suspension of the instrument from a belt .or Watch-chain.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a perspective view of our device in its folded condition. Fig. 2 is a section of the device in the plane of action. devicewith the cam-lever thrown back.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A represents a piece of plate-steel, which, having the represented inturned and curving cutting-edges a a formed upon it, is bent to a U form, so as to constitute a pair of nippingjaws, which stand normally some distance asunder, but which are capable ofbeing pressed toward one another so as to bring their cutting or nipping edges in contact. In order to enable this closure of said jaws to be effected with a yoke, B,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> whose perforated cheeks I) b receive 4</span> the pivot c of a cam-headed lever, 0, whose depression, as indicated by arrow&#39;in Fig. 2, operates to force the jaws closer together until Fig. 3 is a top view of our they&#39;meet, as shown in Fig. 1. On release of lever-pressure, as above, the resilience of the jaws causes their automatic separation, so as to facilitate another effective action.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   A portion of the rear surface of the camlever 0 may be grooved or roughened, c, to constitute a tile or rasp.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Pivoted at D to the bend of the jaws is a catch or clasp, E, whose hook, being forced to occupy a depression, 0, in the cam-lever, serves to hold the latter to the closed condition. The same pivot D also serves to couple to the instrument a bow or bail, F, by which the instrument may be suspended from a watch-chain or other object.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The free extremity of the cam-lover may possess the form of a hook, G, suitable for buttoning gloves.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   We are aware that fin ger-nail trimmers have been devised with two hinged jaws held normally gaping by a spring, and having separately-attached nipping-edges, the jaws being compressed by the direct pressure of the operators thumb and finger, and we therefore disclaim invention, broadly; but   </p>
                    
                        <p>  We claim as new and of our invention- 1. A pair of nail-clipping jaws, to a, formed of a single integral piece of steel, A, which jaws are held normally gaping by their resilience, and are closed by a cam-headed lever, G, substantially as set forth.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   2. The finger-nail trimmer consisting of U- formed plate A, yoke B, cam-headed lever G, and clasp E.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In testimony of which invention we hereunto set our hands.   </p>
