                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> The method employs attaching two handle/jaw pieces together with a third coverplate piece thereon in the hinge area so that a flange surface of the coverplate opposes a flange surface of one of the handles. A flange surface on the second handle similarly opposes a second flange surface of the first handle. These opposing flange surfaces together creates a type of modified box joint that is robust, accurate, and capable of simple disassembly. A joint in combination with a hand tool that employs this method. </p>
                    

                    <h4> Description </h4>
                    
                    
                        <p> FIELD OF INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]     This invention relates generally to the field of hand tool manufacturing. More particularly, the invention relates to a tool, such as a cuticle nipper, with a unique modified box joint system and a method of making the same.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        BACKGROUND OF INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0002]     Current methods for making hand tools typically entail either the use of a lap joint or a box joint for the joint system between the opposing handle elements.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]     The term hand tool herein includes any manual, or semi-manual, tool that has two counteracting arms that rotate about an axis, or pin. In no way is the example meant to limit the definition, but an example of the type of hand tools herein include cuticle nippers and the like.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]     In constructing a tool with a lap joint, the two handle/jaw pieces of the nipper are placed over each other so as to line up the hinging holes therein. A pin in driven through the two aligned hinging holes. The end of the pin is then peened over (e.g., struck with a force). The peened pin end(s) are then ground smooth so as to be relatively camouflaged on the outside of the joint. The nipper cutting jaw edges may then be hand sharpened and finished.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]     Contrastingly, in box joint construction, one of the two forged handle/jaw pieces has a “box”-type construct, that has a drilled or milled slot in it. The slot area of the box is heated and then expanded by driving a mandril through it. The second handle/jaw/blade piece is then inserted through this expanded, heated opening of the box. The opening is then beaten closed (e.g., struck with a force) locking together the two handle elements. A pin similarly is placed through the aligned holes; then peened to adjust tension; and ground as in the lap jaw. The nipper cutting jaw edges are then hand sharpened and finished.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]     Both lap joints and box joints have their inherent advantages and disadvantages.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]     Clearly, the lap joint is easier and cheaper to manufacture. The box joint is more robust, however. Both joint constructs with their overall manufacturing methods, including the peening and the heating and use of the mandril, result in free play between the jaws which then leads to undesirable “scissoring” of the jaws. Ultimately, neither joint is able to be easily and accurately sharpened and/or resharpened. Adjustment and/or readjustment of the tool and cleaning are also impracticable. The overall quality control of the resultant nipper, with either joint construction, is suspect.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]     Accordingly, there is a need in the field of hand tool manufacturing for an improved joint design and a method of making the same that offers advantages over the prior art joint construction types.   </p>
                    
                        <p>        SUMMARY OF INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0009]     The present invention provides an improved type ofjoint for use on hand tools, and the tool and methods of employing the same.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0010]     A first general aspect of the invention provides a method of making a jawed hand tool, the steps comprising:   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0011]     providing a first element having a first jaw distal to a first handle and a first flange surface therebetween;   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0012]     providing a second element having a second jaw distal to a second handle and a second flange surface and a third flange surface therebetween, further wherein said second flange surface and third flange surface are on opposing sides of said second element;   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0013]     providing a third element having a fourth flange surface;   </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0026]     Although certain embodiments of the present invention will be shown and described in detail, it should be understood that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the appended claims. The scope of the present invention will in no way be limited to the number of constituting components, the materials thereof, the shapes thereof, the relative arrangement thereof, etc., and are disclosed simply as an example of an embodiment. Although the drawings are intended to illustrate the present invention, the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0027]     Turning to the figures, an exploded perspective view of an embodiment of the invention, is depicted in  FIG. 1 , while  FIGS. 2-4  show various close-up views of details of the invention.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0028]      FIG. 1  shows an exploded view, in perspective, of an embodiment of a hand tool, denoted with a  10 , employing the aspects of the present invention. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">hand tool  10</span>  in this preferred embodiment is a nipper, or cuticle cutter. It should be noted that the invention may be employed in other hand tools that use opposing handles and jaws with a pivoting hinge. For example, pliers, scissors, wire cutters, bolt cutters, and the like.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0029]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">tool  10</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">first element  20</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">second element  40</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">third element  60</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">modified box joint  15</span>  of the present invention is located essentially in the hinge, or joint, area of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">tool  10</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">joint  15</span>  is located between a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">jaw  22</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">first element  20</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">jaw  42</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">second element  40</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">handle  21</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">first element  20</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">handle  41</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">second element  40</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0030]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">first element  20</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">jaw  22</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">handle  21</span> . Between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">jaw  22</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">handle  21</span>  is a hinge area. Part of the hinge area includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">first flange face  23</span>  with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">hole  25</span>  therethrough. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">hole  25</span>  may include <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">th<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">reads  25</span>  for receiving threads  72</span>  on a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">screw  70</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">first flange face  23</span>  may be ground, cut, or milled substantially flat.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0031]     Optionally, there may be a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem85">hinged locking element  85</span>  for locking the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">first element  20</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">second element  40</span>  together during non-use.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0032]     Similarly, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">second element  40</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">jaw  42</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">handle  41</span> . Between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">jaw  42</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem41">handle  41</span>  is a hinge area. Part of the hinge area includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">second flange face  43</span>  and an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">opposed third flange face  44</span>  with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem45">hole  45</span>  therethrough. The second and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">third flange faces  43</span> ,  44  may be ground, cut, or milled substantially flat.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0033]     Optionally, there may be a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">spring means  80</span>  for providing a spring bias between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">two elements  20</span> ,  40  during use. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem80">spring means  80</span>  may be a rotatably leaf spring (see  FIG. 1 ), a coil spring, or similar spring types located at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">joint  15</span>  or other areas of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">tool  10</span>  that provides a spring bias to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">jaws  22</span> ,  42  for opening.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0034]     A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">third element  50</span>  includes a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">fourth flange face  61</span>  with a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">hole  62</span>  therethrough. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">third element  50</span>  functionally acts, in some aspects, as a joint cover.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0035]     As  FIG. 1  depicts the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second elements  20</span> ,  40  are placed over each other so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">first flange face  23</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">second flange face  42</span>  abut. Similarly, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">third element  60</span>  is placed over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">second element  40</span>  so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem43">third flange face  43</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">fourth flange face  61</span>  similarly abut. The term abut means that the faces oppose each other and are adjacent. They need not contact each other. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">pin  70</span>  is placed to its <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">shank  72</span>  goes through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">various holes  62</span> ,  45 ,  25 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">pin  70</span>  may be a screw with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71">threads  7<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">1</span>  wherein corresponding threads  26</span>  located on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">hole  25</span>  through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">first flange face  23</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">pin  70</span>  serves as a hinge pin, of sorts, to allow for rotation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">elements  20</span> ,  40  around the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">pin  70</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0036]     Alternatively, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">pin  70</span>  may be a bolt (not shown) with a corresponding nut (not shown) that provides a similar rotating capability to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">tool  10</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0037]     As the sectional view close up in  FIG. 5  and the close up view in  FIG. 4  show more apparently, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">third element  60</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">first element  20</span>  may include corresponding configurations that provide added strength to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">joint  15</span>  once completed. For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">first element  20</span>  may include at <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">least one recess  28</span> A,  28 B that match is size and shape at <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">least one projection  66</span> A,  66 B located on the periphery of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">third element  60</span> . In this manner, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">third element  60</span>  may be slid horizontally into place over the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">second element  40</span>  so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">projections  66</span> A,  66 B slid into the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">recesses  28</span> A,  28 B. Once then the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">pin  70</span>  is placed, and if applicable, tightened, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">recesses  28</span> A,  28 B provide a location for increased purchase for the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">third element  60</span>  to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">first element  20</span> , via the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">projections  66</span> A,  66 B. Alternative types and shapes of means for increasing this purchase between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">third element  60</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">first element  20</span>  may be used. For example, detents, keys, keyways, and the like can be used. Alternatively, the end of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">third element  60</span>  may be substantially smooth, or unadulterated with any structural purchasing enhancements. That is the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">third element  60</span>  may be placed on top of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">first element  20</span>  so that the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">third element  60</span>  simply abuts and aligns with portions of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">first element  20</span> . The placement will allow free rotation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">second element  40</span>  between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">first element  20</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">third element  60</span>  (and vice versa). In whatever embodiment that is employed, as a result, when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">pin  70</span>  is placed, the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">third element  20</span> ,  60  effectively act as a monolithic joint construct (i.e., modified box joint) around the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">second element  40</span>  that is robust, strong, prevents scissoring of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">jaws  22</span> ,  42  and, yet, is readily able to be disassembled.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0038]      FIGS. 2, 3A , and  3 B, in particular, show close up view of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">jaws  22</span> ,  42  and their interplay. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">jaw  22</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">first element  20</span>  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">interior jaw face  31</span>  and an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">exterior jaw face  32</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem33">jaw edge  33</span>  that is formed between the two (See  FIG. 3A ). Similarly, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">jaw  42</span>  on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">second element  40</span>  includes an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">interior jaw face  51</span>  and an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">exterior jaw face  52</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">jaw edge  53</span>  that is formed between the two (See  FIG. 3B ).   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0039]     As  FIG. 2  shows, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">interior jaw faces  31</span> ,  51  lined up and face each other and abut when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">jaws  22</span> ,  42  of the tool are closed. Similarly, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">exterior jaw faces  32</span> ,  52  line up, when the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">jaws  22</span> ,  42  are closed, so that they form essentially a co-planar surface.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0040]     The uniformity in the construction of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">various flange faces  23</span> ,  43 ,  44 ,  61  provides for a high quality tool that has limited, or no, susceptibility to scissoring of the jaws over time. That is the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem31">interior jaw faces  31</span> ,  51  lined and match each other when the jaws are <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">closed  22</span> ,  42 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">flange faces  23</span> ,  43 ,  44 ,  61  also provide for an excellent “datum”, or attachment, surface for sharpening, cleaning, and the like, of the various parts of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">elements  20</span> ,  40  either prior to construction, or after use.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0041]     For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">tool  10</span>  can be placed on the material handling device, patented by this same inventor, under U.S. Pat. No. 6,821,193, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, for sharpening or other material handling (e.g., buffing, etc.). For example, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">tool  10</span>  could be taken apart and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">first element  20</span>  can be placed and clamped on the table of the handling device for subsequent sharpening. Similarly, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">second element  40</span>  can be sharpened at the device via similar methods and means.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0042]     Note that the FIGs. <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">throughout depicts flange faces  23</span> ,  43 ,  44 ,  61  that are substantially smooth. That is the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">faces  23</span> ,  43 ,  44 ,  61  may be ground or cut smooth after manufacture, or forged with <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">smooth faces  23</span> ,  43 ,  44 ,  51  during manufacture. Alternatively, the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">faces  23</span> ,  43 ,  44 ,  61  need not be an entirely smooth face. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">faces  23</span> ,  43 ,  44 ,  61  may, for example, have various depressions, projections, keying, detents, and the like (not shown), that would still allow for suitable rotation of the first and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">second elements  20</span> ,  40 . If employed, the use of any of these types of enhancements may further assist in the tracking of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">elements  20</span> ,  40  as they rotate about the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">joint  15</span>  so as to minimize scissoring of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">jaws  22</span> ,  42  and maximize the utility of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">tool  10</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0043]     While this invention has been described in conjunction with the specific embodiments outlined above, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the embodiments of the invention as set forth above are intended to be illustrative, not limiting. Various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims. </p>
