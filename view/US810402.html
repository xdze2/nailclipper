                        <p>  the object thereof is to provide a device of this class which is simple in construction and operation and which may also be used for vanous other purposes.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  The invention is fully disclosed in the following specification, of which the accompanying drawings form a part, inwhich the separate parts of my improvement are designated by suitable reference characters in each of the views, and in which Figure 1 is a sectional side view of my imroved nailclipper; Fig. 2, a section on the ine .2 2 of Fig. 1, and Fig. 3 a section on the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> line 3</span> 3 of Fig. 1.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In the practice of my invention I provide a nail clipper which comprises two handle members a and b, having shanks a and b whichare curved at an angle of about fortyfive degrees to the handle members and which are pivoted together at c in the manner of a pair of shears and each of which is provided with a pro&#39;ecting jaw d, said jaws being segmental in orm, as shown at d&#34;, and provided with inwardly-directed cutting edges (P.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In connecting the shanks a and b of the handle members a and b I form in one of said shanks a transverse recess a through which the other shank passes, and in the form of construction shown the recess a is formed in the shank a and the shank b is reduced in form and passes through said recess and is held therein by a transverse plate e, which is secured to the shank a by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> screws or bolts 6</span> The handle members a, and b are semicylindrical in cross section and are separated by a longitudinal slotf, and each of said handle members is provided with a longitudinal central space g, and the inner faces of said handle members are provided with a longitudinal slot or opening g and placed in each of members being also provid the longitudinal spaces g is a slide h, each of which is provided with a headed screw, pin,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem71"> or bolt 71</span>?, and said headed pins, screws, or bolts 7L pass outwardly through the corresponding slots h, and the slides h may be moved longitudinally of the handle members by means of said headed ins or bolts. One of the slides h is provide with a nail-file t and the other with a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> blade 7</span>&#39;, and said blade may be used in the manner of an ordinary knife-blade and the file i in the manner of ordinary devices of this class, and either said file or said blade may be projected through the end In of the handle members a and b b simply moving the stood, and when desired .or necessary they .slides h outwardly, as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> wi 1</span> be readily undermay be withdrawn into the handle members i i by moving said slides inwardly.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Between the separate handle members or between the shanks a, and 6 thereof is placed a spring m, which normally serves to separate said handle&#39;members and to &#39;open the jaws d, and the operation of this device in clipping or trimming nails will be the same as that of other devices of this class.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  It will thus be seen that I provide a combination tool or implement which may be used as a nail-clipper, as a nail-file, and is also provided. with a knife-blade which may be used for various purposes.   </p>
