Plaskon, 4 Val</span></span></span>ley View Ave., Derby, Conn. Filed Mar. 17, 1959, Ser. No. Stltidli 1 Claim. (Cl. 132-755) The present i<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">nvention is</span> directed to improvements in cutting appliances, and more specifically, to cutting appliances of the type normally referred to as nippers, and finding their greatest utilization as manicure appliances.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Appliances which may be generally described as above are -Well known and have experienced a high degree of acceptance by the public. Generally speaking, such devices consist of a pair of superposed spring arms having connected ends and opposed free ends, a cutting blade formed wholly on each of the opposed free ends, and leverage means for urging the arms towards one another to effect a cutting action. The prior art also provides for the connection of a pivctally mounted, laterally swingable tile member for use in association with the nipper in performing manicure operations.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The concept expressed above is conventional, and the present invention departs from this concept by means of several novel and useful improvements, each of which represents an important advance in the art.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   One of the aforesaid improvements resides in the novel formation and positioning of the cutting blades of the appliance described and illustrated herein. As before stated, it has been previously known to provide the appliance with a single pair of generally concave opposed blades positioned transversely of the extremities of the free end-s of the spring arms. In one form of appliance constructed and `assembled within the teachings of the instant invention, a pair of blades are also provided, but are positioned longitudinally of said free ends, at the lateral side edges of the spring arms. Further improvements in the formation of the blades are also provided and appear in more detail below. The change is positioning of the cutting blades, together with a novel angular formation thereof, has been found to result in a nipper of more efficient operation, increased ease of use and, hence, greater appear to &#39;the users of such appliances. The unique positioning of the cutting blade members results in a nipper which is readily usable in either hand of the user.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Additionally, in a second embodiment of the instant invention, a pair of generally convex, opposed blades are positioned transversely of the extremities of the spring arms, the convex blades being especially adapted for use in the trimming of the toenails.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   An additional object and advantage of the present invention is directed to the formation of the spring arms or main bodies of the nippers described herein of single blanks, thereby allowing the body portions thereof to be punched or struck from rsuitable sheet stock with the usual savings in cost of manufacture which result from such production methods.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Another object of this invention resides in the provision of improved means for releasably securing the leverage means of the devices in a non-operative position superimposed over the le member.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Also, the instant invention provides a novel means for engaging the file member in an operative position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>  ICC   </p>
                    
                        <p>   It is of interest to note that the unique formation of the end portions of the appliances hereinafter disclosed with a plurality of blade elements serve to rigidify the working portions thereof, thus resulting in appliances which are more etficient in operation and more durable in use.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Among the other objects and advantages of improved appliances constructed and assembled as described above, is the fact that such appliances are non-complex in construction and assembly, and inexpensive to manufacture.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Other and further objects and advantages of this invention will become more readily apparent from a consideration of the following specification, Awhen read in conjunction with the annexed drawings, in which:   </p>

                        <p>   Proceeding now to a more detailed description of the invention, general reference numeral 10 denotes one embodiment of a cutting appliance constructed and assembled within the broad scope of this invention. The appliance It) comprises a main body portion l2 consisting of superposed upper and lower spring clipper arms 14, 16. As seen in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">the dra<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">wing, the arms 14, 16 are </span></span>integrally joined at one pair<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14"> of the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16"> adja</span></span>cent ends thereof and diverge outwardly towards their opposing free ends. The formation of the arms is such that they are constantly biased away from one another, and these members are formed from a single blank of springable material, described in more detail below.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The outer end portions 18, 20, respectively, of t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">he arms<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20"> 14, 16, are enlarg</span></span>ed, and as seen in FIG<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">URES 5,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">   </p>
                    
                        <p>  6</span></span>, and 7 are bent to a position wherein they are substantially parallel with respect to one another. Each of the end portions 18 and 2li has concave cutting b<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">lades 22 formed </span>integrally o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">n the respective, opposed </span>side edges thereof, the blades of the end portion 20 contacting those of the end po<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">rtion 18 in edg</span>e-to-edge relation when <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">the arm 14 is u</span>rged toward the arm lr6. It is to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">be note</span>d that the blades 22 of each end portion are angularly d<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">isposed re</span>lative to the longitudinal plane of the end portion on which they are formed, in this illustration the angle being generally of 45 degrees.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The end portions 1S and 2t) are each centrally `apertured to receive a swivel bolt 24 having an enlarged head 26 and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> an opposing en</span>d 28. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">bolt is notched i</span>ntermed<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">iate its ends at</span> Sil and the notch is seen in the drawing to extend inwardly in the direction of the end 28.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   Reference numeral 32 identifies a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">n elong</span>ated lever arm having a slot 34 extending longitudinally inwardly fro<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">m one en</span>d 35 thereof.

As previously stated<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">, the ar</span>ms i4 an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">d 16 are</span> biased away from one another and, hence, this action of the arms locks the member 36 in the notch $0 and holds the lever<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36"> arm 32 in</span> place. A lug 38 is formed on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">the lever 32 </span>immediately <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">adjacen</span>t the inner end o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">f slot 34</span>, in longitudinal alignment therewith.<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34"> The for</span>egoing portions of the description of the `lever 32 and bolt 24 will be seen to provide<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32"> a means w</span>here<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">by the l</span>ever arm, when held in the position illustrated in FIGURE l or 6, may be used to exert force on <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">the spring arm</span> 14 and thereby urge the arms 14 an<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">d 16 towards o</span>ne another to their o<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">perativ<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">e cuttin</span></span>g position shown in phantom lines in FIGURE 6.   </p>

                        <p>   Additionally, it is of importance to note that the end 5d of the file adjacent the rivet 46 is somewhat extended therebeyond and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46"> has a V-</span>shaped notch 52 formed therein. As seen in <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">FIGURE 3, the poin</span>ted end of the lever 32 is engageable in the notch 52 when t<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">he lever </span>is in the non-use pos<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">ition the</span>reof and the iile is in its extended position, and by this arrangement the le is locked in its normal use position.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   The clipping operation of the appliance 16 is best illustrated in FIGURE 6 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">wherein it is</span> seen that the lever 32 is inverted to the position of FIGUR<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">E l, that</span> is, with the lug 38 bearing directly against the outer sur<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">face of</span> the spring arm i4. As stated in the objects of invention, the device is equally adaptable to the trimming of the finger nails of either hand by reason of the unique positioning and formation of the cutting blades 22. The positioning of said bl<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">ades at the latera</span>l edges of the appliance, coupled with the fact that the blades are disposed at such angle as to have their cutting edges project outwardly from the main body, thereby enables the user to grasp the appliance in either hand, and to easily and accurately trim the nails of his other hand.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   In FIGURE 4, the blank from &#39;which the main body 12 `of the first embodiment it) of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">the invention</span> is formed is shown in plan view.

The end portions i8, 2i) <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">are for<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">med by bendi</span></span>ng the arms 14 and 16 about the fold lines N2 and 11<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">64, res<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">pectivel</span></span>y, adjacent to but spaced from each of the distal ends of the blank. Additionally, a pair of laterally outwardly projecting blade forming members 106 <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem106">yare provided on the blank on the opposed sid</span>es of the portions thereof forming `the end portions 18, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">2li. Spaced inwardly from the outer ends of </span>said `blade forming members are curvilinear fold lines 1li@ about which the blade forming members ill are folded for forming the cutting blades 22. The blank is also aperture<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">d at suitable loca</span>tions to provide for the insertion of the rivet 46 and the bolt 24.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   FIGURES S throu<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">gh l1, in</span>clusive,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24"> are ill</span>ustrative of a second embodiment litio of this invention wherein the various structural members which are substantially the same as those lshown and described with regard to the embodiment l@ are denoted by a similar reference character having the letter a added thereto. The second embodiment itin diiiers from the iirst embodiment 10, and from the prior art, in the formation of a pair of end blade forming members 2e@ positioned transversely of the outer extremities of the end portions 18a, 20a. As Seen in the drawings, the blade members 200 are convex in conguration a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem200">nd are angularly i</span>nclined outwardly with respect to the aforesaid end portions 18a, 2da, and are yadapted to be moved into edge-to-edge contact in order to perform their cutting operation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   As stated in the objects of invention, the convex formation of the blades 20h, coupled with the angular inclination thereof relative to the end portions 18a, 20a, renders them especially adaptable `to the trimming of toenails. Furthermore, the rigidifying effect of the formation of a total of three blades on each end portion further improves the operation and durability of the appliance.   </p>
                    
                        <p>   in FIGURE 8, the blank for the formation of the main body 12a of the appliance 10a is seen to be substantially the s ne `as the blank of EEGURE 4.
