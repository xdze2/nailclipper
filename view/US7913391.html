                        <p>      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Various types of nail clippers are known in the prior art. Prior art patents provide a nail clipper with a depth gauge which determines the length of the nail being cut, as well as a nail clipper with an anti-tilt lever and various nail depth trimming positions. Another patent teaches a nail clipper with two cutting members and a lever arm that having an angled portion used for leverage. However, what is needed is a nail clipper apparatus formed of thick steel and having a broad textured contoured handle lever providing a slip-free surface which substantially conforms to a user&#39;s thumb thereby increasing gripping capacity, a broad base for more substantial working surface, an aperture accommodating passage of a chain therethrough to facilitate portability and also providing a nail file. The nail clipper may also provide a curved nail length determining gauge member as a depth stop feature provided in range of predefined increments.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present invention relates to nail care, and more particularly, to a nail clipper apparatus which makes cutting a nail to a desired length easier due to its broad textured contoured handle lever and its broad base and as well as the angle between an upper arm and the handle lever, and curved depth stop and which also provides a nail file.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present nail clipper apparatus is formed of thick steel and has a broad textured contoured handle lever providing a slip-free surface which substantially conforms to a user&#39;s thumb, which is larger than handle levers on conventional nail clippers, and providing a handle lever disposed at an angle to an upper arm in a range of about 0 to 30 degrees, thereby increasing gripping capacity, a broad base for more substantial working surface, a pair of complementary beveled, sharp-edged cutting jaws, an aperture accommodating passage of a chain therethrough to facilitate portability and further includes a nail file. The present nail clipper may also include a curved nail length determining depth stop feature provided in range of predefined increments  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The instant nail clipper apparatus enables an individual to more accurately and precisely clip fingernails and toenails due to the increased thickness of the handle lever and the increased gripping capabilities as well as the design of the cutting jaws. The present nail clipper is also designed to reduce movement from side-to-side during use as often experienced in using traditional nail clippers. With the increased ease of use, also comes savings in time and effort. The present nail clipper also assists individuals who have arthritis or similar debilitating health problems to quickly and easily cut fingernails and toenails due to the increased size and gripping capacity. One embodiment also features a five-star raised contour on the handle lever further decreasing the potential for slippage.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  </p>
                    
                        <p>      With reference now to the drawings, and in particular  FIGS. 1 through 8  thereof, example of the instant nail clipper apparatus employing the principles and concepts of the present nail clipper apparatus and generally designated by the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">reference number  10</span>  will be described.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Referring to  FIGS. 1 through 6  and  8 , one embodiment of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">present nail clipper apparatus  10</span>  is illustrated. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span>  has generally mirror image arms comprising an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper arm  20</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lower arm  26</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper arm  20</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">front end  22</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">rear end  24</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lower arm  26</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">forward end  28</span>  and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">rearward end  30</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper arm  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lower arm  26</span>  are conjoined at a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem32">connection point  32</span>  between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">rear end  24</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">rearward end  30</span> . On the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">front end  22</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">forward end  28</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper arm  20</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lower arm  26</span> , respectively, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">each arm  20</span> ,  26  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">complementary upper cutting jaw member  34</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">lower cutting jaw member  36</span> , respectively. Each of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper arm  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lower arm  26</span>  has an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">upper side  38</span>  and an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">underside  40</span> . Each of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">upper cutting jaw member  34</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">lower cutting jaw member  36</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">cutting edge  37</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">cutting edge  37</span>  of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">each cutting jaw member  34</span> ,  36  facing toward one another and spaced apart so as to receive therebetween a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem85">fingernail  85</span>  or a toenail (not shown). The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">cutting edges  37</span>  are beveled. Further, an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">s-shaped handle lever  44</span> , which is pivotally connected by means of <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">a terminal force transmission crossbar  56</span>  to a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">connecting pin  58</span>  which extends oscillatably through <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem61">aligned holes  61</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">arms  20</span> ,  26 , operationally engages the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem37">cutting edges  37</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">unitary handle lever  44</span>  has an elongated, <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">spatular rear portion  46</span> , a s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">ubstantially parallelepiped mid-portion  48</span> , a sub<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">stantially parallelepiped front portion  51</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">top side  53</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem54">bottom side  54</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">mid-portion  48</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem49">first edge  49</span>  and an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">opposite second edge  50</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">rear portion  46</span>  is rounded, gently narrows toward the mid-portion first edge, and is substantially perpendicular to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">mid-portion  48</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">rear portion  46</span>  substantially conforms to the size and shape of an average human thumb to prevent slippage of a thumb from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span>  during use. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">mid-section  48</span>  is disposed at about a 90 degree angle to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper arm  20</span>  thereby making the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">handle lever  44</span>  easier for a user to depress than a conventional nail clipper. Thus, the angle between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper arm  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">handle lever  44</span>  is preferably within the range of about 0 to 30 degrees when in a working position. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">front portion  51</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem52">rear edge  52</span>  which connects to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">mid-por<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">tion  48</span>  second edge  50</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem51">front portion  51</span>  is parallel to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">rear portion  46</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">connecting pin  58</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59">lower end  59</span>  and an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">upper end  60</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">pin  58<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem59"></span>  lower end  59</span>  has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem62">flange  62</span>  which retains the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">pin  58</span>  in position at the lower end, while the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem60">upper end  60</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">pin  58</span>  projects above the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper arm  20</span>  and has a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem64">hooked recess  64</span>  in which the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem56">crossbar  56</span>  is engaged thereby retaining the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">handle lever  44</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">pin  58</span>  assembled with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">arms  20</span> ,  26 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">handle lever  44</span>  rotationally and pivotally engages the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem58">pin  58</span>  whereby the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span>  is placed into a working position and a closed position. In working position, the angle between the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper arm  20</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">handle lever  44</span>  is in a range of about 0 to 30 degrees and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem48">mid-por<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem50">tion  48</span>  second edge  50</span>  forms a fulcrum wherein the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">handle lever  44</span>  selectively forces the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">upper cutting jaw member  34</span>  to contact the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem36">lower cutting jaw member  36</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">handle <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">lever  44</span>  top side  53</span>  is completely textured. The texture may be in the form of a sandblasted surface. A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">raised contour  72</span>  may be disposed near a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem47">rearward edge  47</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem44">handle <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem53">lever  44</s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem46">pan>  top side  53</span>  rear portion  46</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">raised contour  72</span>  is designed to provide a user with increased gripping capability. The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">raised contour  72</span>  is convex and is provided in a variety of shapes which may include a 5-star appearance as illustrated in the drawings or in the form of a triangle or any other desired shape.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75">nail file  75</span>  is disposed on and covers the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">entire underside  40</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lower arm  26</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem75">nail file  75</span>  is formed of plurality of pa<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem70">rallel equidistantly positioned grooves  70</span>  running continuously diagonally across the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem40">underside  40</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lower arm  26</span> .  </p>
                    
                        <p>      A <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">round aperture  66</span>  runs continuously through the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">upper a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">rm  20</span>  rear end  24</span>  and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lower a<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem30">rm  26</span>  rearward end  30</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem66">aperture  66</span>  accommodates passage of a chain therethrough to facilitate portability the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">present apparatus  10</span>  to be attached to key chain for easy portability and convenient access.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      The present nail clipper may include a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">gauge member  42</span>  as shown in  FIGS. 1 through 6  and  8 . The su<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">bstantially parallelepiped gauge member  42</span>  follows the curvature of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem34">cutting jaw members  34</span> ,  36 . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">gauge member  42</span>  is disposed on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem38">upper side  38</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem26">lower arm  26</span>  near an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">outside edge  29</span>  of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">forward end  28</span>  and substantially transverses the width of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem28">forward end  28</span> . The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">gauge member  42</span>  is disposed in a range of widths away from the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem29">outside edge  29</span>  thereby allowing selection of a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">nail clipper  10</span>  which accommodates a desired nail length trimming position.  </p>
                    
                        <p>      Another embodiment of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">present nail clipper  10</span> , which is identical to the above-described embodiment but without the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem72">raised contour  72</span>  and <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem42">gauge member  42</span>  is illustrated in  FIG. 7 .  </p>
