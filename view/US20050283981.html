                        <h4> Abstract </h4>
                        <p> A nail cutting device which consists essentially of two pairs of scissors connected together by a special mechanism which allows them to cut in two opposite directions, the angle between the two directions of cut can range between 180 to 90 degrees with an option to be adjusted. The device has one pair of handles and one holds and operates it in the same way one uses regular scissors. This way, one can cut one&#39;s toenails in two directions, left and right, without changing the grip on the scissors handles, using the same finger movements and avoiding any uncomfortable twisting of the hand or other part of the body. </p>

                        <p> DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>      SUMMARY   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0001]     In general the two directional scissors is a combination of two pair of scissors connected together, enabling the user to cut in two directions without changing the grip on the handles.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0002]     One of the pairs which comprises of handles arms and blades will be referred to as the main pair. The other pair which includes arms and blades but not handles, will be referred to as the secondary pair   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0003]     The two pairs are connected together by a special mechanism, which allows them to cut in two opposite directions; the angle between the two directions of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180"> cut can range between 180</span> to 90 degrees.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0004]     In the case where the two pairs are pointing exactly in opposite directions or, in other words, the angle between them is 180 degrees, the connecting mechanism that requires is different then the one requires when the angle between the directions of cuts is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180"> not exactly 180</span> degrees.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0005]     The drawings form a part of this specification.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0006]     In the drawings the sizes and the proportions between the various components can vary, and so the scales of the drawings.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0007]     A dotted line numbered with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> prefix ‘R’ (like R 1</span> ,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> R 2</span>  etc.) in the drawing represents an axis of rotation of a rotating object.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0008]     A dotted line numbered with the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> prefix ‘S’ (like S 1</span> ,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> S 2</span> , etc. in the drawing represents a bisector of an angle.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0009]     The drawings are diagrammatic.  </p>

                        <p>      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION   </p>
                    
                        <p>        [0032]     With reference to the drawing, the two directional scissors consist of a main pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> scissors P 1</span> , and a secondary pair of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> scissors P 2</span> , which are connected together by a special mechanism.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0033]     Each pair comprises two arms with blades that are connected by a pivoting pin.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0034]     Shown in  FIGS. 1, 2 ,  7  and  8 , are the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1">main pair blades  1</span> ,  1   a , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">main pair pivoting pin  2</span> , the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">secondary pair blades  3</span> ,  3   a , and the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4">secondary pair pivoting pin  4</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0035]     The two way scissors can be made either with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> P 2</span>  and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> P 1</span>  are pointing to the exact opposites from each other or, the angle between the directions of the cut by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> P 1</span>  and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> P 2</s<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180">pan>  c<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90">ould be varied between 180 and 90</span></span> degrees.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0036]     The way of connecting the main pair to the secondary pair is determined by<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> whether both P 1</span>  and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> P 2</span>  point to the exact opposite from each other or not.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0037]     Before continuing, the terms “direction of cut” and “exact opposite direction” has to be clarified:   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0038]     While cutting, each arm of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> P 1</span>  performs a rotating movement around the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">pivoting pin  2</span> ; the rotating movement define a plane in space, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> dotted line R 1</span>  shows the axis of rotation for the movement which is perpendicular to that plane. In that plane, the two arms of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> P 1</span>  create an angle with the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2">pivoting pin  2</span>  at it vertex, the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> dotted line S 1</span>  shows the bisector of that angle.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0039]     In the same way,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> R 2</span>  is the axis of rotation of the arms of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> P 2</span>  and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> S 2</span>  is the bisector of the angle they form with its vertex at  4 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0040]     The term “direction of cut” means direction along the vertex of the angle that the arms are forming, the term “exact opposite” means that<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> S 1</span>  and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> S 2</span>  are parallel to each other, and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> also R 1</span>  and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> R 2</span>  are parallel to each other, the term “angle between the direction of cuts” means the angle between<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> S 1</span>  and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> S 2</span>  when they are in the same plane, or the angle between the two planes created by the movements of the arms of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> P 1</span>  and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> P 2</span> . When the two pairs points to the exact opposites, the angle between the directions of cuts is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180"> exactly 180</span> degrees.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0041]     In the case is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> where P 1</span>  and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> P 2</span>  point to the exact opposites as seen in FIGS.  7  to  11 , each arm of the secondary pair is connected to an arm of the main pair by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem10">one pivoting pin  10</span>  and  10   a  with axes of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> rotation R 5</span>  and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> R 5</span>   a . In that<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> case R 1</span> ,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> R 2</span> ,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> R 5</span>  and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5"> R 5</span>   a  are all parallel to each other.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0042]     The other case where the angle between the direction of cut of<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> P 1</span>  and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> P 2</span>  is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem180"> less then 180</span> degrees and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem90"> greater then 90</span> degrees is shown in FIGS.  1  to  6 . In that case, each connecting mechanism between the arms of the main pair the secondary pair, have to allow both arms a free rotation along two different axes in space relative to each other, these axes are shown as<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> R 3</span>  and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> R 4</span>  in  FIGS. 1, 2 ,  3 ,  4 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0043]     That ability to rotate freely along two different axes in space enables both pairs to perform a smooth cutting movement in the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> case where P 1</span>  and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> P 2</span>  do not point to the exact opposites.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0044]     The connecting mechanism between the arms of the main pair and the<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem1"> secondary pair where P 1</span>  and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem2"> P 2</span>  do not point to the exact opposites is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem5">numbered  5</span>  in FIGS.  1  to  6 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0045]     As best seen in  FIG. 3 , each connecting mechanism comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">pivoting frame  8</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">pivot pin  9</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">rotating axle  6</span> , and an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">axle support  7</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0046]     Each pivoting frame is connected to one arm of the main pair by <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">pivot pin  9</span> , which allows free rotation of the pivoting frame relative to the arm of the main pair, with<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> R 3</span>  as the axis of rotation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0047]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">axle support  7</span>  is fixed to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">pivoting frame  8</span> . The axle support has the shape of a tube which allows free rotation of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">rotating axle  6</span>  relative to the pivoting frame, With<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> R 4</span>  as the axis rotation.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0048]     Each of the blades of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3">secondary pair  3</span>  is fixed to one of the rotating axles. As seen in FIGS.  1  to  3 , the rotating connections mechanism allows the arm of the secondary pair a free rotation along two axes in space relative to the arm of the main pair, one is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem3"> R 3</span> , the axis of rotation at the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">pivoting frame  8</span>  and the other axis is<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem4"> R 4</span> , the axis of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6">rotating axle  6</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0049]     FIGS.  12  to  16  are showing another mechanism that can be added to the two directional scissors to enable manual adjustment of the angle between the two pairs shown in FIGS.  1  to  6  and is referred to as the adjustment mechanism. It is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">numbered  17</span>  in FIGS.  12  to  16 , and can replace the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem8">pivoting frame  8</span>  shown in FIGS.  1  to  7 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0050]     The <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem17">adjustment mechanism  17</span>  comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">pivoting plate  18</span>  connected to another <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">plate  19</span>  by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem20">hinge  20</span> , a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem25">spring  25</span>  that pushes the plates away from each other towards wider angle, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem21">screw  21</span>  that connected in one side to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">plate  18</span>  by a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem23">pivoting pin  23</span> , and the other side go through a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem24">rectangle slot  24</span>  in the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">plate  19</span> , and a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">round nut  22</span>  for adjusting the opening angle between <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem18">plates  18</span>  and  19 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0051]     The adjustment mechanism is connected on one side to the arm of the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem9">main pair via pivoting pin  9</span>   a  and on the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem19">other side plate  19</span>  is connected to the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7">axle support  7</span>   a . By rotating the <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem22">nut  22</span>  the user can adjust the angle between the main pair and the secondary pair.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0052]     It will be apparent that some changes and modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention defined in the claims. Thus, the connecting mechanism can be replaced by an alternate one, as long as it allows both arms connected a free rotation along two different axes in space.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0053]      FIGS. 17, 18 , show alternative structure to the connecting mechanism that is different from the one seen in FIGS.  1  to  6 .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0054]     As best seen in.  FIG. 13  the alternative connecting mechanism which is <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem11">numbered  11</span> , it comprises a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem12">rotating axle  12</span>  fixed in both sides to the arm of the main pair, an <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">axle support  13</span>  in a shape of a tube another <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem15">axle support  15</span>  in a shape of a tube, a <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem14">support base  14</span>  that is connected to <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem13">both axle supports  13</span>  and  15 , and another <span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem16">rotating axle  16</span> , which is fixed to one of the blades of the secondary pair.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0055]     This structure allows the arms of both pairs a free rotation along two axes of rotation in space,<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem6"> R 6</span>  and<span class="highlightfromlegend legenditem7"> R 7</span> .   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0056]     Also, the size of the components the proportions between the size of the components, and the angle between the main pair and the secondary pair, can be changed without departing from the scope of the invention defined in the claims.   </p>
                    
                        <p>          [0057]     One holds and operates the scissors by the handles of the main pair, in the same manner as one would operate regular scissors. </p>
